","COMMISSION DECISION of 11 September 1973 on aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant for extending an oil refinery at Antwerp (province of Antwerp) and for setting up a new refinery at Kallo (province of East Flanders)  (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)  (73/293/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof;
Having, pursuant to Article 93, given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments and having considered those comments;     I.  Whereas, by letter of 23 August 1972 from its Permanent Representative, the Belgian Government, pursuant to Article 93 (3) EEC, informed the Commission of its intention to grant certain aid for investments made by two oil companies, the one for extending an oil refinery at Antwerp and the other for setting up a new oil refinery at Kallo;
Whereas the refining capacity in Belgium will be considerably increased as a result of those investments;
Whereas the information supplied by the Belgian Government indicates that the aid in question will be granted pursuant to the Law of 17 July 1959 instituting and coordinating measures to encourage economic expansion and the setting up of new industries;
Whereas the aid will consist:    - in the case of the Antwerp refinery, of interest rate subsidies of 2 % for three years on a loan of Bfrs 4.570 million and of 3 % for three years on a loan of Bfrs 1.430 million and also exemption for three years from the tax on land and buildings;
- in the case of the Kallo refinery, of an interest rate subsidy of 2 % for three years on a loan of Bfrs 4.300 million and also exemption for three years from the tax on land and buildings;
Whereas the aids are such as to affect trade between Member States and to threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1).
II.  Whereas the economic and social situation of the regions and areas in which the new investments receiving aid are located are not such as would warrant applying the exceptions made under Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aid to promote the development of certain areas to the aids which the Belgian Government intends to grant,  Whereas growth in the province, and in particular in the district of Antwerp, is very rapid ; whereas, in view of the investments which have been made and which are likely to be made in this area, the current shortage of labour may be expected to become more acute ; whereas the gross domestic product per inhabitant in this area is among the highest in the Community;
Whereas expansion in the province of East Flanders and the district of St Niklaas where Kallo is located is likewise particularly rapid ; whereas this province, which, through its proximity, benefits from Antwerp's own expansion, is particularly attractive for new investments ; whereas its situation, from the point of view of employment or standard of living of the population, does not give rise to any concern;
Whereas, moreover the districts of Antwerp and of St Niklaas are not within the regions or areas in respect of which the Commission, in its Decision 72/173/EEC of 26 April 1972 on aid granted under the Belgian Law of 30 December 1970 on economic expansion, authorized the Belgian Government to grant regional aid.
III.  Whereas, firstly, the refining industry and its undertakings face no particular difficulty in Belgium whether from the point of view of their structures or of their own ability to expand ; whereas, on the contrary, production capacities in Belgium already far exceed the needs of the domestic market and the forecasts which are at present possible of trends in these two variables during the years ahead indicate that there will be a continued surplus which will even increase considerably;
Whereas the Commission, in exercising the powers vested in it by Article 92 (3) EEC, should not therefore except from Article 92 (1) EEC which provides for the incompatibility of aids defined in that paragraph, measures which would contribute to further the development of this industry, by granting those measures the benefit of the exemption provided under Article 92 (3) (c) EEC for ""aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities"", there being no justification for such measures;
Whereas, furthermore, it is characteristic of the petroleum industry that when refining capacity is available there is advantage in making the maximum use of it since the proportional element in refining costs is relatively small ; whereas, however, if there are any surpluses, however small, on the market for petroleum products those surpluses have a considerable depressing influence on prices and are therefore likely to upset the financial equilibrium of the refining industry of the Community.
Whereas the aids planned by the Belgian Government are therefore such as to ""adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest"" and cannot for that very reason be exempted under Article 92 (3) (c) EEC, since this provision allows aids to be considered compatible with the Common Market only of they facilitate the development of certain economic activities without producing any adverse effect;
Whereas, moreover, the aids clearly do not qualify for exemption under Article 92 (2) or Article 92 (3) (b) EEC;
IV.  Whereas, when submitting its comments, the Belgian Government declared itself prepared to limit the aids originally proposed only to investments directed towards the elemination, by the two refineries concerned, of the pollution they cause;
Whereas, however, it is the responsibility of Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the undertakings themselves, under the principle of ""the polluter pays"" meet the costs of protecting the environment from the harmful effects of their activities ; whereas aids can be exempted from this rule only if it can be proved that full application of the rule might give rise to particular difficulties especially of a regional or industrial nature, and that those difficulties can only be overcome by enabling the industries concerned to make the necessary alterations to their existing production plants.
Whereas, in this case under consideration, an examination of the situation of the undertakings which would benefit from the aids proposed by the Belgian Government, of the regions and areas where the new investments are to be made and of the sector of industrial activity to which the undertakings belong, does not indicate that any such difficulties exit,","{'title': '73/293/EEC: Commission Decision of 11 September 1973 on aid which the Belgian Government intends to grant for extending an oil refinery at Antwerp (province of Antwerp) and for setting up a new refinery at Kallo (province of East Flanders) (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium shall not grant the aids which, as notified to the Commission by letter of 23 August 1972 from its Permanent Representative, it intended to grant towards the extension of an oil refinery at Antwerp and towards the setting up of a new refinery at Kallo.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 September 1973.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nThe President\n\nFrançois-Xavier ORTOLI'}]}"

laying down exceptional measures as regards the release of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose on the Union market at reduced surplus levy during the 2012/2013 marketing year
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1) and in particular Article 64(2) and Article 186, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) During the 2011/2012 sugar marketing year, the Union average bulk white sugar ex-factory price reached a level of 175 % of the reference price of EUR 404/tonne and was approximately EUR 275/tonne higher than the world market price. The Union price is now stable at a level of around EUR 700/tonne, which is the highest level reached since the reform of the sugar market organisation and disturbs the optimal fluidity of the sugar supply on the Union market. The expected increase of this already high price level during the 2012/2013 marketing year substantiates the risk of serious market disturbances which should be prevented by the necessary measures.
(2) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/2013, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 0,5 million tonne than in 2011/2012. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.
(3) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 5 400 000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/2013 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 2 000 000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.
(4) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/2013.
(5) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.
(6) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities. Article 3(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 967/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards sugar production in excess of the quota (2) has fixed that levy at EUR 500 per tonne.
(7) For a limited quantity of sugar produced in excess of the quota, a reduced surplus levy should be fixed at a level per tonne allowing for a fair treatment of Union sugar producers, ensuring the good functioning of the Union sugar market and helping to reduce the difference between Union and world market sugar prices without creating risks of accumulation of surpluses in the Union market.
(8) As Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 fixes quotas for both sugar and isoglucose, a similar measure should apply for an appropriate quantity of isoglucose produced in excess of the quota because the latter product is, to some extent, a commercial substitute for sugar.
(9) With a view to increasing the supply, sugar and isoglucose producers should apply to the competent authorities of the Member States for certificates allowing them to sell certain quantities, produced above the quota limit, on the Union market with a reduced surplus levy.
(10) The reduced surplus levy should be paid after the application is admitted and before the certificate is issued.
(11) The validity of the certificates should be limited in time to encourage a fast improvement of the supply situation.
(12) Fixing upper limits of the quantities for which each producer can apply in one application period and restricting the certificates to products of the applicant’s own production should prevent speculative actions within the system created by this Regulation.
(13) With their application, sugar producers should commit themselves to pay the minimum price for sugar beet used to produce the quantity of sugar for which they apply. The minimum eligibility requirements for applications should be specified.
(14) The competent authorities of the Member States should notify the Commission of the applications received. In order to simplify and standardise those notifications, models should be made available.
(15) The Commission should ensure that certificates are granted only within the quantitative limits fixed in this Regulation. Therefore, if necessary, the Commission should be able to fix an allocation coefficient applicable to the applications received.
(16) Member States should immediately inform the applicants whether the quantity applied for was fully or partially granted.
(17) The competent authorities should notify the Commission of the quantities for which certificates with a reduction of the surplus levy have been issued. For this purpose, models should be made available by the Commission.
(18) Sugar quantities released on the Union market of quantities in excess of the certificates issued under this Regulation should be subject the surplus levy set out in Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. It is therefore appropriate to provide that any applicant not fulfilling his commitment to release on the Union market the quantity covered by a certificate delivered to him, should also pay an amount of EUR 500 per tonne. This consistent approach is aimed at preventing abuse of the mechanism introduced by this Regulation.
(19) For the purpose of establishing average prices for quota and out-of-quota sugar on the Union market in accordance with Article 13(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 952/2006 of 29 June 2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 as regards the management of the Community market in sugar and the quota system (3), sugar covered by a certificate issued pursuant to this Regulation should be considered as quota sugar.
(20) In accordance with Article 2(1)(a) of Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom of 7 June 2007 on the system of the European Communities’ own resources (4) contributions and other duties provided for within the framework of the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector are to constitute own resources. It is therefore necessary to set the date of establishment of the amounts in question within the meaning of Articles 2(2) and Article 6(3)(a) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1150/2000 of 22 May 2000 implementing Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom on the system of the European Communities own resources (5).
(21) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '23.3.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 84/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 281/2013\nof 22 March 2013\nlaying down exceptional measures as regards the release of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose on the Union market at reduced surplus levy during the 2012/2013 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) During the 2011/2012 sugar marketing year, the Union average bulk white sugar ex-factory price reached a level of 175\xa0% of the reference price of EUR 404/tonne and was approximately EUR 275/tonne higher than the world market price. The Union price is now stable at a level of around EUR 700/tonne, which is the highest level reached since the reform of the sugar market organisation and disturbs the optimal fluidity of the sugar supply on the Union market. The expected increase of this already high price level during the 2012/2013 marketing year substantiates the risk of serious market disturbances which should be prevented by the necessary measures.\n\n((2)) Based on the estimated supply and demand for 2012/2013, the ending stocks for the sugar market are expected to be lower by at least 0,5\xa0million tonne than in 2011/2012. This figure already takes into account the imports from third countries benefiting from certain preferential agreements.\n\n((3)) On the other hand, the expectations of a good harvest lead to estimate the production of nearly 5\xa0400\xa0000 tonnes in excess of the sugar quota set out in Article 56 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. Taking account of the foreseeable contractual commitments of sugar producers in respect of certain industrial uses provided for in Article 62 of that Regulation and of the 2012/2013 export commitments for out-of-quota sugar, substantial quantities of out-of-quota sugar of at least 2\xa0000\xa0000 tonnes would still be available. Part of this sugar could be made available to alleviate the tight supply of the Union sugar food market and to avoid excessive price increases.\n\n((4)) In order to ensure the fluidity of the market, it is necessary to release out-of-quota sugar. It should be possible to take such a measure each time it is necessary during the marketing year 2012/2013.\n\n((5)) Pursuant to Articles 186 and 188 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 measures may be taken, when necessary, to remedy market disturbances or the risk of disturbances, where, in particular, these result from a significant rise of prices in the Union, provided that this objective cannot be reached by means of other measures available under that Regulation. Given the current market circumstances, Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 does not provide for any specific measures aimed at limiting the high sugar price trend and allowing sugar supply at reasonable prices on the Union market, other than those based on Article 186 of that Regulation.\n\n((6)) Article 64(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 empowers the Commission to fix the surplus levy on sugar and isoglucose produced in excess of the quota at a sufficiently high level in order to avoid the accumulation of surplus quantities.

Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82, (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1138/98 (4), introduced annual quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China listed in Annex II to that Regulation; whereas the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas;
Whereas the Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96 (6), laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas these provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation;
Whereas certain characteristics of China's economy, the seasonal nature of some of the products and the time needed for transport mean that orders for products subject to quota are generally placed before the beginning of the quota year; whereas it is therefore important to ensure that administrative constraints do not impede the realization of the planned imports; whereas in order not to affect the continuity of trade flows, the arrangements for allocating and administering the 1999 quotas should accordingly be adopted before the start of the quota year;
Whereas after examination of the different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94, the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted; whereas under this method the quotas are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants;
Whereas this has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows;
Whereas, however, the introduction of a Community system must ensure progressive access by non-traditional importers; whereas in the light of all these factors a balance must therefore be sought in determining the portions to be allocated to the two categories of importers; whereas, to this end, it is appropriate that the portion set aside for non-traditional importers should be increased as compared to 1998;
Whereas the reference period used for allocating the portion of the quota set aside for traditional importers in earlier Regulations on the administration of these quotas should be updated to ensure open access to the quotas; whereas in order to allow a greater flexibility to the benefit of traditional importers it is considered appropriate to allow them to set their reference period as either 1996 or 1997, which are the most recent years representative of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question; whereas traditional importers must therefore prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the year 1996 or 1997;
Whereas it has been found in the past that the method provided for in Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, which is based on the order in which applications are received, may not be an appropriate way of allocating that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers; whereas, consequently, in accordance with Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, it is appropriate to provide for allocation in proportion to the quantities requested, on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged, in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94;
Whereas in order to ensure that the quotas can be efficiently allocated and used, any speculative applications should be excluded, and it is furthermore necessary to allocate economically significant quantities; whereas to this end the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume or value;
Whereas for the purposes of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers;
Whereas the Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94; whereas the information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question;
Whereas in view of the special nature of transactions concerning products subject to quota, and in particular the time needed for transport, the import licences should expire on 31 December 1999;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the committee for the administration of quotas set up pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 1555/98 of 17 July 1998 establishing administrative procedures for the 1999 quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation lays down for 1999 specific provisions for the administration of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 519/94.\n\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 shall apply, subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(2) Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 has laid down the general rules for the interpretation of the Combined Nomenclature. Those rules apply also to any other nomenclature which is wholly or partly based on it or which adds any additional subdivision to it and which is established by specific provisions of the Union, with a view to the application of tariff and other measures relating to trade in goods.
(3) Pursuant to those general rules, the goods described in column (1) of the table set out in the Annex should be classified under the CN code indicated in column (2), by virtue of the reasons set out in column (3) of that table.

of 29 April 1999
on the registration and operation within the Community of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified and recertificated as meeting the standards of volume I, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, third edition (July 1993)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 84(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 189c of the Treaty(3),
(1) Whereas one of the key objectives of the common transport policy is sustainable mobility; whereas such a policy can be defined as a global approach which aims at ensuring both the effective functioning of the Community's transport systems and the protection of the environment; whereas it is appropriate to take technical measures which contribute to the achievement of sustainable mobility;
(2) Whereas the Commission communication on the future development of the common transport policy: a global framework to the construction of a Community framework for sustainable mobility explicitly refers to the introduction of a non-addition rule for the noisiest aeroplanes;
(3) Whereas the fifth action programme of 1992 on the environment, the general approach of which was endorsed by the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, in their resolution of 1 February 1993(4) envisages further legislative measures aimed at reducing noise emissions from aeroplanes; whereas the said programme lays down the objective that no person should be exposed to noise levels which endanger health and quality of life;
(4) Whereas the growth in air transport activities at Community airports is increasingly subject to environmental constraints; whereas the operation of less noisy aeroplanes at these airports can contribute to a better use of available airport capacity;
(5) Whereas older types of aeroplanes modified to improve their noise certification level have a noise performance which is significantly worse, mass for mass, than that of modern types of aeroplanes originally certificated to meet the standards of Volume I, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, third edition (July 1993); whereas such modifications prolong the life of an aeroplane that would normally have been retired; whereas such modifications tend to worsen the gaseous emissions performance and fuel burn of earlier technology aero engines; whereas aeroplanes may be re-engined to achieve a noise performance comparable to that of those originally certificated to meet Chapter 3 requirements;
(6) Whereas a rule which prohibits the addition of those older modified types of aeroplanes to Member States' registers as from 1 April 1999 can be considered as a protective measure aimed at preventing a deterioration of the noise situation around Community airports as well as improving the situation regarding fuel burn and gaseous emissions;
(7) Whereas in a Community without internal frontiers it is appropriate to exclude from this non-addition rule aeroplanes entered in any Member State's register prior to 1 April 1999;
(8) Whereas, in view of existing Community legislation on aeroplane noise, the present initiative needs to be taken at Community level by binding Community rules;
(9) Whereas a non-addition rule, and a non-operation rule with an appropriate transition period, combines technical feasibility with environmental benefits without imposing an undue economic burden;
(10) Whereas it is necessary to minimise possible distortions of competition by establishing equivalent requirements applicable to aeroplanes registered in third countries; whereas, since the Community has no competence over third-country registers, that objective can be achieved only by restricting the operation of non-complying aeroplanes registered as from 1 April 1999 in third countries; whereas the date for introducing such restrictions should take account of the final cut-off date for the operation of Chapter 2 aeroplanes as provided for in Council Directive 92/14/EEC of 2 March 1992 on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Volume I, Part II, Chapter 2 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition 1998(5), as well as the extent of the non-addition provisions for Chapter 2 aeroplanes as laid down in Council Directive 89/629/EEC of 4 December 1989 on the limitation of noise emission from civil subsonic jet aeroplanes(6);
(11) Whereas, in order to ensure equal treatment of aeroplanes regardless of their country of registration, non-complying aeroplanes in the registers of Member States should also be stopped from operating in accordance with the terms imposed on non-complying aeroplanes in the registers of third countries;
(12) Whereas, given that the main objective of the measure is to limit noise at Community airports, aeroplanes may be exempted from the non-addition and non-operation rules when they are not operated in the Community territory; whereas, in order for these rules to produce their full environmental benefits, temporary exemptions may be possible only for operations of an exceptional nature;
(13) Whereas the provisions of this Regulation shall not be implemented in the overseas departments referred to in Article 227(2) of the Treaty, in view of their geographical location;
(14) Whereas it is necessary to gather information concerning the exemptions granted by the Member States;
(15) Whereas arrangements for greater cooperation over the use of Gibraltar airport were agreed in London on 2 December 1987 by the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom in a joint declaration by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the two countries; whereas such arrangements have yet to come into operation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 925/1999 of 29 April 1999 on the registration and operation within the Community of certain types of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified and recertificated as meeting the standards of volume I, Part II, Chapter 3 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, third edition (July 1993)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nObjective\n\nThe objective of this Regulation is to lay down rules to prevent deteriorations in the overall noise impact in the Community of recertificated civil subsonic jet aeroplanes while at the same time limiting other environmental damage.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n\n(1) ""civil subsonic jet aeroplane"" shall mean a civil subsonic jet aeroplane with a maximum certificated take off mass of 34000 kg or more, or with a certified maximum internal accomodation for the aeroplane type in question consisting of more than 19 passenger seats, excluding any seats for crew only, and powered by engines with a by-pass ratio of less than three;\n\n(2) ""recertificated civil subsonic jet aeroplane"" shall mean a civil subsonic jet aeroplane initially certificated to Chapter 2 or equivalent standards, or initially not noise-certificated which has been modified to meet Chapter 3 standards either directly through technical measures or indirectly through operational restrictions; civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which initially could only be dual-certificated to the standards of Chapter 3 by means of weight restrictions, have to be considered as recertificated aeroplanes; civil subsonic jet aeroplanes which have been modified to meet Chapter 3 standards by being completely re-enginged with engines having a by-pass ratio of three or more are not to be considered as recertificated aeroplanes;\n\n(3) ""Chapter 2"" and ""Chapter 3"" shall mean the noise standards as defined in Volume I, Part II, Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 respectively of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, third edition (July 1993);\n\n(4) ""operational restrictions"" shall mean weight restrictions imposed on the aeroplane and/or operational limitations within the control of the pilot or the operator, such as reduced flap setting;\n\n(5) ""registration of an aeroplane"" shall mean the formal act whereby the nationality of an aeroplane is established through its entry on the national register of a Member State or a third country;\n\n(6) ""the territory of the Community"" shall mean the territory of the Community subject to the provisions of the Treaty.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nNon-complying aeroplanes\n\n1.

In accordance with the ILO standards adopted by the 13th and 14th International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), for the purposes of the Community labour force sample survey, unemployed persons comprise persons aged 15 to 74 who were:\n\n(a) without work during the reference week, i.e. neither had a job nor were at work (for one hour or more) in paid employment or self-employment;\n\n(b) currently available for work, i.e. were available for paid employment or self-employment before the end of the two weeks following the reference week;\n\n(c) actively seeking work, i.e. had taken specific steps in the four week period ending with the reference week to seek paid employment or self-employment or who found a job to start later, i.e. within a period of at most three months.\n\nFor the purposes of point 1(c), the following are considered as specific steps:\n\n- having been in contact with a public employment office to find work, whoever took the initiative (renewing registration for administrative reasons only is not an active step),\n\n- having been in contact with a private agency (temporary work agency, firm specialising in recruitment, etc.) to find work,\n\n- applying to employers directly,\n\n- asking among friends, relatives, unions, etc., to find work,\n\n- placing or answering job advertisements,\n\n- studying job advertisements,\n\n- taking a recruitment test or examination or being interviewed,\n\n- looking for land, premises or equipment,\n\n- applying for permits, licences or financial resources.\n\n2. Education and training are considered as ways of improving employability but not as methods of seeking work. Persons without work and in education or training will only be classified as unemployed if they are ""currently available for work"" and ""seeking work"", as defined in points 1(b) and (c).\n\n3. Lay-offs are classified as unemployed if they do not receive any significant wage or salary (significant is set at &gt;=50 %) from their employer and if they are ""currently available for work"" and ""seeking work"". Lay-offs are treated as a case of unpaid leave initiated by the employer - including leave paid out of government budget or by funds (16th ICLS). In this case, lay-offs are classified as employed if they have an agreed date of return to work and if this date falls within a period of three months.\n\n4. During the off-season, seasonal workers cannot be considered as having a formal attachment to their high-season job - because they do not continue to receive a wage or salary from their employer although they may have an assurance of return to work. If they are not at work during the off-season, they are classified as unemployed only if they are ""currently available for work"" and ""seeking work"", as defined in points 1(b) and (c).'}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nLabour force survey: principles for the formulation of the questions on the labour status\n\n1. The questions on the labour status according to the ILO definition (employed, unemployed or inactive) are in general the first questions in the individual questionnaire, immediately following the questions on the demographic characteristics of the household members. In particular, they are not preceded by questions on the main or the usual activity (student, housekeeping, retired, etc.) or on the administrative status of a registration at the public employment office to claim unemployment benefits, where this would prejudice the response to the questions on the ILO labour status.\n\nIn the case of dependent interviewing in later waves and when the labour status as an employed or inactive person is apparently permanent or stable, their labour status can be shortly verified with reference to their status in the previous wave.\n\n2. The sequence of the questions on employment consists of at least two separate questions: one question on currently working and another question on having a job when being temporarily absent from work (persons on leave). The question on being at work must precede the question on having a job so that the contrast between both questions contributes to a complete identification of the temporarily absent.\n\nThe identification of lay-offs (unpaid leave initiatied by the employer) and their classification as employed (or unemployed) persons depends on two conditions of a formal job attachment: an assurance of return to work after the end of the contingency and the short duration (&lt;=3 months) of the suspension of the labour contract. Both conditions are determined by a question following the question about the reason for their temporary absence or the season why they did not look for a job in the previous four weeks or by response categories in these questions.\n\n3. The questions on employment and job search must contain a cue for the identification of persons with a minor job of just a few or even one hour.\n\n4. The questions on employment must contain a cue for the identification of unpaid family workers. Alternatively, they are identified by a separate question about being at work.\n\n5. The questions on employment must clearly indicate that only work for pay or profit is considered as an economic activity within the ILO framework.\n\n6. The reference period of employment must be clearly specified. The question on employment refers as a rule to the last week, defined as ""from Monday to Sunday"", giving the exact date. The reference periods of job search and availability must be clearly specified. The two questions on job search and job search methods refer to the past four weeks including the reference week and the question on availability to the period until the end of the two weeks following the reference week.\n\n7. All persons who were asked the questions on employment and were identified as having no job are asked the question on job search. No other filter question precedes this question. In the case of dependent interviewing in later waves and when the labour status as an employed or inactive person is apparently permanent or stable, their labour status can be shortly verified with reference to their status in the previous wave.\n\n8. The question on job search must refer to any effort, even irregular, by the respondent to find a job or to establish her/his own business. The wording of the question must avoid that only a continuous search throughout the entire reference period is considered as a sufficient condition of job search.\n\n9. The question on job search methods must contain active and passive search methods. The following are considered as active search methods:\n\n- having been in contact with the public employment office to find work,\n\n- having been in contact with a private agency to find work,\n\n- applying to employers directly,\n\n- asking among friends, relatives, trade unions, etc., to find work,\n\n- placing or answering job advertisements,\n\n- studying job advertisements,\n\n- taking a recruitment test or examination or being interviewed,\n\n- looking for land, premises or equipment,\n\n- applying for permits, licenses of financial resources.\n\n10. The ""contact with the public employment office to find work"" is a two-way contact. It can be initiated by the registered unemployed person or by the employment office. This contact must be included as the first (response category in the) question on job search methods. It is distinct from the administrative renewal of a registration to claim unemployment benefits (when this was not preceded by a spell of employment or inactivity). It is also distinct from the assistance provided by the employment office to improve the employability of the registered unemployed person. The ""contact with the public employment office to find work"" as an active step only involves:\n\n- putting the respondent\'s name in the employment office file for the first time (after a spell of employment or inactivity),\n\n- finding out about possible job vacancies, or\n\n- ""at the initiative of the employment office a suggestion of a job opportunity"", which may be accepted or refused by the job searcher.\n\n11. Job search methods are enumerated until at least three active methods have been mentioned.\n\n12. Persons who are currently not employed and who are not looking for a job because they have already found a job which will start later, i.e. within a period of at most three months must be identified as a separate category.'}]}"

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 3 December 1986
on a proposal by the Belgian Government to grant aid for investments by a flat-glass producer at Moustier
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(87/195/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice in accordance with the above Article to interested parties to submit their comments, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
The Belgian Law of 17 July 1959 introducing and coordinating measures to encourage economic expansion and the creation of new industries and the royal decree of 17 August 1959 (1) implementing it introduced general measures to assist the Belgian economy in the form, inter alia, of interest rebates on loans raised to pay for investments, government guarantees covering loans contracted by enterprises with banks giving entitlement to a rebate, and exemption for five years from land tax.
When it examined the Law in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 93 (1) and (2) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission found that it constituted a general aid scheme as it contained no sectoral or regional objectives. Since the scheme applied to all investments, making no distinction between enterprises, regions or sectors, it could not qualify for application of any of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) or (c) of the EEC Treaty. Without such detailed information, the Commission was unable to assess the scheme's effects on trade between Member States and on competition, or, more especially, its compatibility with the common market.
The Commission has decided to authorize such general aid schemes where one or other of the following two conditions is met: either the Member State concerned notifies to the Commission a plan for regional or sectoral application, or alternatively, where this is not considered feasible, it notifies significant individual awards.
Under Commission Decision 75/397/EEC (2), the Belgian Government is required to notify the Commission, giving it time to state its views in advance, of all significant individual awards under the Law of 17 July 1959, so that the Commission may decide whether they are compatible with the common market.
II
By letter dated 15 November 1985, the Belgian Government informed the Commission, in accordance with that procedure, of its intention to grant, under the Law of 17 July 1959, aid towards investments by a flat-glass producer at Moustier in the province of Namur.
The investments, which total Bfrs 1 201 725 000, relate to the renovation of one of the two float-glass production lines and the modernization of the other, thereby improving energy use and working conditions without increasing optimum capacity. They would make it possible to produce tinted glass and pyrolytically coated glass besides clear glass.
The proposed aid would take the form of an interest subsidy of four percentage points for six years on Bfrs 531,6 million, a capital grant of 4 % for six years on Bfrs 269,55 million and exemption from land tax for six years on the whole investment, representing a net grant equivalent of 5,8 %. In justification of its proposal, the Belgium Government pointed to the diversification into new high-technology products with the help of the investments in question, which would lead in turn to an increase in exports to third countries, the potential energy savings and the favourable impact on other businesses in the area, in particular those in the neighbouring steel area of Charleroi.
III
After an initial scrutiny of the notification, the Commission concluded that the aid proposals could not be considered compatible with the common market on the ground that they would distort competition and affect trade between Member States to an extent contrary to the common interest, owing notably to the vulnerability of the flat-glass sector and the Commission's view that the
renovation of a float line is in principle a replacement investment. As the exceptions provided for in Article 92 of the Treaty did not seem to be applicable, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) and, by letter dated 13 January 1986, gave notice to the Belgian Government to submit its observations.
The Belgian Government submitted its observations under the procedure by letter dated 13 June 1986. It stressed the research and diversification drive undertaken by the firm, to a large extent at the instigation and with the encouragement of the authroities. The firm would not have made its expenditure on research, development and pre-production since 1979 had it not been able to count on economic expansion aid for the subsequent stage of production and adaptation of the existing plant. There was in Europe no significant competition in the recipient firm's new products, and the Commission's assessment of the utilization of production capacity in the flat-glass sector was false. The assertion that the renovation of a float line was a mere replacement and modernization investment was likewise false.
In the context of the consultation of other interested parties, the Governments of two Member States, an industry federation, a manufacturing group in the same sector and the recipient firm submitted observations.
IV
The interest subsidy, the capital grant and the exemption from land tax proposed by the Belgian Government constitute aids within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty because they would enable the recipient firm to be relieved, by means of State resources, of part of the cost of the investment which it would normally have to bear.
According to the information in the Commission's possession, there were in the Community of Ten at the end of 1985 25 flat-glass float lines and six drawn flat-glass production plants, plus another three float lines and two drawn glass plants in Spain and Portugal.
For its part, Belgium has four float lines and one drawn glass plant.
The two float lines belonging to the Belgian producer concerned have a joint effective capacity of 446 000 tonnes a year, or approximately 8 % of installed capacity in the Community and approximately half of Belgian basic flat-glass production.
Flat glass is traded between Member States and there is competition between the various producers. The Belgian producer in question exports about 50 % of its production to the other Member States and 20 % to non-member countries, the remainder being sold or processed in the Benelux. Exports of flat glass (SITC 66440) from the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union to the other Member States amounted to 413 000 tonnes in 1982, 447 000 tonnes in 1983, 481 000 tonnes in 1984 and 434 000 tonnes in 1985, and the corresponding imports to 126 000 tonnes in 1982, 114 000 tonnes in 1983, 92 000 tonnes in 1984 and 109 000 tonnes in 1985. In this context it should be noted that Luxembourg has one float line.
The basic flat-glass industry has been in difficulties owing to stagnant demand and underutilization of capacity, and these have had an adverse effect on company finances and led to job cuts and plant closures. The Groupement EuropĂŠen des Producteurs de Verre Plat (GEPVP) estimates that unused capacity in the Community of Ten amounted to some 590 000 tonnes in 1982, 500 000 tonnes in 1983, 400 000 tonnes in 1984 and 480 000 tonnes in 1985, or 16 %, 13 %, 10 % and 12 %, respectively, of net saleable glass capacity. For these reasons, by Decision 84/497/EEC (1), the Commission found that aid proposed by the Netherlands Government for the setting-up of a new flat-glass production plant in the Netherlands was incompatible with the common market and should therefore not be granted.
Consequently, the aid proposed by the Belgian Government would affect trade between Member States and distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty by favouring both the firm concerned and Belgian flat-glass production.
Where financial assistance from the State strengthens the position of certain enterprises compared with that of others competing with them in the Community, it must be deemed to affect those other enterprises.
Article 92 (1) provides that, in principle, any aid fulfilling the criteria set out therein is incompatible with the common market.
The exceptions to this principle set out in Article 92 (2) of the Treaty are inapplicable in this case in view of the nature and objectives of the proposed aid.
Article 92 (3) of the Treaty lists those aids which may be considered compatible with the common market. Compatibility with the Treaty must be viewed in the context of the Community as a whole and not in that of a single Member State. In order to ensure the proper functioning
of the common market and to take into account the principles laid down in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions to the principle of Article 92 (1) set out in paragraph 3 of that Article must be interpreted strictly when any aid scheme or any individual aid award is examined.
In particular, they may be applied only where the Commission establishes that, without the aid, the free play of market forces would not by itself induce potential recipients to act in such a manner as to contribute to the attainment of one of the objectives sought.
To apply the exceptions to cases which do not contribute to the attainment of such an objective, or where the aid is not essential to that end, would be tantamount to granting undue advantages to the industries or firms of certain Member States, the financial position of which would be bolstered, and might affect trade between Member States and distort competition without this being justified in any way by the common interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3).
In view of the above, the proposed aid does not fall within any of the categories of exception provided for in Article 92 (3).
As to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) concerning aid to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, it should be noted that the standard of living in no part of Belgium is abnormally low and that there is no serious underemployment there within the meaning of the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (a); as far as the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) is concerned, the Moustier area in the province of Namur where the plants in question are located has not been included among those requiring special regional aid by virtue of the Commission's Decision 82/740/EEC (1) concerning the delimitation of development areas in Belgium.
As to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), it is clear that the aid is intended neither to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest nor to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy.
As to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) in favour of aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, the periodic renovation of a float line, which must be carried out every six to nine years must - in principle - be considered a replacement investment, the cost of which is an element of the operating costs. It is perfectly normal and in the interests of the producer itself that it should use the most modern and economic techniques and materials in order to reduce its running costs, including energy consumption. Consequently, aid for the periodic renovation of a float line does not satisfy the requirements of the development of the sector concerned without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest within the meaning of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 92. For these reasons, by Decision 86/593/EEC (2), the Commission found that aid which the Belgian Government was planning to grant for the renovation of two other float lines in Belgium, involving improved energy use and incorporating technical developments without any increase in optimum capacity, was incompatible with the common market and should therefore not be granted.
The information furnished by the Belgian Government and the recipient firm under the procedure concerning the technical innovations included in the investment at issue was examined by the Commission with particular care. According to the Belgian Government, these elements cost Bfrs 672 million, or 56 % of the total investment. The Commission also took note of the fact that the recipient firm is the first glassmaker in Europe to produce glass with energy-saving coatings directly on floats.
It should be noted in this connection that coated glass can be made using two different processes, either by vacuum deposit in processing units or by pyrolysis on flat-glass production lines. The two processes result in products whose composition differs but whose uses are partly the same, namely insulation in buildings. In view of the undoubted surplus capacity in the coated and tempered glass field, the Commission determined by Decision 84/507/EEC (3), that aid which the Luxembourg Government was proposing to grant for the establishment of a flat-glass coating and tempering plant was incompatible with the common market and should therefore not be granted.
The GEPVP, while it considers that aid for repairing existing basic flat-glass plants is justifiable - a view not shared by the Commission - expressed opposition in 1985 to the award of any investment aid in the field of the processing of flat glass intended for use in the motor and construction industries.
Under these circumstances, the aid in question would affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, even if the investment included technological innovations.
Consequently, the Belgian Government's proposed aid does not satisfy the conditions necessary for the application of one of the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '87/195/EEC: Commission Decision of 3 December 1986 on a proposal by the Belgian Government to grant aid for investments by a flat-glass producer at Moustier (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (1) provides that, in principle, any aid fulfilling the criteria set out therein is incompatible with the common market.', 'text': 'Article 92 (1) provides that, in principle, any aid fulfilling the criteria set out therein is incompatible with the common market.\n\nThe exceptions to this principle set out in Article 92 (2) of the Treaty are inapplicable in this case in view of the nature and objectives of the proposed aid.'}, {'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (3) of the Treaty lists those aids which may be considered compatible with the common market.

In order to ensure the proper functioning\n\nof the common market and to take into account the principles laid down in Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions to the principle of Article 92 (1) set out in paragraph 3 of that Article must be interpreted strictly when any aid scheme or any individual aid award is examined.\n\nIn particular, they may be applied only where the Commission establishes that, without the aid, the free play of market forces would not by itself induce potential recipients to act in such a manner as to contribute to the attainment of one of the objectives sought.\n\nTo apply the exceptions to cases which do not contribute to the attainment of such an objective, or where the aid is not essential to that end, would be tantamount to granting undue advantages to the industries or firms of certain Member States, the financial position of which would be bolstered, and might affect trade between Member States and distort competition without this being justified in any way by the common interest within the meaning of Article 92 (3).\n\nIn view of the above, the proposed aid does not fall within any of the categories of exception provided for in Article 92 (3).\n\nAs to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) concerning aid to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, it should be noted that the standard of living in no part of Belgium is abnormally low and that there is no serious underemployment there within the meaning of the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (a); as far as the exception in Article 92 (3) (c) is concerned, the Moustier area in the province of Namur where the plants in question are located has not been included among those requiring special regional aid by virtue of the Commission's Decision 82/740/EEC (1) concerning the delimitation of development areas in Belgium.\n\nAs to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), it is clear that the aid is intended neither to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest nor to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy.\n\nAs to the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) in favour of aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities, the periodic renovation of a float line, which must be carried out every six to nine years must - in principle - be considered a replacement investment, the cost of which is an element of the operating costs. It is perfectly normal and in the interests of the producer itself that it should use the most modern and economic techniques and materials in order to reduce its running costs, including energy consumption. Consequently, aid for the periodic renovation of a float line does not satisfy the requirements of the development of the sector concerned without adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest within the meaning of paragraph 3 (c) of Article 92. For these reasons, by Decision 86/593/EEC (2), the Commission found that aid which the Belgian Government was planning to grant for the renovation of two other float lines in Belgium, involving improved energy use and incorporating technical developments without any increase in optimum capacity, was incompatible with the common market and should therefore not be granted.\n\nThe information furnished by the Belgian Government and the recipient firm under the procedure concerning the technical innovations included in the investment at issue was examined by the Commission with particular care. According to the Belgian Government, these elements cost Bfrs 672 million, or 56 % of the total investment. The Commission also took note of the fact that the recipient firm is the first glassmaker in Europe to produce glass with energy-saving coatings directly on floats.\n\nIt should be noted in this connection that coated glass can be made using two different processes, either by vacuum deposit in processing units or by pyrolysis on flat-glass production lines. The two processes result in products whose composition differs but whose uses are partly the same, namely insulation in buildings. In view of the undoubted surplus capacity in the coated and tempered glass field, the Commission determined by Decision 84/507/EEC (3), that aid which the Luxembourg Government was proposing to grant for the establishment of a flat-glass coating and tempering plant was incompatible with the common market and should therefore not be granted.\n\nThe GEPVP, while it considers that aid for repairing existing basic flat-glass plants is justifiable - a view not shared by the Commission - expressed opposition in 1985 to the award of any investment aid in the field of the processing of flat glass intended for use in the motor and construction industries.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the aid in question would affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest, even if the investment included technological innovations.\n\nConsequently, the Belgian Government's proposed aid does not satisfy the conditions necessary for the application of one of the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:""}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Belgian Government shall refrain from implementing its proposal, notified to the Commission by letter dated 15 November 1985 to grant aid under the Law of 17 July 1959 towards investments effected at Moustier by a flat-glass producer.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Belgian Government shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures it has taken to comply therewith.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 3 December 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPeter SUTHERLAND\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) Moniteur belge/Belgisch Staatsblad, 29. 8. 1959.\n\n(2) OJ No L 177, 8. 7. 1975, p. 13.\n\n(1) OJ No L 276, 19. 10. 1984, p. 37.\n\n(1) OJ No L 312, 9. 11. 1982, p. 18.\n\n(2) OJ No L 342, 5. 12. 1986, p. 32.\n\n(3) OJ No L 283, 27. 10. 1984, p. 39.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed, amending European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and repealing Council Directive 79/373/EEC, Commission Directive 80/511/EEC, Council Directives 82/471/EEC, 83/228/EEC, 93/74/EEC, 93/113/EC and 96/25/EC and Commission Decision 2004/217/EC (1), and in particular Article 10(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, several applications for authorisation were submitted to the Commission before 1 September 2010 for updating the list of intended uses as referred to in Article 10 of that Regulation.
(2) Some of those applications concern changes of the conditions associated with the particular nutritional purposes ‘Nutritional restoration, convalescence’ as regards dogs and ‘Stabilisation of physiological digestion’ in respect of feed that may contain additives in concentrations higher than 100 times the relevant fixed maximum content in complete feed as referred to in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009. The other applications concern new particular nutritional purposes with respect to the requirement established in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009.
(3) In addition, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, the Commission received an application to add the particular nutritional purpose ‘Reduction of iodine levels in feed in case of hyperthyroidism’ as regards cats.
(4) A specific way of feeding is the administration of a bolus. In order to guarantee an appropriate and safe use of a bolus as feed for particular nutritional purposes, general requirements should be established for the conditions associated with certain intended uses.
(5) The Commission made all applications, including the dossiers, available to the Member States.
(6) The dossiers included in the applications demonstrate that the specific composition of the respective feeds fulfil the particular intended nutritional purposes ‘Nutritional restoration, convalescence‘ as regards dogs, ‘Stabilisation of physiological digestion’‘Reduction of iodine levels in feed in case of hyperthyroidism’ as regards cats, ‘Support the preparation for and recovery from sport effort’ as regards equidae, ‘Compensation for insufficient iron availability after birth’ as regards suckling piglets and calves, ‘Support the regeneration of hooves, trotters and skin’ as regards horses, ruminants and pigs, ‘Support the preparation for oestrus and reproduction’ as regards mammals and birds and ‘Long-term supply of grazing animals with trace elements and/or vitamins’ as regards ruminants with a functional rumen.
(7) Furthermore, the evaluation showed that the feeds concerned have no adverse effects on animal health, human health, the environment or animal welfare. The evaluation of the dossiers included verification that the characterisation ‘high level of a certain feed additive’ implies an important level of the respective additive which is close to the relevant fixed maximum content in complete feed but not exceeding this content.
(8) The applications are therefore valid and the particular nutritional purposes should be added to the list of intended uses and the conditions associated with the particular nutritional purposes ‘Nutritional restoration, convalescence’ and ‘Stabilisation of physiological digestion’ should be changed.
(9) Directive 2008/38/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications for the feed currently legally placed on the market, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,","{'header': '7.1.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 2/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 5/2014\nof 6 January 2014\namending Directive 2008/38/EC establishing a list of intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009, several applications for authorisation were submitted to the Commission before 1 September 2010 for updating the list of intended uses as referred to in Article 10 of that Regulation.\n\n((2)) Some of those applications concern changes of the conditions associated with the particular nutritional purposes ‘Nutritional restoration, convalescence’ as regards dogs and ‘Stabilisation of physiological digestion’ in respect of feed that may contain additives in concentrations higher than 100 times the relevant fixed maximum content in complete feed as referred to in Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 767/2009.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 798/85 (2), and in particular Articles 14a (4) and 65 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1223/83 of 20 May 1983 on the exchange rates to be applied in agriculture (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1297/85 (4), and in particular Article 4 (3) thereof,
Whereas, under the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, an aid system was introduced for the use of grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in wine-growing zones C III a) and C III b) for the preparation in the United Kingdom and Ireland of certain products, falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff and for the use of concentrated grape musts produced in the Community for the manufacture of certain products marketed in the United Kingdom and in Ireland with instructions for obtaining from them a beverage in imitation of wine;
Whereas the products falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of the abovementioned Regulation are at the moment produced exclusively from concentrated grape must; whereas, at present, aid should therefore be fixed for the use of concentrated grape must alone;
Whereas implementation of the aid system requires administrative arrangements for checking both the origin of the products for which aid is given and the use to which they are put;
Whereas, to ensure that the aid system and the checking arrangements operate properly, operators must be required to submit written applications giving the information necessary to identify the product and enable the operations to be checked;
Whereas, so that the aid system can have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity for which applications may be submitted should be fixed;
Whereas it should also be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the minimum quality characteristics required for use for the purposes indicated in the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79;
Whereas Article 14a (3) of that Regulation sets criteria for fixing the aid amounts; whereas application of these criteria gives the aid amounts fixed below;
Whereas, to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to make the necessary checks, obligations on operators in regard to the keeping of stock records should be laid down in addition to the provisions of Title II of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3203/80 (6);
Whereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas to allow for technical losses the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;
Whereas for technical reasons operators lay in their stocks a long time before manufacturing the marketed products; whereas accordingly arrangements should be made to enable advance payment of the aid to be made to operators, the competent authorities being guaranteed by appropriate security against the risk of incorrect payment; whereas the period within which advance payment is to be made and the procedure for release of the security should be specified;
Whereas, to prevent discrimination between operators and to resolve certain uncertainties as to interpretation that may arise with regard to the representative rates to be applied under Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1054/78 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1382/85 (2), it should be specified that for all operations under this Regulation the representative rate applicable should in all cases be that applying in the wine sector on 1 September 1985;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural species (1), as last amended by Directive 90/654/EEC (2), and in particular Article 15 (2) and (3) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision 75/576/EEC (3), and in particular Article 2 thereof and the corresponding provisions of Commission Decisions 79/92/EEC (4), 82/949/EEC (5), 84/23/EEC (6), 85/59/EEC (7), 85/624/EEC (8), 87/110/EEC (9), 87/118/EEC  (10), 88/94/EEC (11), 89/77/EEC (12) and 89/589/EEC (13) authorizing the Federal Republic of Germany inter alia to restrict the marketing of seed of certain varieties of agricultural plant species,
Having regard to the applications lodged by Germany and Greece,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 15 (1) of Directive 70/457/EEC, seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1988 in at least one of the Member States and which also meets the conditions  laid down in Directive 70/457/EEC is, with effect from 31 December 1990, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to the variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of Directive 70/457/EEC provides that, in the cases set out in Article 15 (3), a Member State may be authorized, upon application, to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the application of Germany concerns varieties of maize with a Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) maturity class index over 350; whereas it is well known that varieties of maize with an FAO maturity class index over 350 are not at present  suitable for cultivation in Germany (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of Directive 70/457/EEC); whereas, therefore, the application of Germany in respect of these varieties should be granted in full;
Whereas the application of Greece concerns early varieties of soya bean; whereas it is also well known that early varieties of soya bean are not at present suitable for cultivation in Greece (Article 15 (3) (c), second case, of Directive 70/457/EEC);  whereas, therefore, the application of Greece in respect of these varieties should be granted in full;
Whereas, however, the system for the grant of authorizations pursuant to Article 15 (2) of the said Directive must be revised, with a view to the completion of the internal market; whereas this revision will affect all derogations granted hitherto, with  effect from 31 December 1992 at the latest;
Whereas by the abovementioned Decisions the Commission has authorized Germany inter alia to prohibit the marketing of seed of certain varieties of oats of the winter type and of certain varieties of maize with an FAO maturity class index over 350,  listed in the then current common catalogues of agricultural plant species;
Whereas experience has shown that it can no longer be maintained that in Germany the value for cultivation and use of certain varieties of oats of the winter type is inferior to other comparable varieties;
Whereas in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge certain varieties of maize which in the past were considered to fall into a FAO maturity class of an index higher than the abovementioned FAO maturity class index can no longer be so  considered;
Whereas the conditions necessitating the grant of such authorizations to Germany in respect of the said varieties of oats of the winter type and maize are therefore no longer satisfied;

amending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 26 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) With the enlargement of the European Union the number of small and medium sized enterprises (SME) using unwrought, not alloyed aluminium for the production of semi-finished and finished industrial goods has significantly increased. Furthermore, the market situation within the European Union has significantly changed due to takeovers of Community industries by global industrial holdings and further concentration of manufacturers of aluminium on the world market. At the same time costs for electricity, an important cost factor in the production of not alloyed aluminium, has dramatically increased and the development of the world economy has led to a shortage of supply of raw aluminium.
(2) These factors have lead to a significant increase in prices for raw aluminium and excluded to a very large extent independent small and medium sized users of not alloyed aluminium from duty free purchases of this product. The payment of customs duties of 6 % for the basic raw material has therefore the effect that the competitiveness of such companies is at risk and creates the danger that a larger number of these companies will not be able to survive.
(3) The elimination of these companies from the Community market would certainly reduce competition for semi-finished aluminium products on this market. In addition such elimination would have negative effects on the employment in the Community especially in some rural areas of the new Member States. The partial suspension of the customs duty for non-alloyed aluminium would therefore improve to a certain extent the competitiveness of the SME and thus improve the competition for semi-finished and finished aluminium products on the Community market.
(4) This situation has to be weighed against the impact of a customs duty suspension on the manufacturing plants of not alloyed aluminium which still exist within the Community and in countries with a preferential tariff arrangement with the European Union. Almost all these plants belong either directly or indirectly to major industrial holdings located outside the European Union. The aluminium produced in these plants and supplied duty free is mainly used for further transformation within companies linked to these holdings. Only a relative small share of duty free non alloyed aluminium is made available to independent SME. Nevertheless taking into account the relative high level of the conventional rate of customs duty of 6 % the autonomous partial suspension of this duty will have an impact on the profitability of the production and the subsequent transformation operations of these companies due to an increased price pressure on the products resulting from transformation as well as on the raw aluminium sold on the open market to independent companies.
(5) In view of this situation it appears therefore appropriate to suspend the autonomous rate of customs duty partially. This will allow the independent SMEs to reduce their costs and to benefit from a significant increase in competitiveness.
(6) This partial suspension of the autonomous customs duty for unwrought, not alloyed aluminium is appropriate to balance the economic interest of the operators concerned.
(7) Taking into account possible future changes in the market situation of unwrought, not alloyed aluminium, a review should be foreseen after three years of the entry into force of this Regulation.
(8) Since the partial suspension should cover all products falling within CN code 7601 10 00 and given the permanent character of the measure, Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (1) should be amended accordingly,","{'header': '9.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 119/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 501/2007\nof 7 May 2007\namending Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) With the enlargement of the European Union the number of small and medium sized enterprises (SME) using unwrought, not alloyed aluminium for the production of semi-finished and finished industrial goods has significantly increased.

(1) Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral disease in poultry and birds and there is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.
(2) Commission Decision 2005/648/EC of 8 September 2005 concerning protection measures in relation to Newcastle disease in Bulgaria (3) was adopted following an outbreak of Newcastle disease in the administrative district of Vratsa. That Decision suspends the importation of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game and hatching eggs, fresh meat and meat preparations and meat products from these species.
(3) Bulgaria confirmed outbreaks of Newcastle disease in one municipality of the administrative district of Dobrich and in one municipality of the administrative district of Razgrad in Bulgaria.
(4) Taking account of the current epidemiology situation in Bulgaria in relation to Newcastle disease and the fact that this country has applied certain disease control measures and has sent further information on the disease situation to the Commission, it appears that the situation in Bulgaria, except for the districts of Vratsa, Blagoevgrad, Kardzhali, Burgas (excluding the municipalities of Burgas and Sungurlare), for the municipality of Dobrichka situated in the district of Dobrich and for the municipality of Kubrat situated in the district of Razgrad is still satisfactory.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 5 October 2006
on the establishment of a mutual information mechanism concerning Member States' measures in the areas of asylum and immigration
(2006/688/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 66 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) On 4 November 2004 the European Council endorsed a multi-annual programme, known as the Hague Programme, for strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice, which calls for the development of the second phase of a common policy in the field of asylum, migration, visas and borders, which started on 1 May 2004, based, inter alia, on closer practical cooperation between Member States and an improved exchange of information.
(2) The development of common asylum and immigration policies since the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam has resulted in closer interdependency between Member States' policies in these areas, making the need for a more coordinated approach of national policies essential for strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice.
(3) In conclusions adopted at its meeting of 14 April 2005, the Justice and Home Affairs Council called for the establishment of a system of mutual information between those in charge of migration and asylum policy in the Member States, based on the necessity to communicate information on measures considered likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole and allowing for an exchange of views between Member States and the Commission at the request of any one of the Member States or the Commission.
(4) The information mechanism should be based on solidarity, transparency and mutual confidence and should provide a flexible, rapid and non-bureaucratic channel for exchanging information and views on national asylum and immigration measures at European Union level.
(5) For the purposes of the application of this Decision, national asylum and immigration measures which are likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole may comprise policy intentions, long-term programming, draft and adopted legislation, final decisions of the highest courts or tribunals which apply or interpret measures of national law and administrative decisions affecting a significant number of persons.
(6) Communication of the relevant information should take place at the latest when the measures concerned become publicly available. Member States are however encouraged to transmit it as soon as possible.
(7) For reasons of efficiency and accessibility, a web-based network should be an essential element of the information mechanism concerning national measures in the areas of asylum and immigration.
(8) The exchange of information on national measures through a web-based network should be complemented by the possibility of exchanging views on such measures.
(9) The information mechanism established by this Decision should be without prejudice to the right of Member States to request ad-hoc discussions in the Council on national measures at any time, in accordance with the Council's rules of procedure.
(10) Since the objectives of this Decision, namely secure information exchange and consultation between Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the effects of this Decision, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiary as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(11) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Decision does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.\n\n((11)) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.\n\n((12)) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter and scope', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision establishes a mechanism for the mutual exchange of information concerning national measures in the areas of asylum and immigration that are likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The mechanism referred to in paragraph 1 allows for the preparation of exchanges of views and debates on such measures.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Information to be submitted', 'text': 'Article 2\nInformation to be submitted\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall communicate to the Commission and the other Member States information on the measures which they intend to take, or have recently taken, in the areas of asylum and immigration, where these measures are publicly available and are likely to have a significant impact on several Member States or on the European Union as a whole.\nSuch information shall be transmitted as soon as possible and at the latest when it becomes publicly available.

COUNCIL DECISION No 448/2011/EU
of 19 July 2011
amending Decision 2004/162/EC as regards the products that may benefit from exemption from or a reduction in dock dues
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 349 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2004/162/EC of 10 February 2004 concerning the dock dues in the French overseas departments and extending the period of validity of Decision 89/688/EEC (2) authorises the French authorities to apply exemptions from or reductions in the dock dues tax for the products listed in the Annex thereto. The maximum permitted tax differential is, depending on the products and the overseas department in question, 10, 20 or 30 percentage points.
(2) In accordance with the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decision 2004/162/EC, on 31 July 2008 the French authorities presented to the Commission a report on the application of the taxation arrangements provided for in that Decision. On 22 December 2008 a supplement was submitted, and the further information requested by the Commission on 15 April 2009 was sent to it on 16 April 2010. The report from the French authorities included a request for the list of products to which differentiated taxation may be applied to be adapted for French Guiana.
(3) On the basis of the report from the French authorities, the Commission presented to the Council the report provided for in the third paragraph of Article 4 of Decision 2004/162/EC and a proposal for amendments to that Decision. The proposals concern either the four DOMs or French Guiana specifically.
(4) It should first be noted that there is no longer any local production of certain products in the DOM concerned, and the French authorities no longer apply differentiated taxation to certain other products because those produced locally are now at a price equivalent to that of products from outside the DOM. Those products should therefore be removed from the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC. This is the case in Guadeloupe for margarine (product 1517 10 (3) and for pebbles, gravel, etc. (product 2517 10). In the case of Martinique the products concerned are anti-freezing preparations and prepared de-icing liquids (product 3820), margarine (product 1517 10) and certain acids (product 2811). Lastly, the products concerned in the case of Réunion are soya-bean oil (product 1507 90), certain olive oils (product 1510 00 90), certain chemical products (products 2828 10 00 and 2828 90 00) and certain photographic materials (product 3705 10 00).
(5) Secondly, the tax differential actually applied is, for a limited number of products, significantly below the maximum authorised. The maximum differential authorised for these products should therefore be reduced as there is no specific reason to believe that an increase in the existing tax differential may become necessary in the near future. For Guadeloupe, the products concerned are certain meats (product 0210), certain vegetables (products 0702, 0705, 0706 10 00, 0707 00, 0709 60 and 0709 90), certain kinds of animal feedstuffs (product 2309), certain paints (products 3208, 3209 and 3210), certain abrasive products (product 6805) and certain glasses for corrective spectacles (product 7015 10 00). For French Guiana, the products concerned are certain kinds of rice (product 1006 20). For Martinique they are certain cereals (product 1008 90 90), certain flours (product 1102) and pebbles, gravel, etc. (product 2517 10).
(6) Thirdly, in certain cases the products manufactured locally do not appear to be less competitive than those coming from outside the DOMs. These concern products currently falling within Part A of the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC where the volume of production in the DOM concerned is high and, although the differential applied is small, no imports of equivalent products have been recorded in the last 3 years analysed. These products should therefore be removed from the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC. For Guadeloupe the products concerned are certain food production residues (product 2302). For Réunion the products concerned are certain residues from the manufacture of wood pulp (product 3804 00).
(7) The amendments relating specifically to French Guiana, namely the addition of new products and an increase in the differential authorised for certain products, are justified in each case by the higher costs of the products manufactured locally compared with equivalent imported products manufactured in the European territory of the Union.
(8) The amendments to be made in this respect for French Guiana consist principally in adding to the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC the products which were already being manufactured locally in 2004 and for which no request for inclusion in the list of products to which differential taxation may be applied was made in 2004.
(9) In the agriculture, fisheries and agri-food industry sectors, the products to be included in the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC are certain meats (products 0201, 0202, 0203, 0204, 0208 and 0210), certain species of fish (products 0304 and 0305), certain meat preparations (products 1601 and 1602), certain sugar products (product 1702), certain breads, cakes or pastries (product 1905), certain preserved vegetables or fruit (products 2001 and 2006), jams (product 2007), certain sauces (product 2103), ice cream and other edible ice (product 2105), certain miscellaneous food preparations (product 2106) and certain liqueurs and cordials and rum-based beverages (products 2208 70 and 2208 90).
(10) In the housing and construction sector the products concerned are certain plastic products (products 3919 and 3926), certain articles of cement, concrete or artificial stone, (product 6810 19) and certain iron products (products 7210, 7214 20, 7216, 7217 90 90, 7309, 7310 and 7314).
(11) For products derived from forestry and other miscellaneous products, the products concerned are various woods and joinery products (products 4403 99 95, 4407 22, 4407 99 96, 4409 29 91, 4409 29 99, 4418 (except subheadings 4418 10 50, 4418 20 50, 4418 71, 4418 72 and 4418 79), certain categories of furniture (products 9403 40 10 and 9406 except subheading 9406 00 31), certain printed products (products 4910 and 4911) and certain items of clothing (products 6109, 6205 and 6206).
(12) For some products already included in the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC, still referring to French Guiana, the maximum differential concerned should be extended to cover subheadings of the Combined Nomenclature which they do not currently cover, or the maximum differential should be increased, or both.
(13) Thus all fruit juices (product 2009), all mineral waters containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured (product 2202) and all plastic articles for the conveyance or packaging of goods (product 3923) should be included in list C of products to which a tax differential of 30 percentage points may be applied, while fruit juices of subheading 2009 80, mineral waters of heading 2202 10 and plastic articles for the conveyance or packaging of goods (product 3923), for which a tax differential of 20 percentage points is currently authorised, should be removed from list B.
(14) In the case of cements, in list B (products to which a tax differential of 20 percentage points may be applied) white cement (product 2523 21 00) should be replaced by other Portland cement (product 2523 29). For structures and parts of structures of iron or steel, the authorised tax differential of 20 percentage points should be applied to all products of heading 7308 and not only to those of subheading 7308 90, as at present. For articles of aluminium, the tax differential of 20 percentage points should be applied to all products of heading 7610 and not only to those of subheading 7610 90, as at present. This would mean that this tax differential could also be applied to doors, windows, doorframes and thresholds for doors of heading 7610 10.
(15) Finally, still in the case of French Guiana, three products which are not yet produced locally but for which there are concrete plans to launch production in the near future, should be added to the lists of products to which differentiated taxation may be applied. They are: milk (product 0401), mineral waters (product 2201) and certain articles of stone or other mineral substances (product 6815).
(16) Decision 2004/162/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '23.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 193/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION No 448/2011/EU\nof 19 July 2011\namending Decision 2004/162/EC as regards the products that may benefit from exemption from or a reduction in dock dues', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Decision 2004/162/EC of 10 February 2004 concerning the dock dues in the French overseas departments and extending the period of validity of Decision 89/688/EEC(2)authorises the French authorities to apply exemptions from or reductions in the dock dues tax for the products listed in the Annex thereto.

For Réunion the products concerned are certain residues from the manufacture of wood pulp (product 3804\xa000).\n\n((7)) The amendments relating specifically to French Guiana, namely the addition of new products and an increase in the differential authorised for certain products, are justified in each case by the higher costs of the products manufactured locally compared with equivalent imported products manufactured in the European territory of the Union.\n\n((8)) The amendments to be made in this respect for French Guiana consist principally in adding to the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC the products which were already being manufactured locally in 2004 and for which no request for inclusion in the list of products to which differential taxation may be applied was made in 2004.\n\n((9)) In the agriculture, fisheries and agri-food industry sectors, the products to be included in the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC are certain meats (products 0201, 0202, 0203, 0204, 0208 and 0210), certain species of fish (products 0304 and 0305), certain meat preparations (products 1601 and 1602), certain sugar products (product 1702), certain breads, cakes or pastries (product 1905), certain preserved vegetables or fruit (products 2001 and 2006), jams (product 2007), certain sauces (product 2103), ice cream and other edible ice (product 2105), certain miscellaneous food preparations (product 2106) and certain liqueurs and cordials and rum-based beverages (products 2208\xa070 and 2208\xa090).\n\n((10)) In the housing and construction sector the products concerned are certain plastic products (products 3919 and 3926), certain articles of cement, concrete or artificial stone, (product 6810\xa019) and certain iron products (products 7210, 7214\xa020, 7216, 7217\xa090\xa090, 7309, 7310 and 7314).\n\n((11)) For products derived from forestry and other miscellaneous products, the products concerned are various woods and joinery products (products 4403\xa099\xa095, 4407\xa022, 4407\xa099\xa096, 4409\xa029\xa091, 4409\xa029\xa099, 4418 (except subheadings 4418\xa010\xa050, 4418\xa020\xa050, 4418\xa071, 4418\xa072 and 4418\xa079), certain categories of furniture (products 9403\xa040\xa010 and 9406 except subheading 9406\xa000\xa031), certain printed products (products 4910 and 4911) and certain items of clothing (products 6109, 6205 and 6206).\n\n((12)) For some products already included in the lists in the Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC, still referring to French Guiana, the maximum differential concerned should be extended to cover subheadings of the Combined Nomenclature which they do not currently cover, or the maximum differential should be increased, or both.\n\n((13)) Thus all fruit juices (product 2009), all mineral waters containing added sugar or other sweetening matter or flavoured (product 2202) and all plastic articles for the conveyance or packaging of goods (product 3923) should be included in list C of products to which a tax differential of 30 percentage points may be applied, while fruit juices of subheading 2009\xa080, mineral waters of heading 2202\xa010 and plastic articles for the conveyance or packaging of goods (product 3923), for which a tax differential of 20 percentage points is currently authorised, should be removed from list B.\n\n((14)) In the case of cements, in list B (products to which a tax differential of 20 percentage points may be applied) white cement (product 2523\xa021\xa000) should be replaced by other Portland cement (product 2523\xa029). For structures and parts of structures of iron or steel, the authorised tax differential of 20 percentage points should be applied to all products of heading 7308 and not only to those of subheading 7308\xa090, as at present. For articles of aluminium, the tax differential of 20 percentage points should be applied to all products of heading 7610 and not only to those of subheading 7610\xa090, as at present. This would mean that this tax differential could also be applied to doors, windows, doorframes and thresholds for doors of heading 7610\xa010.\n\n((15)) Finally, still in the case of French Guiana, three products which are not yet produced locally but for which there are concrete plans to launch production in the near future, should be added to the lists of products to which differentiated taxation may be applied. They are: milk (product 0401), mineral waters (product 2201) and certain articles of stone or other mineral substances (product 6815).\n\n((16)) Decision 2004/162/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 February 2012.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nThe Annex to Decision 2004/162/EC is amended as follows:\n(1)\nPart A is amended as follows:\n(a)\nin point 1 the following products are inserted: ‘0210, 0702, 0705, 0706\xa010\xa000, 0707\xa000, 0709\xa060, 0709\xa090, 2309, 6805’, and product ‘2302’ is deleted;\n(b)\nin point 2 the following products are inserted: ‘1006\xa020, 2201’;\n(c)\nin point 3 the following products are inserted: ‘1008\xa090\xa090, 1102, 2517\xa010’, and product ‘2811’ is deleted;\n(d)\nin point 4, the following products are deleted: ‘3705\xa010\xa000, 3804\xa000’;\n(2)\nPart B is amended as follows:\n(a)\nin point 1 the following products are inserted: ‘3208, 3209, 3210, 7015\xa010\xa000’, and the following products are deleted: ‘0210, 0702, 0705, 0706\xa010\xa000, 0707\xa000, 0709\xa060, 0709\xa090, 2309, 6805’;\n(b)\nin point 2 the following products are inserted: ‘0201, 0202, 0203, 0204, 0208, 0210, 0304, 0305, 0401, 1905, 2105, 2523\xa029, 3919, 3926, 4910, 4911, 6109, 6205, 6206, 6810\xa019, 6815, 7210, 7214\xa020, 7216, 7217\xa090\xa090, 7308, 7309, 7310, 7314, 7610’, and the following products are deleted: ‘1006\xa020, 2009\xa080, 2202\xa010, 2523\xa021\xa000, 3923, 7308\xa090, 7610\xa090’;\n(c)\nin point 3 the following products are deleted: ‘1008\xa090\xa090, 1102, 3820 except 3820\xa000\xa000’;\n(d)\nin point 4 the following products are deleted: ‘1507\xa090, 1510\xa000\xa090, 2828\xa010\xa000, 2828\xa090\xa000’;\n(3)\nPart C is amended as follows:\n(a)\nin point 1 the following products are deleted: ‘1517\xa010, 2517\xa010, 3208, 3209, 3210, 7015\xa010\xa000’;\n(b)\nin point 2 the following products are inserted: ‘1601, 1602, 1702, 2001, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2103, 2106, 2202, 2208\xa070\n(\n*1\n)\n, 2208\xa090\n(\n*1\n)\n, 3923, 4403\xa099\xa095, 4407\xa022, 4407\xa099\xa096, 4409\xa029\xa091, 4409\xa029\xa099, 4418 except 4418\xa010\xa050, 4418\xa020\xa050, 4418\xa071, 4418\xa072 and 4418\xa079, 9403\xa040\xa010, 9406 except 9406\xa000\xa031’;\n(c)\nin point 3 the following products are deleted: ‘1517\xa010, 2517\xa010’.\n(\n*1\n)\nOnly rum-based products of heading 2208\xa040.'}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 27 January 1992  terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of audio tapes on reels originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong  (92/62/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries no members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In November 1988 the Commission received a written complaint lodged by the European Council of Chemical Manufacturer's Federation (Cefic) on behalf of producers whose collective output of audio tapes on reels and in cassettes was stated to  constitute a major proportion of Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping of the product concerned originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea (Korea) and Hong Kong and of material injury resulting  therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
The Commission accordingly announced, by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of audio tapes on reels and in cassettes, falling within  CN codes 8523 11 00 and 8523 13 00 and originating in Japan, Korea and Hong Kong and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be conerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and  to request a hearing.
(3) All of the known Korean exporters, most of the Japanese exporters, one Hong Kong expoerter and all complainant Community producers made their views known in writing. Submissions were also made by a number of importers.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
(a) Community producers
AGFA Gevaert AG, Muenchen, Germany,
BASF Aktiengesellschaft, Ludwigshafen, Germany,
SUMA, Gien, France.
These Community producers are all members of Cefic.
(b) Japanese producers/exporters
TDK, Tokyo,
Denon Columbia, Tokyo.
(c) Korean producers/exporters
Saehan Media Co., Seoul,
Sunkyong Magnetic Ltd (SKM), Seoul.
(d) Hong Kong producers/exporters
Swire Magnetics (HK) Ltd.
(e) Importers in the Community
Sony, Bayonne,
TDK Recording Media Europe GmbH, Rammelsbach,
Denon Columbia GmbH, Ratingen,
Sunkyong Europe Ltd, London.
(5) The Commission requested and received detailed written and oral submissions from the Community producers represented by the complainant, from the exporters named and from a number of importers and verified the information provided to the extent  considered necessary.
(6) For the reasons stated in recitals 9 to 12 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3262/90 (1), confirmed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1251/91 (2), it was considered necessary to treat audio tapes in cassettes and on reels as two different products.  Definitive anti-dumping duties have been imposed by the above Council Regulation on imports of audio tapes in cassettes from Japan and Korea. This Commission Decision is only concerned with audio tapes on reels.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(7) In July 1991 the Commission was informed by the complainant that it has decided to withdraw the complaint with regard to audio tapes on reels owing in particular to the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on audio tapes in cassettes (see  recital 6). The complainant stated, however, that it withdrew its petition without prejudice of a future action.
(8) The Commission has no reason to believe that the termination of the proceeding would not be in the interest of the Community and considers that the anti-dumping proceeding should thus be terminated,","{'title': '92/62/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 January 1992 terminating the anti\xaddumping proceeding concerning imports of audio tapes on reels originating in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong'}"

Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Articles 33 and 192 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the progressive dismantling of Spanish tariffs has notably improved access to the hitherto heavily protected Spanish market; whereas, however, the economic impact of the progressive reductions in the customs duties applied by the Community of Ten to imports of Spanish industrial products is relatively modest because of the low level of the basic customs duties;
Whereas, in the interests of parallelism and non-discrimination, identical measures should be applied in respect of Portuguese products for which customs duties have not yet been abolished;

of 25 March 2004
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(2) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(4) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to that Regulation or to assimilated products.
(5) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(6) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice cream and other foodstuffs(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 635/2000(4), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.
(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(5), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(6), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(7), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(8), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(9) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(10) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(11), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(9) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(12), with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(10) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC, Member States must give the Commission advance notification of their derogations, for the first time by 31 December 2002 or up to two years after the last date of application of the amended versions of the Annex to the Directive.
(2) Commission Directive 2003/29/EC (2) amended the Annex to Directive 96/49/EC. Under the terms of Directive 2003/29/EC Member States had to bring into force national legislation no later than 1 July 2003, the last date of application referred to in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC being 30 June 2003.
(3) Certain Member States had notified the Commission by 31 December 2003 of their wish to adopt derogations from Directive 96/49/EC. By Commission Decision 2005/180/EC of 4 March 2005 authorising Member States to adopt certain derogations pursuant to Council Directive 96/49/EC with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail (3), the Commission authorised the adoption by those Member States of the derogations listed in Annexes I and II to that Decision.
(4) Commission Directive 2004/89/EC (4) again amended the Annex to Directive 96/49/EC. Under the terms of Directive 2004/89/EC Member States had to bring into force national legislation at the latest by 1 October 2004, the last date of application referred to in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC being 30 September 2004.
(5) The United Kingdom notified the Commission by 31 December 2004 of its wish to amend its existing derogations in Annex I to Decision 2005/180/EC. The Commission has examined the notifications for compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 6(9) of Directive 96/49/EC and has approved them. That Member State should therefore be authorised to adopt the derogations in question.

Whereas:
(1) The Commission consulted the Economic and Financial Committee before submitting its proposal.
(2) Political changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia have taken place leading to new democratic governments and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is making efforts to establish a well-functioning market economy.
(3) Within the Stabilisation and Association process, constituting the framework for EU relations with the region, it is desirable to support efforts made to ensure a stable political and economic environment in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, with a view to evolving towards the development of a full cooperation relationship with the Community.
(4) The Community provided an emergency assistance package of approximately EUR 200 million comprising food aid and medical and energy supplies to provide for the basic needs of the population during the winter of 2000/01.
(5) Financial assistance from the Community shall be instrumental in bringing the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia closer to the Community.
(6) The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has reached an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a comprehensive set of economic stabilisation and reform measures. The IMF approved a one-year stand-by arrangement on 11 June 2001.
(7) The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has reached an understanding with the World Bank on a set of structural adjustment measures to be backed by Structural Adjustment Loans and Credits in the areas of public finance reform, enterprise privatisation and banking restructuring.
(8) The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have requested financial assistance from the international financial institutions, the Community, and other bilateral donors.
(9) Over and above the estimated financing which could be provided by the IMF and the World Bank, an important residual financing gap remains to be covered in the coming months in order to strengthen the country's reserve position and to support the policy objectives attached to that country's authorities' reform efforts.
(10) The authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have committed themselves to fully discharge all outstanding financial obligations of all public entities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia towards the European Community and the European Investment Bank, and to accept the responsibility by way of guarantee for those obligations that are not yet due.
(11) Community macro-financial assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the form of a combination of a long-term loan and a straight grant is an appropriate measure to help, with other donors, ease the country's external financial constraints, supporting the balance of payments and strengthening the reserve position.
(12) The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is temporarily eligible for highly concessional loans and facilities from the World Bank.
(13) The inclusion of a grant component in this assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.
(14) This macro-financial assistance should be managed by the Commission in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee.

Whereas the Greek Government forwarded a programme for the fisheries sector in Greece on 19 December 1983; whereas it forwarded last additional information concerning that programme on 27 July 1984;
Whereas the said programme envisages further increasing the value of the resources available; whereas it aims to promote the rationalization and modernization of storage, processing and marketing facilities for fishery products as well as the setting up of new units as far as the market allows; whereas it aims at the same time to improve the quality of the finished products and to make it possible for new products to be marketed, thereby increasing the value added to the basic products; whereas it thus constitutes a programme within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77;
Whereas pursuant to Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 projects under the programme must contribute to improving the situation of Community fishermen; whereas such does not appear to be the case for installations principally used for the processing of non-Community products or for cold stores not directly linked with production, processing or marketing facilities for fishery products;
Whereas the examination of projects concerning a development of the sardine processing sector should receive special attention, taking into account the market situation for these products and its development in the near future;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 24 October 2001 the company Laboratoires Pharmascience (now Laboratoires Expanscience) made a request to the competent authorities of France to place ‘rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter’ on the market as a novel food ingredient.
(2) On 8 January 2002 the competent authorities of France forwarded their initial assessment report to the Commission. The report came to the conclusion that ‘rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter’ proposed as a food ingredient at a daily intake of 1,5 g per day would make it possible to supplement vitamin E intake and also concluded that the levels of phytosterol were not sufficient to reduce cholesterolaemia.
(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 18 February 2002.
(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.
(5) The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was therefore consulted on 30 January 2004.
(6) On 6 December 2005, EFSA adopted the ‘Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies on a request from the Commission related to “rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter” as a novel food ingredient’.
(7) The opinion came to the conclusion that the proposed use level of 1,5 g per day of ‘rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter’ was safe.
(8) It is recognised that ‘rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter’ at the intended use level of 1,5 g is a safe source of Vitamin E. For labelling and presentation, Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to food supplements (2) applies.
(9) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that ‘rapeseed oil high in unsaponifiable matter’ complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 133 and 233 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from the countries not members of the European Community(1).
Whereas:
A. EXISTING MEASURES
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 393/98(2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof originating in the People's Republic of China, India, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand falling within CN codes 7318 12 10, 7318 14 10, 7318 15 30, 7318 15 51, 7318 15 61, 7318 15 70 and 7318 16 30.
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE
(2) Following the imposition of these definitive anti-dumping measures, the Indian companies Kundan Industries Limited and Tata International Limited, whose exports were subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 47,4 %, lodged an application for the annulment of Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 393/98 before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities. This application was entered in the Register of the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on 7 June 1998 as Case T-88/98.
(3) By its Judgment of 21 November 2002(3), the Court of First Instance of the European Communities annulled Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 393/98 insofar as it imposes a definitive anti-dumping duty on exports to the Community of stainless steel fasteners and parts thereof manufactured by Kundan Industries Limited and exported by Tata International Limited which exceeds that which would apply but for the adjustment to the export price made in respect of a commission. Since the original duty of 47,4 % was based on a dumping margin which included an adjustment of 2 % in respect of a commission, the anti-dumping duty is therefore annulled to the extent that it exceeds 45,4 %.
(4) Consequently, in accordance with Article 233 of the Treaty, it is appropriate to amend the rate of duty established for Kundan Industries Limited and Tata International Limited in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 393/98 with retroactive effect.

of 25 June 2007
repealing Decision 2005/704/EC accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China
(2007/440/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   EXISTING MEASURES
(1) In October 2005, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China (‘the product concerned’).
(2) The Commission, by Decision 2005/704/EC (3), accepted a price undertaking offered by Yingkou Qinghua Refractories Co. Ltd, (‘the Company’).
B.   BREACHES OF THE UNDERTAKING
1.   The undertaking
(a)   Obligations of the company with regard to the undertaking
(3) In the framework of the undertaking, the Company agreed, inter alia, not to sell the product concerned to the European Community below certain minimum prices (MIPs) laid down in the undertaking.
(4) The terms of the undertaking also oblige the Company to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information in the form of a quarterly report of its sales of the product concerned to the European Community.
(5) For the purpose of ensuring compliance with the undertaking, the Company also undertook to allow on-the-spot verification visits at its premises in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports and to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission.
(b)   Other provisions of the undertaking
(6) In addition, and as stipulated in the undertaking, the acceptance of the undertaking by the European Commission is based on trust and any action which would harm the relationship of trust established with the European Commission shall justify the immediate withdrawal of the undertaking.
(7) Furthermore, and as stipulated in the undertaking, any changes in circumstances occurring during the period of implementation of the undertaking from those circumstances prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking which were relevant to the decision to accept the undertaking may give rise to the withdrawal of the undertaking by the European Commission.
2.   Verification visit to the Company
(8) In this regard, a verification visit was carried out at the premises of the Company in the People's Republic of China.
(9) Two days before the verification visit, the Company submitted revised versions of the undertaking reports for the second and third quarter of 2006. The revisions submitted concerned — inter alia — a prolongation of the terms of payment for five transactions. These adjustments for the time allowed for payment have led to prices below the MIP.
(10) Furthermore, the verification visit established a change in the pattern of trade to the European Community after imposition of anti-dumping measures. During the investigation period of the investigation that led to the imposition of the existing measures, the Company sold to the Community exclusively the product concerned. After imposition of measures the Company started to sell also other products to its clients in the Community.
(11) Such a change in the pattern of trade affects the undertaking insofar as it constitutes a serious risk of cross-compensation, i.e. the product not covered by the undertaking may be sold at artificially low prices in order to compensate the MIP for the product covered by the undertaking.
(12) In order to further assess whether such compensation actually took place, the Company was requested to provide copies of invoices of the product not covered by the undertaking, issued to other clients inside and outside the European Community.
(13) The Company argued that an analysis of prices of other products is not meaningful to identify cross-compensation since the qualities and associated prices of these products may vary from client to client. In order to address those concerns, the Company was asked to provide a price list broken down by different qualities and clients but refused to do so and alleged that it concerned confidential information for products not covered by measures.
(14) Finally, the Company provided copies of five invoices for products not covered by the undertaking, issued in 2005 and 2006. One invoice was issued to a customer buying at the same time the product covered by the undertaking, another invoice concerned a customer inside the Community that did not buy the product concerned from the Company. The remaining invoices were issued to customers outside the Community.
(15) Taking into account the various qualities purchased by these five customers, it was found that the price charged to the customer in the Community, who bought also the product covered by the undertaking, was significantly lower than the price charged for similar qualities to the other client in the Community who did not buy the product covered by the undertaking. A similar price difference applied to the other clients outside the Community. This pricing policy is therefore considered as a clear indication that cross-compensation actually took place.
3.   Reasons to withdraw acceptance of the undertaking
(16) The obligation of the Company to respect the MIP for all sales of the product covered by the undertaking was not met, as described in recital 9 above.
(17) Furthermore, a change in the pattern of trade since the imposition of measures has led to a significant risk of cross-compensation which no longer allows the Commission to effectively monitor the undertaking and therefore renders the undertaking impractical.
(18) It appears that this change in the pattern of trade allowed the Company to compensate customers in the Community for sales subject to the MIP by artificially low prices for the product not covered by the undertaking.
(19) This change in the pattern of trade is considered as a relevant change in circumstances compared to those prevailing at the time of acceptance of the undertaking and should lead, taking into account the findings set out above in recitals 10 to 12, to the withdrawal of the undertaking.
(20) In addition, by withholding the price lists for products not covered by the undertaking, the Company failed to comply with the obligation to provide relevant information in accordance with Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation and the provisions of the undertaking.
(21) Furthermore, the unwillingness of the Company to provide these price lists harmed the relationship of trust which formed the basis for the acceptance of the undertaking.
4.   Written submissions
(a)   Proportionality
(22) With regard to the price violation, the Company admitted that a price violation occurred. The Company argued, however, that the sales prices of all other transactions were strictly in compliance with the MIP. Moreover, it was submitted that the final price was not significantly lower than the MIP. The Company claimed that, on this basis, the withdrawal of the undertaking would be disproportionate to the breaches that occurred.
(23) In response to these arguments, regarding the issue of proportionality, it should be pointed out that in accordance with the undertaking, the Company undertook to ensure that the Net Sales Price of all sales covered by the undertaking shall be at or above the MIPs set out in the undertaking.
(24) Moreover, the basic Regulation contains no direct or indirect requirement that a breach of an undertaking must relate to a minimum percentage of sales or must relate to a minimum percentage of the MIP.
(25) This approach has also been confirmed by the jurisprudence of the Court of First Instance which has ruled that any breach of an undertaking is sufficient to justify the withdrawal of acceptance of an undertaking (4).
(26) Accordingly, the arguments presented by the Company with regard to proportionality do not alter the Commission's view that a breach of the undertaking occurred and that the withdrawal of the undertaking would be proportionate to that breach.
(b)   Change in the pattern of trade
(27) With regard to the change in the pattern of trade, the Company submitted that it did not deliberately change its pattern of trade in order to compensate customers in the Community for sales subject to the MIP by artificially low prices for the product not covered by the undertaking.
(28) It was argued that the price increase caused by the imposition of anti-dumping measures and the consequential decline in sales to the EU of the product concerned has led the Company to develop new products outside the scope of measures in order to maintain trade with the Community.
(29) In response to these arguments, it should be underlined that the change in the pattern of trade as such constitutes a serious risk of cross-compensation, regardless for what reason it occurred. It is standing practice of the Commission not to accept price undertakings if the risk of cross-compensation is high. Consequently, if such a change in the pattern of trade occurs during the period of application of an undertaking, the change in itself is sufficient enough for the Commission to withdraw the undertaking, because it renders a proper monitoring of the undertaking impractical, regardless of whether or not a cross-compensation actually took place.
(30) Accordingly, the arguments presented by the Company in this respect do not alter the Commission's view that the change in the pattern of trade had led to a significant risk of cross-compensation.
(c)   Compensation scheme
(31) The Company further submitted that it is a reasonable strategy and common business practice to offer favourable prices when trying to penetrate a market with a new product and that therefore it cannot be concluded that compensation actually took place, in particular since the volume of sales of the new product were nowhere near enough to fully compensate the loss in sales of the product covered by the undertaking.
(32) In response to this submission, it has to be stressed that a favourable price was only offered to a client buying both the product covered by the undertaking and other products. It was not offered to another client in the EU which does not buy the product covered by the undertaking. Therefore, the very high price charged to the other client in the EU for a similar quality undermines this argumentation and strengthens the argument that cross-compensation actually took place.
(33) Furthermore, as concerns the issue of materiality and proportionality, it should be stressed that there is no requirement on the Commission to demonstrate that a drop in sales of the product concerned has been offset by an equivalent rise in sales of new products when assessing whether cross-compensation has taken place.
(d)   Information to be provided
(34) Additionally, the Company contested having denied providing a price list for products not covered by the undertaking but argued that it does not have a universal price list since different prices apply to different customers in different regions.
(35) In reply to this submission, it has to be recalled that the Company has been asked to provide those price lists that are available in order to overcome that problem, but was unwilling to do so since it was alleged that it concerned confidential information for products not covered by measures.
(36) Accordingly, the arguments presented by the Company in this respect do not alter the Commission's view that the Company failed to comply with the obligation to permit verification of pertinent data in accordance with Article 8(7) of the basic Regulation.
C.   REPEAL OF DECISION 2005/704/EC
(37) In view of the above, the acceptance of the undertaking should be withdrawn and Decision 2005/704/EC should be repealed. Accordingly, the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 on imports of the product concerned from the Company should apply,","{'header': '26.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 164/32', 'title': ""COMMISSION DECISION\nof 25 June 2007\nrepealing Decision 2005/704/EC accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain magnesia bricks originating in the People's Republic of China\n(2007/440/EC)"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2005/704/EC is hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 189c of the Treaty (3),
Whereas Protocol 5 on bananas to the fourth ACP-EC Convention provides that, in respect of its banana exports to the Community markets, no ACP State shall be placed, as regards access to its traditional markets and its advantages on those markets, in a less favourable situation than in the past or at present;
Whereas national market organizations have hitherto granted traditional ACP suppliers of bananas an outlet for their production on their traditional markets and enabled them to obtain from these markets and adequate income;
Whereas the common organization of the market in bananas established by Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 (4) set the framework for continuing, on the Community market, the advantages enjoyed by traditional ACP suppliers, in accordance with the Community's commitment set out above;
Whereas risks exist nevertheless that the introduction of a new market organization and the need to adapt to it could jeopardize the continuing viability of ACP supplies;
Whereas particular efforts will be needed to adapt to the new market conditions in order to take advantage of the opportunities offered;
Whereas the structure and the nature of the new market and the marketing efforts necessary to maintain a presence on this market represent new elements some of which either the traditional ACP suppliers not the operators handling this procedure could reasonably foresee;
Whereas technical and financial assistance, additional to that provided for in the fourth ACP-EC Convention, should therefore be provided to carry out programmes designed to assist producers to adapt to new market conditions and in particular to improve quality, to improve marketing and to improve competitiveness;
Whereas the new conditions prevailing on the market may result in temporary market disturbances, particularly in the sectors of the Community market traditionally supplied by the ACP States;
Whereas such disturbances could seriously affect the income of the ACP States from the market and therefore the continued viability of the production in question;
Whereas financial assistance should therefore be provided to permit the ACP States to remain on the market, until such time as the market stabilizes and a satisfactory economic return from the market can be received;
Whereas income support should be complementary to transfers under the export earnings stabilization system (Stabex) triggered by the same set of circumstances;
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to align calculation of income support with the calculation of Stabex transfers;
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 2686/94 (5) introduced financial assistance in the form of income support;
Whereas that Regulation expired on 28 February 1996;
Whereas the statistics necessary for the calculation of Stabex transfers and income support to be granted for the preceding year are not available until the second quarter of each year, thus, in order to satisfy the overall requirements of the system, the rules laid down by Regulation (EC) No 2686/94 should continue to be applied until 31 December 1996;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3711/88 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 341/89 (4), fixes the target ceiling for imports of olive oil into Portugal for the 1988/89 marketing year; whereas, in the present situation of the market in olive oil in Portugal, a feature of which is limited supply compared with demand, provision should be made for a definitive measure to increase the target ceiling for the current marketing year in order to ensure normal supply to the market;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
(1) Whereas the White Paper entitled 'An energy policy for the European Union` of 13 December 1995 proposed a new approach to the monitoring of energy trends based on cooperation with the Member States and which would give added benefits by establishing and encouraging the most effective methods, promoting a shared approach to studies and analyses and encouraging the exchange of know-how in the field in question;
(2) Whereas in its resolution of 8 July 1996 on the abovementioned White Paper (3), the Council believed that energy decision-making at Community level needed to be placed in the context of a shared analysis of the energy situation and of future trends and invited the Commission to organise cooperation between the Member States;
(3) Whereas in its conclusions of 11 May 1998 on the Kyoto Protocol, the Council welcomed the Commission's presentation on energy policy options for responding to the climate change challenge and stressed the need to prepare a shared analysis of the economic impact of the greenhouse gas emission reductions;
(4) Whereas, in its conclusions, the Cardiff European Council of 15-16 June 1998 invited the Energy Council to give effect to environmental integration and sustainable development within its policy area and invited the Council and the Commission to keep under review the organisational arrangements necessary to carry this forward; whereas it is therefore necessary to develop appropriate indicators to monitor progress in this area;
(5) Whereas forward analyses and market monitoring at Community and Member State levels are essential for the development of an adequate strategy for the medium and long term; whereas shared analyses with Member States and interested parties should be encouraged in this field;
(6) Whereas security of energy supplies is one of the key energy policy objectives; whereas in the context of growing external energy dependency of the European Community, it is necessary to monitor closely and analyse energy market trends both within the Community and at world level;
(7) Whereas, to ensure competitive energy prices, it is essential to monitor regularly at Community level the implementation process of the two key liberalisation Directives which have recently been adopted for the electricity and gas markets;
(8) Whereas this monitoring process should be based on cooperation with Member State administrations and regulators, facilitating the exchange of best practices and ensuring greater transparency along the lines of the model initiated by the Commission for the internal electricity and gas markets;
(9) Whereas provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998-2002) adopted by Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom (4), for a specific programme of studies, analyses, forecasts and other related work in the energy sector;
(10) Whereas, in order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work avoided, the Commission should ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; whereas it should systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects;
(11) Whereas some of these activities should be open to participation by international organisations responsible for energy matters, such as the International Energy Agency and the Energy Charter Secretariat, bodies representing industry, other interested parties, for example environmental organisations and consumers, and certain third countries, in accordance with the rules governing the Community's relations with those organisations and countries;
(12) Whereas this set of actions should be coordinated with the other activities of the Community, the Member States, third countries and international organisations;
(13) Whereas it is politically and economically desirable to open up this programme to the associated central and eastern European countries in accordance with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of 21-22 June 1993 and as outlined in the Commission communication on that subject in May 1994; whereas it should also be open to Cyprus;
(14) Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 (5), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of this programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty; whereas account should be taken of the fact that a new financial perspective will be negotiated during the course of this programme;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(Only the English text is authentic)
(2008/794/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 of 16 January 2008 fixing for 2008 the fishing opportunities and associated conditions for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in Community waters and, for Community vessels, in waters where catch limitations are required (1), and in particular point 9 of Annex IIC thereto,
Having regard to the requests made by the United Kingdom,
Whereas:
(1) Point 7 of Annex IIC to Regulation (EC) No 40/2008 specifies the maximum number of days at sea (192) for which Community vessels of length overall equal to or greater than 10 meters carrying on board beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm or static nets, including gill-nets, trammel-nets and tangle-nets, with mesh size less than 220 mm may be present within ICES division VIIe from 1 February 2008 to 31 January 2009.
(2) Point 9 of that Annex enables the Commission to allocate an additional number of days at sea for which a vessel may be present within that area when carrying on board such beam trawls or static nets, on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place since 1 January 2004.
(3) The United Kingdom has submitted data demonstrating that vessels which ceased activities since 1 January 2004, excluding those already taken into account in earlier years, deployed 3,36 % of the fishing effort expended during the year 2003, taken as reference period for vessels present in the area and carrying on board beam trawls of mesh size equal to or greater than 80 mm.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 of 20 February 2006 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 33(2)(a) and (4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 32(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(b), (c), (d) and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex VII to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 318/2006.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 318/2006 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

terminating the investigation concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Taiwan and accepting an undertaking offered in the context of the review concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan and terminating the proceeding
(89/573/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Articles 9 and 10 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for in the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In 1983 the Commission initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide in Japan (2), and imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on this product (3). The Council later accepted the undertakings offered by the Japanese exporters of the product concerned (4).
(2) In November 1988, pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission received requests from the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) for a review of the measures taken against the Japanese exporter and for the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Taiwan.
The requests contained what was judged to be sufficient evidence of dumping and of resulting material injury to warrant the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(3) Consequently, in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (5), the Commission announced a review and the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan and Taiwan respectively. The Commission also pointed out that pursuant to Article 15 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 the undertakings given by the Japanese exporters covered by the review would remain in force pending the outcome of the review.
(4) The Commission officially advised the exporters/producers and importers known to be concerned. Japan's representatives and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned an opportunity to make known their views in writing and request a hearing.
(5) The Community, the exporters/producers and some importers made known their views in writing. One exporter requested and obtained a hearing.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purposes of making a preliminary determination of dumping and carried out inspections at the premises of:
(a) Community producers:
- N.V. Hercules Europe SA, Brussels, Belgium,
- Montefluos, Milan, Italy;
(b) producers/exporters in non-member countries:
- Concord Chemical industrial Co., Taipei, Taiwan,
- Nippon Oils and Fats Co. Ltd (NOF), Tokyo, Japan.
(7) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 1988 to 31 December 1988.
B. PRODUCT
(8) This proceeding concerns imports of dicumyl peroxide falling within CN code 2909 60 10 (formerly Nimexe code 29 08 91). The product is used to vulcanize rubber and as an additive in fireproofed polystyrene.
(9) In order to assess the effect on the Community industry of imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan or Taiwan, the Commission examined the degree to which the chemical and physical characteristics of the imported products and those from Community producers were comparable, and concluded that these characteristics and the use to which the product was put were identical.
C. INITIATION OF ANTI-DUMPING PROCEEDING AND TERMINATION - TAIWAN
1. Dumping
(a) Normal value
(10) Normal value was calculated on the basis of the prices charged each month in transactions on the domestic market by the Concord Chemical Industrial Co., which exported the product to the Community and provided satisfactory evidence.
(b) Export price
(11) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the Community.
(c) Comparison
(12) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission, in accordance with Article 2 (10) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, took account where appropriate of differences affecting price comparability, such as transport, commissions and credit terms. Monthly normal value figures were compared with export prices for the corresponding month on an ex works basis, transaction by transaction.
(d) Dumping margins
(13) The dumping margin was calculated as being the difference between the normal value established and the duly adjusted export price in the Community. On the basis of the free-at-Community-frontier price no dumping margin emerged.
2. Injury
(14) In the light of this failure to find that dumping was taking place, the Commission considered that there were no grounds for determining whether or not injury had occurred as a result of the imports in question and thus whether or not there was a threat of injury.
3. Termination of the proceeding
(15) In the light of the above, notably the absence of dumping, the Commission considers that no protective measures are needed and that the proceeding should be terminated.
D. REVIEW (SUNSET) - JAPAN
1. Dumping
(a) Normal value
(16) Normal value was calculated on the basis of the prices charged each month in transactions on the domestic market by NOF, which exported the product to the Community and provided satisfactory evidence.
(b) Export price
(17) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the product sold for export to the Community.
(c) Comparison
(18) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission, in accordance with Article 2 (10) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, took account where appropriate of differences affecting price comparability, such as transport, commissions and credit terms. Monthly normal value figures were compared with export prices for the corresponding month on an ex-works basis, transaction by transaction.
(d) Dumping margins
(19) The dumping margin was calculated as being the difference between the normal value established and the duly adjusted export price in the Community. On the basis of the free-at-Community-frontier price the weighted average margin was 52 % for NOF.
2. Injury over the period covered by the investigation
(20) In order to determine whether the dumped imports had injured the Community industry, the Commission took account of the following factors. (a) Volume of dumped imports
(21) The Commission observed that between 1985 and 1988 imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan remained stable at the level of the quantitative undertaking given by the Japanese producer.
(22) Japan's market share has fallen from 14 % to 8 % as a result of the growth in the consumption of dicumyl peroxide in the Community, which has risen by 79 %, from 880 tonnes to 1 576 tonnes.
(b) Difference in prices
(23) As regards the import prices, the evidence in the Commission's possession reveals no undercutting of the Community industry's prices during the reference period. It should be noted that over 60 % of the Japanese exports go to Belgium, where their only buyer, for reasons of security of supply, purchases at the same price from all its suppliers, whether these be from within the Community or not. The price is quite substantially higher than that paid by other customers.
(24) Given the specific nature of this situation, the Commission examined the impact of the price of Japanese imports in relation to production costs in the Community, with a profit level of 15 % added, this being considered reasonable and usual in the industry in order to ensure its development. The Commission established that the prices of the Japanese imports were 32 % lower on the German market, the only representative one in this case, since the Japanese exporter's sales on the Spanish market are low and the Belgian market is influenced by the dominant position of the user.
(c) Impact on the Community industry
(25) The Commission noted the following:
- Community production
Between 1985 and 1988 Community production of dicumyl peroxide rose from 590 tonnes to 1 403 tonnes, an increase of approximately 138 %.
- Utilization of capacity
Utilization of Community production capacity has risen from 39 % to 62 %. Though this is not an insignificant rise, utilization of production capacity remains far below what it should be, particularly in comparison with that of the producers in the non-member countries covered by the investigation.
- Sales and market share
Between 1985 and 1988 Community producers' sales of dicumyl peroxide rose both on the Community market (up 128 %) and on export markets (up 193 %). Their market share in the Community therefore rose from 52 % to 66 %.
- Price reductions
An examination of the information obtained showed an appreciable drop in prices on the Community market between 1985 and 1988.
- Profitability
The profitability of Community producers has deteriorated substantially in the last two years. Within the Community industry since 1987, one producer's losses have risen considerably, and the profits of another decreased drastically.
(26) On the basis of the figures given above the Commission has come to the following conclusions:
- a situation of contrast emerges; while some negative points, such as under-utilization of production capacity and particularly a deterioration of financial performance, are apparent, other aspects show a degree of buoyancy. Community production has risen considerably over the last four years, sales inside and outside the Community have increased sharply and the market share of Community producers has improved substantially.
in addition to these factors, the following were considered:
- imports from the Japanese exporter have remained stable in quantity terms. Its market share has decreased, as it has been unable to profit from the increase in Community consumption of dicumyl peroxide because of the quantity undertaking. Moreover, no price undercutting on its part could be found (see point 23), although some instances of prices lower than those prevailing on the Community market were found (see point 24),
- in addition, it should be noted that the drop in prices which occurred on the Community market can be put down partly to competition from Taiwanese imports and partly to technical progress in production processes.
(27) The considerations set out above led the Commission to conclude that even if the Community industry's situation is not flourishing the difficulties confronting it are not a result of the impact of dumped Japanese imports.
3. Threat of injury as a result of the expiry of the measures in force
(28) It should none the less be determined whether the expiry of the anti-dumping measures in force is likely to cause or threaten to cause injury. In this connection the Commission has taken the following into account:
- the Japanese producer, which already produces substantialy more than any of the Community producers, anticipates a rise in its dicumyl peroxide production of 16 % by 1990. Given the situation of the Community market this can be regarded as a significant increase,
- considering that its exports to the Community in 1988 accounted for less than 7 % of its sales, there is a high probability that the exporter in question will be led to increase its share of the Community market in the near future, since its prospects on its domestic market and the markets of non-Community countries seem limited,
- the Commission also took account of the fact that a dumping margin of 52 % had been calculated for 1988. Although the difficulties the Community industry is facing are largely attributable to other factors it is very likely that a serious distortion of the Community market would occur if the restrictions currently in force were lifted. The reason is that the exporter concerned would see an advantage in dumping products on the Community market: the exporter can rely on substantial profits from the domestic market, and would be able to align prices on those of other producers or even undercut them.
This would expose the Community producers to unfair competition from the Japanese exporter, something which would be likely to increase their financial losses and thus cause considerable injury.
E. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(29) In the light of the observations set out above, and considering particularly the size of the dumping margin, the genuine threat of injury and the absence of representations from users and consumers, the Commission takes the view that a failure to institute measures would in time lead to the disappearance of the Community industry; this in turn would make the downstream industries, notably the cable industry, more vulnerable from the point of view of supply.
In this connection, the Japanese exporter expressed the opinion that it would not be in the Community's interest to institute measures solely against Japan. According to the exporter, Japan itself would then not be in a position to compete against its competitors, particularly the Taiwanese, which charged very low prices; it would as a result be excluded from the Community market, to the profit of its competitor.
(30) The Commission regards this argument as unfounded in so far as the retention of protective measures against Japan should not have any substantial effect on the present state of competition between the two countries, considering the destination of Japanese exports. Whatever the case, the Commission considers that the protective measure it intends to take will ensure fair competition on the Community market.
(31) In the light of the above, the Commission confirms that it is in the interest of the Community to retain protective measures against the imports concerned.
F. UNDERTATING AND TERMINATION OF THE REVIEW
(32) Having been notified of the main conclusions, NOF, the Japanese exporter, offered an undertaking on the price of its exports of dicumyl peroxide to the Community.
This undertaking will bring the price of exports to the Community to a level which the Commission considers sufficient to prevent the injury which the expiry of the anti-dumping measures currently in force would otherwise inevitably have brought about.
(33) In these circumstances the undertaking should be considered acceptable, and since the Advisory Committee has expressed no objection to the proposals the investigation may therefore be terminated.","{'title': '89/573/EEC: Commission Decision of 30 October 1989 terminating the investigation concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Taiwan and accepting an undertaking offered in the context of the review concerning imports of dicumyl peroxide originating in Japan and terminating the proceeding', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking offered by the Nippon Oils and Fats Co.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2), and in particular Articles 7 and 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (3), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/97 of 26 September 1997 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway (4), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1891/97 of 26 September 1997 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway (5), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES
(1) In the framework of the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations initiated by two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (6), the Commission had accepted, on 26 September 1997, by Decision 97/634/EC (7), undertakings offered by the Kingdom of Norway and by 190 Norwegian exporters. These undertakings apply to all sales invoiced by these exporters since 1 July 1997.
Subsequent to the acceptance of these undertakings, the Commission had reasons to believe that 29 exporters were failing to comply with the terms of these undertakings:
- it appeared from their reports relating to the third quarter 1997 that six Norwegian exporters had made sales on the Community market below the minimum price stipulated in the undertaking for each presentation of the product concerned,
- 23 Norwegian exporters failed to comply with their obligation to submit their report relating to the third quarter 1997 within the prescribed time limit, or did not submit such report at all. These exporters did not provide any evidence of force majeure to justify such late reporting.
(2) Consequently, the Commission, by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2529/97 (8), hereinafter referred to as the Provisional Duty Regulation, imposed provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon falling within CN codes ex 0302 12 00, ex 0304 10 13, ex 0303 22 00 and ex 0304 20 originating in Norway and exported by the companies listed in Annex I to that Regulation.
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE
(3) All Norwegian companies concerned by the provisional duties received disclosure in writing concerning the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which these duties were imposed.
(4) Within the time limit set in the Provisional Duty Regulation, most of the Norwegian companies concerned submitted comments in writing.
(5) Subsequent to the written submissions received, the Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a definitive determination on the apparent violations, and carried out verification visits at the premises of the following companies in Norway:
- Fresh Marine Company AS (Taric additional code 8149), and
- Seanor AS (Taric additional code 8272).
C. DEFINITIVE FINDINGS
(6) During the subsequent procedure, four companies could provide satisfactory evidence demonstrating that the provisional findings resulted inter alia from erroneous or unclear reporting on the part of the companies concerned. In fact, the actual average sales prices of these companies for the respective presentations of the product concerned were such that they did not violate the minimum price as stipulated in the undertaking.
(7) One of the companies which apparently had failed to send its undertaking report within the time limit set could finally provide evidence that despite the adverse prima facie evidence initially available, it had in fact delivered its report in time to the local post office.
(8) For the aforementioned five exporters therefore, the breach of their undertakings provisionally established cannot be definitively confirmed. Consequently, following the exporters' confirmation that they intend to continue to adhere to their undertakings, the status quo ante should be re-established as regards these companies' undertakings.
(9) Therefore, for the following five companies, the provisional measures are to be repealed, the amounts secured by way of provisional duty are to be released, and their undertakings reinstated.
>TABLE>
(10) Parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to repeal the provisional anti-dumping and countervailing duties and reinstate their undertakings. No further comments were received.
(11) None of the other companies which failed to respect their reporting obligations submitted any valid evidence of force majeure as allowed by the undertaking.
In the absence of specific provisions in this regard in the basis anti-dumping and anti-subsidies regulations, and in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice, the justification invoked by each company as circumstances constituting force majeure can only be recognised as such where the failure was the inevitable result of an extraneous cause which could not reasonably have been foreseen or pre-empted and made it objectively impossible for the company concerned to comply with its obligations.
In this regard, all circumstances invoked by the parties concerned, e.g. the holidays of a responsible person, misunderstanding about the scope of the undertakings, loss of time management software, erroneous filing of correspondence, cannot be considered as circumstances constituting force majeure.
(12) On the basis of the foregoing it is concluded that two Norwegian exporters have breached their obligation to respect the minimum price. In addition, 22 other Norwegian exporters have breached the reporting requirements of their undertakings.
(13) Parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to confirm the withdrawal of the Commission's acceptance of their undertaking and to recommend the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties and the definitive collection of the amounts secured by way of provisional duties. They were also granted a period within which to make representations subsequent to this disclosure.
D. NEWCOMERS
(14) Following the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties, several companies made themselves known to the Commission claiming to be new exporters, and offered undertakings.
(15) In this regard, one such company, Nor-Fa Food AS could demonstrate that if had not exported to the Community during the investigation period relevant for the investigations which led to the current anti-dumping and countervailing measures. This company could show that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in Norway which are subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures on farmed Atlantic salmon. Finally, it demonstrated that it had entered into irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity of farmed Atlantic salmon to the Community.
The undertaking offered is identical in its terms to those previously accepted from other Norwegian exporters of farmed Atlantic salmon, and it is considered that the acceptance of an undertaking in these terms from this exporter will be sufficient to remove the injurious effects of dumping.
Since the exporter has agreed to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information on its exports to the Community, it is concluded that the correct observance of the undertaking can be effectively monitored by the Commission.
(16) The undertaking offered by this company is therefore considered acceptable. The company was informed of the essential facts and considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking be based. The Advisory Committee was consulted and no objections were raised as to the acceptance of the undertaking offered. Therefore, pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1890/97 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1891/97, the Annexes to these two Regulations should be amended to extend the exemption from the payment of the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to this new exporter.
E. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC
(17) The Commission is in parallel to this Regulation submitting a proposal for a Council regulation imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and exported by the other 24 companies which are subject to the provisional duty imposed by the Provisional Duty Regulation and for which the breach of the undertaking has been confirmed by the definitive findings made.
In addition, certain companies informed the Commission, that their name had been changed or that their name as shown in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC is not correct. Where a company has changed its name, the Commission verified that there was no change in the corporate structure which would call for a more detailed examination of the appropriateness of maintaining its undertaking.
The Annex to Decision 97/634/EC accepting undertakings in the context of the present anti-dumping and anti-subsidies proceedings should be amended to take account of the acceptance of the undertaking by the newcomer Nor-Fa Food AS, the change of name of Skaarfish Group AS, the correction of the name indicated for West Fish Sales Ltd and the reinstatement of the undertakings given by the companies in respect of which the provisional duty is being repealed.

DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/720 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 29 April 2015
amending Directive 94/62/EC as regards reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 114 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national Parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC (4) was adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment. Although plastic carrier bags constitute packaging within the meaning of that Directive, it does not contain specific measures on the consumption of such bags.
(2) The current consumption levels of plastic carrier bags result in high levels of littering and an inefficient use of resources, and are expected to increase if no action is taken. Littering of plastic carrier bags results in environmental pollution and aggravates the widespread problem of litter in water bodies, threatening aquatic eco-systems worldwide.
(3) Furthermore, the accumulation of plastic carrier bags in the environment has a clearly negative impact on certain economic activities.
(4) Plastic carrier bags with a wall thickness below 50 microns (‘lightweight plastic carrier bags’), which represent the vast majority of the total number of plastic carrier bags consumed in the Union, are less frequently reused than thicker plastic carrier bags. Consequently, lightweight plastic carrier bags become waste more quickly and are more prone to littering due to their light weight.
(5) Current recycling rates of lightweight plastic carrier bags are very low and, due to a number of practical and economic difficulties, are not likely to reach significant levels in the near future.
(6) According to the waste hierarchy, prevention comes first. Plastic carrier bags serve several purposes and their consumption will continue in the future. To ensure that the needed plastic carrier bags will not end up as waste in the environment, adequate measures should be in place and consumers should be informed about proper waste treatment.
(7) Consumption levels of plastic carrier bags vary considerably across the Union due to differences in consumption habits, environmental awareness and effectiveness of policy measures taken by Member States. Some Member States have managed to reduce consumption levels of plastic carrier bags significantly, with the average consumption level in the seven best performing Member States amounting to only 20 % of the Union average consumption.
(8) The availability and accuracy of data on the current consumption levels of lightweight plastic carrier bags vary between Member States. Accurate and comparable data on consumption is key to assess the effectiveness of reduction measures and to ensure uniform conditions for implementation. Therefore, a common methodology for the calculation of annual consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags per person should be developed with a view to monitoring progress in reducing consumption of such bags.
(9) Furthermore, consumer information has been shown to play a decisive role in achieving any goals regarding a reduction in the consumption of plastic carrier bags. Therefore, efforts at institutional level are necessary to increase awareness of the environmental impact of plastic carrier bags and end the current perception of plastic as a harmless and cheap commodity.
(10) To promote sustained reductions of the average consumption level of lightweight plastic carrier bags, Member States should take measures to significantly reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags in line with the overall objectives of the Union's waste policy and the waste hierarchy as provided for in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5). Such reduction measures should take account of current consumption levels of plastic carrier bags in individual Member States, with higher levels requiring more ambitious efforts, and take account of reductions already achieved. To monitor progress in reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, it is necessary that national authorities provide data on their consumption in accordance with Article 12 of Directive 94/62/EC.
(11) Measures to be taken by Member States may involve the use of economic instruments such as pricing, taxes and levies, which have proved particularly effective in reducing the consumption of plastic carrier bags, and marketing restrictions such as bans in derogation of Article 18 of Directive 94/62/EC provided that these restrictions are proportionate and non-discriminatory.
(12) Those measures may vary depending on the environmental impact of lightweight plastic carrier bags when they are recovered or disposed of, their recycling and composting properties, their durability or the specific intended use of those bags, and taking into account any possible adverse substitution effects.
(13) Member States may choose to exempt plastic carrier bags with a wall thickness below 15 microns (‘very lightweight plastic carrier bags’) provided as primary packaging for loose food when required for hygiene purposes or when their use helps prevent food wastage.
(14) Member States may freely use revenues generated by measures that are taken under Directive 94/62/EC to achieve a sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags.
(15) Awareness programmes for consumers in general and educational programmes for children can play an important role in reducing the consumption of plastic carrier bags.
(16) European Standard EN 13432 on ‘Requirements for packaging recoverable through composting and biodegradation — Test scheme and evaluation criteria for the final acceptance of packaging’ sets out the characteristics that a material must possess to be considered ‘compostable’, namely that it can be recycled through a process of organic recovery comprised of composting and anaerobic digestion. The Commission should ask the European Committee for Standardization to develop a separate standard for home-compostable packaging.
(17) It is important to ensure Union-wide recognition of labels or marks for biodegradable and compostable plastic carrier bags.
(18) Some plastic carrier bags are marked as ‘oxo-biodegradable’ or ‘oxo-degradable’ by their manufacturers. In such bags, additives are incorporated into conventional plastics. Due to the presence of those additives, the plastic fragments over time into small particles which remain in the environment. It can thus be misleading to refer to such bags as ‘biodegradable’ as they may not be a solution to littering and may, on the contrary, increase pollution. The Commission should examine the impact of the use of oxo-degradable plastic carrier bags on the environment and present a report to the European Parliament and the Council, including, if appropriate, a set of measures to limit their consumption or to reduce any harmful impacts.
(19) Measures to be taken by Member States to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags should lead to a sustained reduction in the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, and should not lead to an overall increase in the generation of packaging.
(20) The measures provided for by this Directive are consistent with the Commission Communication on the Roadmap to a Resource Efficient Europe and they should contribute to actions against marine littering, undertaken in accordance with Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (6).
(21) Directive 94/62/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '6.5.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 115/11', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE (EU) 2015/720 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 29 April 2015\namending Directive 94/62/EC as regards reducing the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC(4)was adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment.

of 24 June 1988

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 21 of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Morocco (1) stipulates that certain wines having a registered designation of origin, falling within CN codes ex 2204 21 25, ex 2204 21 29, ex 2204 21 35 and ex 2204 21 39 and originating in Morocco, specified in the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters of 12 March 1977 (2), shall be imported into the Community free of customs duties within the limits of an annual Community tariff quota of 50 000 hectolitres; whereas these wines must be put up in containers holding two litres or less; whereas these wines must be accompanied either by a certificate of designation of origin in accordance with the model given in Annex D to the Agreement or, by way of derogation, by a document VI 1 or a VI 2 extract annotated in compliance with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 3590/85 (3);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 449/86 of 24 February 1986 determining the arrangements to be applied by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to trade with certain third countries (4), the provisions applicable by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to trade with Morocco are subject to the tariff treatment and other trade rules applied to third countries enjoying most-favoured-nation treatment; whereas, therefore, this Regulation applies only to the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985; whereas, consequently this Regulation does not apply to Portugal; whereas the Community tariff quota in question should be opened for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989;
Whereas the wines in question are subject to compliance with the free-at-frontier reference price; whereas, in order that such wine may benefit from this tariff quota, Article 54 of Regulation (EEC) No 822/87 (5) as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1441/88 (6), must be complied with;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quota, and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for this quota to all imports of the products concerned into the Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, in order to reflect most accurately the actual development of the market in the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, assessed by reference to both the statistics relating to imports of the said products from Morocco over a representative reference period and the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas in this case, however, neither Community nor national statistics showing the breakdown for each of the types of wines in question are available and no reliable estimates of future imports can be made; whereas, in these circumstances, the quota volume should be allocated in initial shares, taking into account demand for these wines on the markets of the various Member States;
Whereas, to take account of import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota amount should be divided into two instalments, the first being allocated among the Member States and the second held as a reserve intended to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States who have used up their initial share; whereas in order to guarantee some degree of security to importers in each Member State, the first instalment of the Community quota should be fixed at a level which could, in the present circumstances, be 20 % of the quota volume;
Whereas the initial shares of the Member States may be used up at different rates; whereas, in order to take this into account and to avoid a break in continuity, any Member State which has used up almost all of its initial share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this should be done by each Member State each time one of its additional shares is almost used up, and so on as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be in a position to follow the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas, if at a given date in the quota period a substantial quantity of its initial share remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that it should return a significant proportion thereof to the reserve, to prevent part of the Community quota remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of the shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1842/88 of 24 June 1988 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain wines having a registered designation of origin, and originating in Morocco (1988/89)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) The third subparagraph of Article 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1359/2007 of 21 November 2007 laying down the conditions for granting special export refunds on certain cuts of boned meat of bovine animals (5) provides for a reduction of the special refund if the quantity of cuts of boned meat to be exported amounts to less than 95 %, but not less than 85 %, of the total weight of cuts produced by boning.
(6) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 945/2011 (6). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.

","Regulation (EC) No 807/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 21 April 2004
amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 156 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) The High-Level Group on the trans-European transport network chaired by Mr Karel Van Miert expressed concern that the delays in the cross-border sections of the priority projects on the trans-European transport network (TEN) were having an adverse effect on the profitability of the investments made by the Member States in the sections in their own country, denying them the benefit of economies of scale, and recommended that the rate of Community financing should be differentiated, according to the benefits to other countries, in particular the neighbouring countries, stressing that such modulation should in the first instance benefit the cross-border projects used by long-distance transport services. Moreover, the Community financing rate should be differentiated according to the extent to which the project's economic benefits exceed its financial profitability.
(2) To this end the High-Level Group recommended a higher rate of Community aid to promote completion of the cross-border connections for the priority projects and added that the budgetary impact of such a change would be limited. This should be implemented bearing in mind the need to focus TENs resources on key projects, while recognising the need for continued financial support for non-priority projects.
(3) The possibility should be given to meet the budgetary commitments by means of annual instalments, while basing them on a global and multiannual legal commitment.
(4) A temporary increase in the rate of Community aid may provide an incentive for actors to speed up and to render effective the implementation of priority projects covered by this Regulation.
(5) The establishment of public-private partnerships (or of other forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors) demands a firm financial commitment from institutional investors which is sufficiently attractive to raise private capital. Granting Community financial aid on a multiannual basis would remove the uncertainties which are slowing down project development. Measures should therefore be taken to grant financial support to the projects selected on the basis of a multiannual legal commitment.
(6) Cross-border connections between energy networks are important for ensuring smooth operation of the internal market, security of supply and optimum use of energy infrastructure. Priority projects on the energy networks, which are necessary in the interests of the European economy but unprofitable in business terms and which do not distort competition between enterprises, should therefore also qualify for higher financial aid. This aid is in respect of priority projects on the energy networks.
(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95(4) should be adapted to take account of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(5).

Whereas on 30 October 1987 the Portuguese Government forwarded a specific programme concerning the meat sector in the autonomous region of the Azores and submitted supplementary information on 1 July 1988;
Whereas the aim of this specific programme is to rationalize and adapt the marketing and processing of live animals, their meat, processed products and eggs so as to increase the competitiveness of the sector and add value to its production; whereas it therefore constitutes a programme within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) no 355/77;

Whereas approval of this programme does not extend to investments in cold storage facilities unless these are attached to processing and/or marketing facilities;
Whereas approval of this programme does not extend to investments in slaughterhouses and other equipment which do not accord with the Community's public health legislation;

Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 79/542/EEC(5), as last amended by Decision 2001/731/EC(6), establishing a list of third countries from which Member States authorise imports of bovine animals, swine, equidae, sheep and goats, fresh meat and meat products includes Turkey in Part 2 of the Annex, thus allowing only the importation of registered horses.
(2) Under Commission Decision 92/160/EEC of 5 March 1992 establishing the regionalisation of certain third countries for imports of equidae(7), as last amended by Decision 2001/622/EC(8), as regards Turkey only temporary admission and re-entry of registered horses are allowed and only from six provinces.
(3) The health conditions and veterinary certification for the temporary admission, permanent imports and re-entry of registered horses are harmonised and laid down respectively in Commission Decisions 92/260/EEC(9) and 93/197/EEC(10), both as last amended by Decision 2001/828/EC(11), and Commission Decision 93/195/EEC(12), as last amended by Decision 2001/611/EC(13).
(4) In the case of Turkey the animal health conditions and veterinary certification are laid down for the temporary admission and re-entry after temporary export of registered horses respectively in Decisions 92/260/EEC and 93/195/EEC.
(5) As in the course of a Commission inspection visit to Turkey in 1998 serious flaws have come to light in the procedures for exporting horses from Turkey to the Community, the Commission adopted Decision 98/404/EC of 12 June 1998 introducing protective measures with regard to importation of equidae from Turkey(14), as last amended by Decision 2000/507/EC(15).
(6) After the adoption of Decision 98/404/EC the competent authorities of Turkey communicated to the Commission measures directed at improving veterinary supervision and export certification based on recommendations made by the Commission following that inspection visit.
(7) In addition, the competent authorities, assisted by the private horse sector, have completed a glanders surveillance programme, which also included surveillance for African horse sickness and dourine, and submitted to the Commission a final report in April 2001. The surveillance programme confirmed with regard to the prevalence of glanders the findings of the mission carried out in 1998. A large number of mallein reactors identified amongst non-registered horses, mules and donkeys have been destroyed and compensated.
(8) It appears therefore appropriate to allow temporary admission, re-entry after temporary export of Community registered horses and permanent imports of registered horses from those provinces in Turkey listed in Decision 92/160/EEC under the animal health conditions established for registered horses from areas of similar epidemiological situation. However, health tests required in accordance with the relevant conditions for imports shall be carried out in laboratories agreed by the Member State of destination.
(9) Decisions 92/160/EEC, 92/260/EEC and 93/197/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly and Decision 98/404/EC repealed.

of 3 June 2010
amending Decision 2008/839/JHA on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 74 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (1) and by Council Decision 2007/533/JHA of 12 June 2007 on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (2).
(2) The conditions, procedures and responsibilities applicable to the migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II are laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 of 24 October 2008 on migration from the Schengen Information System (SIS 1+) to the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) (3) and Decision 2008/839/JHA (4). However, those instruments will expire at the latest on 30 June 2010.
(3) The preconditions for migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II will not be met by 30 June 2010. In order for SIS II to become operational as required by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA, Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 and Decision 2008/839/JHA should therefore continue to apply until migration has been completed.
(4) The Commission and the Member States should continue to cooperate closely during all steps of the development and the migration in order to complete the process. In the Council Conclusions on the SIS II of 26-27 February 2009 and 4-5 June 2009, an informal body consisting of the experts of the Member States and designated as the Global Programme Management Board, was established to enhance the cooperation and to provide direct Member States support to the central SIS II project. The positive result of the work of the group and the necessity to further enhance the cooperation and the transparency of the project justify the formal integration of the group into the SIS II management structure. A group of experts, called the Global Programme Management Board should therefore be formally established to complement the current organisational structure. In order to ensure efficiency as well as cost effectiveness the number of experts should be limited. This group of experts should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Commission and of the Member States.
(5) The Commission should remain responsible for the Central SIS II and its communication infrastructure. It is necessary to maintain and, where appropriate, further develop the Central SIS II and its communication infrastructure. Additional development of the Central SIS II should at all times include the correction of errors. The Commission should provide coordination and support for the joint activities.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA provide that the best available technology, subject to a cost-benefit analysis, should be used for Central SIS II. The Annex to the Council Conclusions on the further direction of SIS II from 4-5 June 2009 laid down milestones which should be met in order to continue with the current SIS II project. In parallel, a study has been conducted concerning the elaboration of an alternative technical scenario for developing SIS II based on SIS 1+ evolution (SIS 1+ RE) as the contingency plan, in case the tests demonstrate non-compliance with the milestone requirements. Based on these parameters, the Council may decide to invite the Commission to switch to the alternative technical scenario.
(7) The description of the technical components of the migration architecture therefore should be adapted to allow for another technical solution, and in particular the SIS 1+ RE regarding the development of Central SIS II. SIS 1+ RE is a possible technical solution to develop Central SIS II and to achieve the objectives of the SIS II laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA.
(8) The SIS 1+ RE is characterised by uniqueness of means between SIS II development and SIS 1+. The references in this Regulation to the technical architecture of SIS II and to the migration process should therefore, in case of implementation of an alternative technical scenario, be read as the references to SIS II based on another technical solution, as applied mutatis mutandis to the technical specificities of this solution, in keeping with the objective to develop Central SIS II.
(9) As regards the financing of the development of the Central SIS II based on an alternative technical solution, it should be covered by the general budget of the Union while respecting the principle of sound financial management. In accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5), the Commission may delegate budget implementation tasks to national public sector bodies. Following the political orientation and subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, the Commission would be invited, in case of switchover to the alternative solution, to delegate the budget implementation tasks related to the development of the SIS II based on SIS 1+ RE to France.
(10) In any technical scenario, the result of migration at central level should be availability of the SIS 1+ database and new SIS II functionalities, including additional data categories, in the Central SIS II.
(11) The Member States should remain responsible for their national systems (N.SIS II). It is still necessary to maintain and, where appropriate, further develop the N.SIS II.
(12) France should remain responsible for technical support function (C.SIS).
(13) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely setting up the interim migration architecture and migrating the data from SIS 1+ to SIS II, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on the European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol (No 22) on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 4 of that Protocol, decide within a period of 6 months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(15) The United Kingdom is taking part in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Protocol (No 19) on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (6).
(16) Ireland is taking part in this Regulation in accordance with Article 5(1) of the Protocol (No 19) on the Schengen acquis integrated into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and Article 6(2) of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis
 (7).
(17) This Regulation is without prejudice to the arrangements for the United Kingdom’s and Ireland’s partial participation in the Schengen acquis as determined by the Council Decision 2000/365/EC and Decision 2002/192/EC respectively.
(18) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (8), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement (9).
(19) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (10) which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/149/JHA (11).

However, those instruments will expire at the latest on 30 June 2010.\n\n((3)) The preconditions for migration from SIS 1+ to SIS II will not be met by 30 June 2010. In order for SIS II to become operational as required by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA, Regulation (EC) No 1104/2008 and Decision 2008/839/JHA should therefore continue to apply until migration has been completed.\n\n((4)) The Commission and the Member States should continue to cooperate closely during all steps of the development and the migration in order to complete the process. In the Council Conclusions on the SIS II of 26-27 February 2009 and 4-5 June 2009, an informal body consisting of the experts of the Member States and designated as the Global Programme Management Board, was established to enhance the cooperation and to provide direct Member States support to the central SIS II project. The positive result of the work of the group and the necessity to further enhance the cooperation and the transparency of the project justify the formal integration of the group into the SIS II management structure. A group of experts, called the Global Programme Management Board should therefore be formally established to complement the current organisational structure. In order to ensure efficiency as well as cost effectiveness the number of experts should be limited. This group of experts should be without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Commission and of the Member States.\n\n((5)) The Commission should remain responsible for the Central SIS II and its communication infrastructure. It is necessary to maintain and, where appropriate, further develop the Central SIS II and its communication infrastructure. Additional development of the Central SIS II should at all times include the correction of errors. The Commission should provide coordination and support for the joint activities.\n\n((6)) Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA provide that the best available technology, subject to a cost-benefit analysis, should be used for Central SIS II. The Annex to the Council Conclusions on the further direction of SIS II from 4-5 June 2009 laid down milestones which should be met in order to continue with the current SIS II project. In parallel, a study has been conducted concerning the elaboration of an alternative technical scenario for developing SIS II based on SIS 1+ evolution (SIS 1+ RE) as the contingency plan, in case the tests demonstrate non-compliance with the milestone requirements. Based on these parameters, the Council may decide to invite the Commission to switch to the alternative technical scenario.\n\n((7)) The description of the technical components of the migration architecture therefore should be adapted to allow for another technical solution, and in particular the SIS 1+ RE regarding the development of Central SIS II.

laying down detailed rules for the application of an import tariff quota for live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg and originating in Switzerland provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Following the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation agreed to proceed with the adaptation of tariff concessions within the framework of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (2) (hereinafter referred to as the Agreement). The adaptation of these tariff concessions, by Decision No 3/2005 of the Joint Committee on Agriculture (3) amending Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement, provides for the opening of a duty-free Community tariff quota for the import of 4 600 live bovine animals weighing more than 160 kg and originating in Switzerland. Detailed rules should be adopted for the opening and administration of this tariff quota on a multi-annual basis.
(2) For the allocation of the tariff quota and given the products concerned it is appropriate to apply the method of simultaneous examination referred to in the second indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
(3) To be eligible for the benefit of this tariff quota, live animals should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement.
(4) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in trade of a significant scale with third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the year previous to the annual quota period in question, as given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience has shown that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable.
(5) If such criteria are to be checked, applications should be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.
(6) Also in order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January previous to the beginning of the annual quota period in question should be denied access to the quota. Moreover, a security should be fixed for import rights, licences should not be transferable and import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.
(7) To provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, maximum and minimum limits should be fixed for the number of animals covered in each application.

The adaptation of these tariff concessions, by Decision No 3/2005 of the Joint Committee on Agriculture(3)amending Annexes 1 and 2 of the Agreement, provides for the opening of a duty-free Community tariff quota for the import of 4\xa0600 live bovine animals weighing more than 160\xa0kg and originating in Switzerland. Detailed rules should be adopted for the opening and administration of this tariff quota on a multi-annual basis.\n\n((2)) For the allocation of the tariff quota and given the products concerned it is appropriate to apply the method of simultaneous examination referred to in the second indent of Article 32(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.\n\n((3)) To be eligible for the benefit of this tariff quota, live animals should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement.\n\n((4)) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in trade of a significant scale with third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 50 animals during the year previous to the annual quota period in question, as given that a consignment of 50 animals may be considered to be a normal load. Experience has shown that the purchase of a single consignment is a minimum requirement for a transaction to be considered real and viable.\n\n((5)) If such criteria are to be checked, applications should be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.\n\n((6)) Also in order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January previous to the beginning of the annual quota period in question should be denied access to the quota. Moreover, a security should be fixed for import rights, licences should not be transferable and import licences should be issued to traders solely for the quantities for which they have been allocated import rights.\n\n((7)) To provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, maximum and minimum limits should be fixed for the number of animals covered in each application.\n\n((8)) It should be established that import rights are to be allocated after a reflection period and where necessary with a fixed allocation coefficient applied.\n\n((9)) Pursuant to Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999, the arrangements have to be managed using import licences.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(d) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Further to a complaint brought in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by certain countries, a WTO panel report adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body on 21 September 2010 (2) concluded that the European Union had acted, inter alia, inconsistently with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) by according tariff treatment less favourable than that provided in the tariff bindings with regard to certain information technology products made by the European Union pursuant to the Information Technology Agreement (ITA). Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 should be amended in order to bring it into conformity with the international obligations of the European Union under the GATT 1994. The required amendments are in accordance with Council Decision 97/359/EC of 24 March 1997 concerning the elimination of duties on information technology products (3), which approved the ITA.
(2) Following the WTO Panel Report, digital copying should not constitute photocopying under the GATT 1994 and copying speed should not be the sole classification criterion. Subheading 8443 31 of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 and the corresponding duty rate should therefore be amended accordingly.
(3) The wording of subheading 8528 71 15 of the CN (previously 8528 71 13) should be amended in order to include set-top boxes which, besides the function of communication, may be capable of performing the additional functions of recording or reproducing, provided that, as a result, they do not lose the essential character of a set-top box which has a communication function.
(4) This regulation should enter into force on 1 July 2011 at the end of the reasonable period of time agreed by the European Union with the complaining parties for the European Union to bring itself into conformity with its WTO obligations.
(5) As recommendations in reports adopted by the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body only have prospective effect, this regulation should not have retroactive effects nor provide interpretative guidance on a retroactive basis. Since it cannot operate to provide interpretative guidance for classification of goods which have been released for free circulation prior to 1 July 2011 it should not serve as a basis for the reimbursement of any duties paid prior to that date.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2894/94 of 28 November 1994 concerning arrangements for implementing the Agreement on the European Economic Area (1), and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State (2) is to be incorporated into the Agreement on the European Economic Area (‘EEA Agreement’).
(2) Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products (3) is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.
(3) Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products (4) is to be incorporated into the EEA Agreement.
(4) Decision No 768/2008/EC sets out common principles and reference provisions for future legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products and a reference text for existing legislation.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 repeals Decision No 3052/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1995 establishing a procedure for the exchange of information on national measures derogating from the principle of the free movement of goods within the Community (5) which is incorporated into the EEA Agreement. The EEA Agreement should therefore be amended to take account of Regulation (EC) No 764/2008.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Article 10(3) and Article 30(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) That list may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2).
(3) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Union list of food additives may be updated either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) An application for authorisation of the use of Talc (E 553b) and Carnauba wax (E 903) on unpeeled coloured boiled eggs and the use of Shellac (E 904) on unpeeled boiled eggs was submitted and was made available to the Member States.
(5) When used on the surface of unpeeled coloured boiled eggs the food additives Talc (E 553b), Carnauba wax (E 903) and Shellac (E 904) can serve decoration purposes by providing a more or less shining effect. In addition, Shellac (E 904) can contribute to a better preservation of all unpeeled boiled eggs when used on their surface.
(6) Those food additives are not expected to migrate into the internal edible part of the eggs due to their insolubility and to their high molecular weight. The use of those food additives is not liable to have an effect on human health as their waxes remain on the egg shell. It is therefore appropriate to allow the use of Talc (E 553b) and Carnauba wax (E 903) on unpeeled coloured boiled eggs and the use of Shellac (E 904) on all unpeeled boiled eggs, coloured as well as non-coloured.
(7) Pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, the Commission is to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority in order to update the Union list of food additives set out in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008, except where the update in question is not liable to have an effect on human health. Since the authorisation of use of Talc (E 553b), Carnauba wax (E 903) and Shellac (E 904) on unpeeled boiled eggs constitutes an update of that list which is not liable to have an effect on human health, it is not necessary to seek the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority.
(8) Pursuant to the transitional provisions of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1129/2011 of 11 November 2011 amending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing a Union list of food additives (3), Annex II establishing the Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and conditions of use applies from 1 June 2013. In order to allow the use of Talc (E 553b) and Carnauba wax (E 903) on unpeeled coloured boiled eggs and the use of Shellac (E 904) on unpeeled boiled eggs before that date, it is necessary to specify an earlier date of application with regard to those food additives.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 22 July 2013
amending Decision 97/836/EC with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’)

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(4) thereof, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) By Council Decision 97/836/EC (1), the Union has acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’).
(2) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive) (2) replaced the Member States’ approval systems with a Union approval procedure, establishing a harmonised framework containing the administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UNECE Regulations in the EU vehicle type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to EU legislation. Since the adoption of Directive 2007/46/EC, UNECE Regulations have increasingly been incorporated into Union legislation in the framework of EU vehicle type-approval.
(3) Changes to the Treaties on which the Union is founded occurred after the adoption of Decision 97/836/EC. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union has substantially altered the procedure to be followed for the conclusion of agreements between the Union and international organisations, making it necessary to adapt Decision 97/836/EC to the new procedures.
(4) The procedure for establishing the position to be adopted on the Union’s behalf in the United Nations concerning the adoption of UNECE Regulations or amendments to UNECE Regulations should be adapted to the new procedures set out in Article 218(9) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
(5) The same procedure should also be followed when the Union decides to apply UNECE Regulations to which it had not acceded at the time of its accession to the Revised Agreement, or decides to cease to apply a UNECE Regulation that it has previously accepted.
(6) It is appropriate that the procedure for adopting proposed amendments to the Revised Agreement submitted by the Union, as well as the decision whether to raise an objection to a proposed amendment, be the same as the procedure for the accession to international agreements.
(7) Decision 97/836/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '14.9.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 245/25', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 22 July 2013\namending Decision 97/836/EC with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’)\n(2013/456/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Council Decision 97/836/EC(1), the Union has acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’).\n\n((2)) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)(2)replaced the Member States’ approval systems with a Union approval procedure, establishing a harmonised framework containing the administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 44 and 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (5).
(2) Council Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for the adoption of measures of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, inter alia, by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument with new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (6) concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) The Commission should be empowered to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of Directive 2003/71/EC in order to take account of technical developments in financial markets and ensure the uniform application of that Directive. Those measures are designed to adapt definitions and elaborate upon or supplement the provisions of Directive 2003/71/EC by detailed specification of the form and contents of a prospectus. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2003/71/EC by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) Directive 2003/71/EC provides for a time restriction concerning the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their statement concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament’s wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the co-decision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time limit. The European Parliament and the Council also declared that they would ensure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that provide for a time limit on the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, the provision establishing that time restriction in Directive 2003/71/EC should be deleted.
(6) The Commission should, at regular intervals, evaluate the functioning of the provisions concerning the implementing powers conferred on it in order to allow the European Parliament and the Council to determine whether the extent of those powers and the procedural requirements imposed on the Commission are appropriate and ensure both efficiency and democratic accountability.
(7) Directive 2003/71/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Since the amendments made to Directive 2003/71/EC by this Directive are technical in nature and concern committee procedure only, they do not need to be transposed by the Member States.

","Council Decision
of 25 March 2002
authorising Italy to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to fuels containing biodiesel in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC
(2002/265/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils(1), and in particular Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) As part of a pilot project covering the period 1 July 1998 to 30 June 2001, Italy conducted a trial on the conditions for the use of biodiesel. Exemption from excise duty was granted for a maximum of 125000 tonnes of biodiesel per year. By letter of 23 April 2001, the Italian authorities applied to the Commission for a derogation allowing them to apply an exemption from excise duty on biodiesel and other biofuels in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC, for a period of three years from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2004. In order to obtain the information it required to evaluate the request, the Commission sent additional questions by letters dated 16 May and 8 August 2001, to which the Italian authorities replied on 17 July and 28 September 2001 respectively. A meeting was held between Commission representatives and the Italian authorities on 15 October 2001. A letter from the Italian authorities on 22 October 2001 enabled the Commission to finalise its evaluation of the application for a derogation. Pending approval by the Council of the requested exemption, Italy has suspended the tax reduction scheme.
(2) Italy has applied for a differentiated rate of excise duty to be authorised on biodiesel used as an additive to diesel in quantities of less than 5 % and as a motor fuel mixed with diesel in a proportion of approximately 25 %, mainly for the use of urban service vehicle fleets. In the latter case, in view of the high percentage contained in the mixture, checks should be carried out on the adjustment of engines to the fuel to avoid excessive emission of pollutants.
(3) The other Member States have been notified of this request.
(4) The development of renewable energies and biofuels in particular has been encouraged since 1985 by the Community. Council Directive 85/536/EEC of 5 December 1985 on crude oil savings through the use of substitute fuel components in petrol(2) stresses the role of biofuels in reducing Member States' dependence on oil imports and authorises the incorporation into petrol of up to 5 % of ethanol by volume and up to 15 % of ETBE by volume. Under Council Decisions 93/500/EEC(3) and 98/352/EC(4) and Decision 646/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5), the Altener programme on promoting renewable energies in the Community was adopted with the aim of securing a market share for biofuels of 5 % of total motor vehicle fuel consumption by 2005. The 1997 White Paper on renewable sources of energy further recommended setting an objective of the production of 18 million tonnes of liquid biofuels by 2010 as part of an overall goal of doubling the share of renewables in EU energy consumption by the same year. The Commission's Green Paper ""Towards a European strategy for energy supply security"" stresses the key role of tax instruments in achieving these aims by reducing the difference in cost price between biofuels and competing products. Lastly, on 7 November 2001, the Commission adopted an action plan and two proposals for directives on encouraging the use of substitute fuels in the transport sector, starting with regulatory and tax measures designed to promote biofuels.
(5) The derogations requested by the Italian authorities are therefore in line with the Community's policy of developing the biofuel sector, in the interests of protecting the environment and ensuring security of energy supply.
(6) The reductions in excise duty proposed by Italy are proportional to the percentage of biofuel contained in the final product. Moreover, the effective rates of excise duty are higher than the applicable Community minimum rates, in accordance with Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties on mineral oils(6):
>TABLE>
(7) The Italian programme is of a limited duration of three years. An annual quota of 300000 tonnes of biodiesel will be eligible for the differentiated rate of excise duty.
(8) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or hinder the operation of the internal market and are not incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment, energy and transport,","{'title': '2002/265/EC: Council Decision of 25 March 2002 authorising Italy to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to fuels containing biodiesel in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 1 November 2007 the company Kaneka Pharma Europe made a request to the competent authorities of Belgium to place flavonoids from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Glavonoid) on the market as novel food ingredient.
(2) On 3 December 2008 the competent authority for food assessment of Belgium issued the initial assessment report. In that report it came to the conclusion that the company Kaneka provided sufficient information to authorise the placing on the market of flavonoids from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. as a novel food ingredient.
(3) The Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States on 19 February 2009.
(4) Within the 60-day period laid down in Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 reasoned objections to the marketing of the product were raised in accordance with that provision.
(5) Therefore the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was consulted on 22 July 2009.
(6) On 30 June 2011, EFSA in the ‘Scientific opinion on the safety of “Glavonoid®”, an extract derived from the roots of or rootstock of Glycyrrhiza glabra L., as a novel food ingredient on request from the European Commission’ (2) came to the conclusion that Glavonoid was safe for the general adult population at an intake of up to 120 mg per day.
(7) In order not to exceed an intake of 120 mg per day of Glavonoid, Kaneka Pharma Europe NV agreed on 11 August 2011 to limit the use of Glavonoid as an ingredient to food supplements and beverages.
(8) On the basis of the scientific assessment, it is established that Glavonoid complies with the criteria laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '26.11.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 313/37', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 24 November 2011\nauthorising the placing on the market of flavonoids fromGlycyrrhiza glabraL. as a novel food ingredient under Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2011) 8362)\n(Only the Dutch and the French texts are authentic)\n(2011/761/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 1 November 2007 the company Kaneka Pharma Europe made a request to the competent authorities of Belgium to place flavonoids fromGlycyrrhiza glabraL.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular Article 4(c) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC of 18 December 1996 establishing Community rules for State aid to the steel industry(1), and in particular Article 6(5) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above(2) and having regard to their comments,
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) By letter dated 20 December 2001, registered as received on 21 December, Italy notified the Commission of planned aid for investments to be carried out by ILVA SpA at its Taranto plant.
(2) By letter dated 18 February 2002, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 6(5) of Commission Decision No 2496/96/ECSC (hereinafter referred to as ""the Steel Aid Code"") in respect of the aid.
(3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid.
(4) By letter dated 12 April 2002, registered as received on 17 April, Italy informed the Commission that, in view of the deadline of 22 July imposed by the Steel Aid Code for payment of the aid, ILVA SpA had waived the second and third instalments of the aid. It also informed the Commission that the company had decided that five of the 13 projects included in the original notification would not be carried out and that therefore no aid would be granted for them. The projects were described in paragraphs 8, 9, 13, 14 and 16 of the Decision to initiate proceedings. In the same letter, Italy submitted additional information on the remaining projects.
(5) By letter dated 18 April 2002, the United Kingdom Steel Association submitted comments on the aid. The Commission forwarded them to Italy, which was given the opportunity to react. Its comments were received by letter dated 22 May 2002.
II. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE AID
(6) ILVA SpA is a producer of steel belonging to the Riva Group.
(7) The aid is granted by the Ministry of Industry and Trade under Law No 488/92 for aid in depressed areas (""Converting and amending Decree Law No 415 of 22 October 1992 amending Law No 64 of 1 March 1986 containing an organic framework for extraordinary aid to the Mezzogiorno and rules for subsidising production activities""). The aid was approved on 9 April 2001, subject to authorisation by the Commission.
(8) Following the partial withdrawal of the notification referred to in recital 4, the costs considered eligible for aid by the Italian authorities amount to EUR 20225000. The aid granted under Law No 488/92 is calculated not on the basis of a fixed percentage of eligible costs but on the basis of a percentage expressed as the net grant equivalent (nge) within the limits of the maximum aid approved by the Commission for the aid scheme in question, according to the size of the firm and the location of the production unit. In the specific case of ILVA SpA, the percentage approved by Italy was 12,25 % nge, corresponding to EUR 3034000 to be paid in three instalments. However, because the company has waived the last two instalments, only one instalment will be paid. Therefore, the actual aid will amount to EUR 980000 and will concern the following projects.
(9) Treatment of by-products in the coking plant; refurbishment of the three existing lines for the absorption of ammonia and the refrigeration of coking gas: these lines were completely renovated in 1991. Their remaining useful life at the time of the investment is more than 15 years. The total cost relates to necessary equipment and amounts to EUR 3100000. Of this amount, EUR 800000 has been considered as maintenance costs. The eligible costs amount therefore to EUR 2300000.
(10) Replacement of the existing dust filtration system, which uses cyclones or electrostatic precipitators, by a new system that uses fabric: the statutory maximum level of emissions is 100 mg/Nmc. With this system, the level of dust in the smoke will fall from 50 mg/Nmc to 30 mg/Nmc, i.e. a reduction of 40 %. The existing system dates from the early 1970s and its remaining useful life at the time of the investment is 15 years. The eligible costs relate to necessary equipment and amount to EUR 1292000.
(11) Installation of a system for monitoring the emissions of the coke ovens and sintering plant: this is required by the regional authorities. The cost of the equipment amounts to EUR 1033000.
(12) Installation of a conveyor belt for the transportation of mineral to the homogenisation plant: this system will replace the transportation by lorry currently used. Dust emissions will be eliminated. The total cost of the project amounts to EUR 4700000. According to the Italian authorities, this investment will result in cost savings of EUR 312000 per year. They have deducted EUR 2500000 as cost savings over 10 years. Costs considered eligible by the Italian authorities amount therefore to EUR 2200000.
(13) Installation of a new additional system for the regeneration of hydrochloric acid (Ruthner plant): this system (closed-circuit) will be added to the existing one which dates from 1978 and its remaining useful life at the time of the investment is 10 years. The statutory maximum level of emissions is 60 mg/Nmc. The concentration of hydrochloric acid in the smoke will fall from 55 mg/Nmc to 22 mg/NMC. Moreover, since it is a closed-circuit system, the pollutants contained in the water will no longer pass into the sewage. The cost of the equipment amounts to EUR 1550000.
(14) Improvement of the dust removal system for secondary emissions in blast furnace No 1: this installation dates from 1988 and its remaining useful life at the time of the investment is 12 years. The statutory maximum level of emissions is 100 mg/Nmc. The dust concentration will fall from 50 mg/Nmc to 30 mg/Nmc. The cost of the equipment amounts to EUR 1550000, from which EUR 500000 has been deducted for costs not directly relating to environmental protection. Eligible costs amount therefore to EUR 1050000.
(15) Extension of landfill for special waste by 300000 m2: the waste is currently transported to special landfills outside the company's premises. This investment would eliminate the risks inherent in transporting the waste. According to the Italian authorities, this investment will reduce the costs of transporting and discharging the waste from EUR 70 per tonne/year to EUR 15 per tonne/year. The capacity of this extension is 60000 tonnes per year. The investment amounts to EUR 1290000.
(16) Replacement of 350 PCB electric transformers with new transformers cooled using air or mineral oil: under Italian law, PCB transformers must be dismantled by 2010. These transformers were installed in the 1960s and 1970s. Their remaining useful life is over 20 years. No cost savings are generated by this investment. The investment amounts to EUR 9510000.
III. COMMENTS BY INTERESTED PARTIES
(17) The United Kingdom Steel Association expressed doubts about the environmental purpose of the investments referred to in recitals 11, 13 and 15. With respect to the investments referred to in recitals 10 and 16, it asked the Commission to ensure that they were not being undertaken simply because the existing equipment had reached the end of its normal life. With respect to the investments referred to in recitals 9, 12, 14 and 16, it considered that these are likely to result in cost savings that should be deducted from the eligible costs.
IV. COMMENTS BY ITALY
(18) Since the Commission's doubts arose mainly from the lack of information contained in the notification, the Italian authorities simply provided the missing information.
V. ASSESSMENT OF THE AID
(19) ILVA SpA manufactures products listed in Annex I to the ECSC Treaty. It is therefore an undertaking within the meaning of Article 80 of that Treaty to which the Steel Aid Code applies.
(20) Article 3 of the Steel Aid Code stipulates that steel companies may receive aid for environmental investments. The criteria for assessing whether such aid is compatible with the common market are set out in the Annex to the Steel Aid Code and in the Community guidelines on State aid for environmental protection(4) (hereinafter ""the 1994 environmental guidelines"").
(21) According to the 1994 environmental guidelines, aid ostensibly intended for environmental protection measures but which, in fact, is aid for general investment is not covered by the guidelines. The eligible costs must be strictly confined to the extra investment costs necessary to meet environmental objectives(5). Also according to these guidelines, aid to help firms adapt to new mandatory standards plant that has been in operation for at least two years can be authorised up to the level of 15 % gross of the eligible costs (point A, first paragraph) and aid for investment which will allow the firm to improve on mandatory standards or which is undertaken in the absence of standards may be authorised up to 30 % gross of the eligible costs (point B, first paragraph).
(22) According to the Annex to the Steel Aid Code, the Commission will analyse the economic and environmental background to a decision to opt for replacement of existing plant or equipment. In principle, a decision to undertake new investment which would have been necessary in any event on economic grounds or on account of the age of the existing plant or equipment (remaining useful life of less than 25 %) will not be eligible for aid. Furthermore, any advantage in terms of lower production costs will be deducted.
(23) With respect to the replacement investments referred to in recitals 10, 13, 14 and 16, given in particular that they will not affect the production installations and that their remaining useful life is more than 25 %, the Commission considers that they are environmental investments.
(24) With respect to the investment relating to the treatment of by-products in the coking line (see recital 9), given that the gases will be reintegrated within the network and reused by the company, the Commission considers that this may be the main purpose of the investment. The Italian authorities claim that there are no cost savings generated by this investment. This contradicts, however, their statement that emissions will be reduced in quantity and in quality by 20 % (for which, moreover, they have not provided evidence). The Commission cannot therefore conclude that the investment will significantly improve on environmental protection, as required by the 1994 environmental guidelines. Moreover, no cost savings have been deducted from the eligible costs. In these circumstances, the Commission's doubts as to whether the investment is eligible for environmental aid have not been allayed.
(25) With respect to the investment concerning the installation of a conveyor belt (see recital 12), given the cost savings generated and the limited impact in terms of environmental protection, the Commission considers that it has been undertaken for economic reasons and that it is not, therefore, eligible for aid. In any case, even deducting the cost savings generated would lead to the same conclusion, i.e. non-eligibility for aid.
(26) With respect to the investment concerning the extension of the landfill for special waste (see recital 15), the Commission notes that it will not lead to a reduction in pollution but rather to a reduction in the costs of dealing with the waste. Indeed, the cost reductions will compensate amply for the investment. In these circumstances, the Commission considers that this investment is undertaken more for economic reasons and that it is not, therefore, eligible for aid. In any case, even deducting the cost savings generated would lead to the same conclusion, i.e. non-eligibility for aid.
(27) With respect to the investment concerning the installation of a system for monitoring the emissions of the coke ovens and sintering plant (see recital 11), the Commission notes that, although it is intended to comply with the legal obligations imposed by the regional authorities, it is equipment intended not to reduce or eliminate pollution and nuisances or to adapt production methods (as required by point 3.2.1. of the 1994 environmental guidelines) but merely to measure actual pollution levels. In these circumstances, the investment is not eligible for environmental aid.
(28) With respect to the investment concerning the replacement of electric transformers (see recital 16), the Commission notes that the new equipment is intended to comply with new legal obligations and that it will reduce or eliminate pollution. Therefore, according to point 3.2.A of the 1994 environmental guidelines, the maximum aid for this investment is 15 % gross of the eligible costs, i.e. EUR 1426500.
(29) With respect to the investments described in recitals 10, 13 and 14, the Commission notes that they will allow for significantly higher levels of environmental protection and that the cost savings generated by them have been deducted. According to point 3.2.B of the 1994 environmental guidelines, the maximum aid for these investments is 30 % gross of the eligible costs, i.e. EUR 1167600.
(30) The Table below gives a summary of the eligible costs and of the maximum aid allowed under the 1994 environmental guidelines:
>TABLE>
(31) In these circumstances, given that the aid will consist only of the first instalment of the approved aid, i.e. EUR 980000 (see recital 8), the aid intensity is in conformity with the Steel Aid Code.
VI. CONCLUSION
(32) In view of the foregoing, the State aid amounting to EUR 980000 that Italy intends to grant to ILVA SpA under Law No 488/92 for the projects referred to in recital 30 is compatible with the common market. With respect to the rest of the notified aid, in view of the withdrawal of the notification (see recital 4), the procedure initiated on 18 February 2002 is closed,","{'title': '2003/107/ECSC: Commission Decision of 17 July 2002 on the State aid which Italy is planning to implement for ILVA SpA (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 2595)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe State aid amounting to EUR 980000 which Italy plans to implement under Law No 488/92 for ILVA SpA in respect of projects to be carried out at its Taranto plant is compatible with the common market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 17 July 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario Monti\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 338, 28.12.1996, p. 42.\n\n(2) OJ C 71, 20.3.2002, p. 6.\n\n(3) See footnote 2.\n\n(4) OJ C 72, 10.3.1994, p. 3.\n\n(5) See point 3.2.1 of the guidelines.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 January 2005 laying down requirements for feed hygiene (1), and in particular Article 27(b) and (f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 lays down general rules on feed hygiene, conditions and arrangements to ensure that processing conditions to minimise and control potential hazards are respected. Feed business establishments are to be registered with or approved by the competent authority. Additionally, feed business operators lower down the feed chain have the obligation to source feed only from establishments which are registered or approved.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed (2) requires feed placed on the market to be safe and explicitly labelled with the respective type of feed. Additionally, Commission Regulation (EU) No 575/2011 of 16 June 2011 on the Catalogue of feed materials (3) lists detailed descriptions for specific feed materials to be used for labelling purposes.
(3) The interplay of these requirements should ensure traceability and a high level of consumer protection throughout the feed and food chain.
(4) Official controls and controls carried out by feed business operators have shown that certain oils and fats and products derived thereof not intended for feed use have been used as feed materials resulting in feed exceeding the maximum dioxin levels laid down in Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (4). As a consequence, food derived from animals fed with contaminated feed may pose a public health risk. In addition, financial losses may result from the withdrawal of contaminated feed and food from the market.
(5) To enhance feed hygiene and without prejudice to the competence of the Member States as laid down in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 183/2005, establishments further processing crude vegetable oils, manufacturing products derived from oils of vegetable origin and blending fats should be subject to approval in accordance with that Regulation if these products are intended for use in feed.
(6) Specific requirements for the production, labelling, storage and transport of those feed materials should be provided for to take into account the experience gained from the application of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP)-based systems.
(7) A reinforced dioxin monitoring would facilitate the detection of non-compliances and the enforcement of feed law. It is necessary to provide for an obligation for feed business operators to test fats, oils and products derived thereof for dioxin and dioxin-like PCBs in order to reduce the risk that contaminated products enter the food chain and, therefore, support the strategy to reduce the exposure to dioxin of EU citizens. The risk of dioxin contamination should be the basis for the establishment of the monitoring plan. The responsibility to place safe feed on the market is with the feed business operators. Thus the costs for the analysis should be fully borne by them. Detailed provisions on sampling and analysis not contained in this Regulation should remain within the competence of the Member States. Furthermore, Member States are encouraged to focus on the controls of feed business operators that are not under the scope of the dioxin monitoring but that obtain the products mentioned above.
(8) The mandatory risk-based monitoring system must not affect the feed business operator’s duty to comply with the requirements of Union legislation on feed hygiene. It should be integrated into good hygiene practices and the HACCP-based system. This should be verified by the competent authority in the context of the approval of the feed business operator. The operator’s regular review of his own risk assessment should consider the findings of the dioxin monitoring.
(9) Laboratories performing dioxin analyses should be obliged to report results exceeding the maximum permitted limits provided for in Directive 2002/32/EC not only to the feed business operator but also to the competent authority in order to improve transparency; this obligation does not exempt the feed business operator from his obligation to inform the competent authority.
(10) In order to verify the effectiveness of the provisions concerning the mandatory dioxin monitoring and its integration in the feed business operators HACCP system, a review after two years should be provided for.
(11) Sufficient time should be allowed to give competent authorities and feed business operators the possibility to adapt to the provisions of this Regulation.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,","{'header': '16.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 77/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 225/2012\nof 15 March 2012\namending Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the approval of establishments placing on the market, for feed use, products derived from vegetable oils and blended fats and as regards the specific requirements for production, storage, transport and dioxin testing of oils, fats and products derived thereof\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 lays down general rules on feed hygiene, conditions and arrangements to ensure that processing conditions to minimise and control potential hazards are respected.

After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the Flemish Government has submitted to the Commission on 22 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Turnhout; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under  this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the Flemish authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;

Whereas, owing to the imbalance on the market for bitter varieties Regulation (EEC) No 2997/87 (2) provides for special measures for certain regions where production mainly comprises such varieties; whereas the imbalance persisting on the market for bitter varieties calls for the adoption of a measure enabling structures in regions involved in the production of bitter varieties to be modified by conversion to varieties more sought after on the market;
Whereas, in view of the market situation, the extension of the special aid provided for in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2997/87 for varietal conversion of any area under bitter varieties to aromatic or super-alpha varieties appears to be a suitable measure;
Whereas, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the measures contemplated, the time limit by which conversion plans may be implemented should be extended; whereas the overall trend on the market makes it possible to delete the provision limiting areas which may be cultivated by producer groups qualifying for the special aid,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1809/89 of 19 June 1989 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2997/87 laying down, in respect of hops, the amount of aid to producers for the 1986 harvest and providing for special measures for certain regions of production', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2997/87 is hereby amended as follows:', 'text': ""Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2997/87 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.

(2) Point 4 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of rapid tests approved for the monitoring of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.
(3) On 8 May 2012, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published an opinion on the evaluation of new TSE rapid tests submitted in the framework of the Commission call for expression of interest 2007/S204-247339 (2).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 886/2002(4), stipulates that certain CN codes are to apply only to imported products originating in and coming from Switzerland. Classification in CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 requires compliance with a minimum free-at-frontier value if imports into the Community are to qualify for a preferential duty rate. Since from 1 June 2002, the date of entry into force of the bilateral agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning trade in agricultural products, signed in Luxembourg on 21 June 1999 and approved by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom of the Council and of the Commission(5), eligibility for the preferential duty rate is no longer subject to compliance with a minimum free-at-frontier value, and since the cheeses covered by those codes are now imported under CN codes 0406 90 13 to 0406 90 17, as listed in Annex II(D) to Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 are no longer required. In order to avoid confusing importers and customs authorities, and pending the deletion of those codes from the Combined Nomenclature, the said Article should be adjusted and transitional rules adopted for licences issued before the date of entry into force of the agreement with Switzerland.
(2) Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 stipulates that importers may lodge only one licence application each for the same quota in the integrated tariff of the European Communities (TARIC). The quota numbers listed in Annexes I(B)(2) and I(B)(3) to that Regulation for products originating in the Czech Republic and Slovakia are identical, since those two countries were previously one country. It should therefore be specified that the quotas concerned must be considered as separate quotas.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas units of measurement are essential in the use of all measuring instruments, to express measurements or any indication of quantity ; whereas units of measurement are used in most fields of human activity ; whereas it is necessary to ensure the greatest possible clarity in their use ; whereas it is therefore necessary to make rules for their use within the Community for economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes;
Whereas, however, there exist international conventions or agreements in the field of international transport which bind the Community or the Member States ; whereas these conventions or agreements have to be respected;
Whereas the laws which regulate the use of units of measurement in the Member States differ from one Member State to another and as a result hinder trade ; whereas, in these circumstances, it is necessary to harmonize laws, regulations and administrative provisions in order to overcome such obstacles;
Whereas units of measurement are the subject of international resolutions adopted by the General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) set up by the Metre Convention signed in Paris on 20 May 1875, to which all the Member States adhere ; whereas the ""International System of Units"" (SI) was drawn up as a result of these resolutions;
Whereas the Council on 18 October 1971 adopted Directive 71/354/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States in order to eliminate obstacles to trade by adopting the international system of units at Community level ; whereas Directive 71/354/EEC was amended by the Act of Accession and by Directive 76/770/EEC;
Whereas these Community provisions have not overcome all the obstacles in this field ; whereas Directive 76/770/EEC provides for the review before 31 December 1979 of the situation regarding units of measurement, names and symbols listed in Chapter D of the Annex thereto ; whereas it has also proved necessary to review the situation regarding certain other units of measurement;
Whereas it is necessary, in order to avoid serious difficulties, to provide for a transitional period during which units of measurement which are not compatible with the international system can be phased out ; whereas it is nevertheless essential to allow the Member States wishing to do so to bring into force as quickly as possible, on their territory, the provisions of Chapter I of the Annex ; whereas it is therefore necessary to limit the duration of this transitional period at Community level while, at the same time, leaving the Member States free to curtail that period;
Whereas, during the transitional period, it is essential, particularly in order to protect the consumer, to maintain a clear position on the use of units of measurement in trade between the Member States ; whereas the obligation on the Member States to allow use of supplementary indications on products and equipment imported from other Member States during this transitional period seems to serve this purpose well;  (1)OJ No L 243, 29.10.1971, p. 29.

Whereas the systematic adoption of a solution of this kind for all measuring instruments, including medical instruments, is however not necessarily desirable ; whereas the Member States should therefore be able to require that, on their territory, measuring instruments bear indications of quantity in a single legal unit of measurement;
Whereas this Directive does not affect the continued manufacture of products already on the market ; whereas it does, however, affect the placing on the market and use of products and equipment bearing indications of quantity in units of measurement which are no longer legal units of measurement, when such products and equipment are necessary to supplement or replace components or parts of such products, equipment and instruments already on the market ; whereas it is therefore necessary for Member States to authorize the placing on the market and the use of such products and equipment to complete and replace components, even when they bear indications of quantity in units of measurement which are no longer legal units of measurement, so that products, equipment or instruments already on the market may continue to be used;
Whereas the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) on 1 March 1974 adopted an international standard on the representation of SI and other units for use in systems with limited sets of characters ; whereas it is advisable for the Community to adopt the solutions which have already been approved on a wider international level by ISO Standard 2955 of 1 March 1974;
Whereas Community provisions relating to units of measurement are to be found in several Community texts ; whereas the question of units of measurement is so important that it is essential that reference may be made to a single Community text ; whereas this Directive thereby consolidates all the Community provisions on the subject and repeals Directive 71/354/EEC,","{'title': 'Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and on the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe legal units of measurement within the meaning of this Directive which must be used for expressing quantities shall be:    (a) those listed in Chapter I of the Annex;\n\n(b) those listed in Chapter II of the Annex, until a date to be fixed by the Member States ; this date may not be later than 31 December 1985;\n\n(c) those listed in Chapter III of the Annex only in those Member States where they were authorized on 21 April 1973 and until a date to be fixed by those Member States ; this date may not be later than a date to be set by the Council before 31 December 1989 on the basis of Article 100 of the Treaty.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n(a) The obligations arising under Article 1 relate to measuring instruments used, measurements made and indications of quantity expressed in units of measurement, for economic, public health, public safety or administrative purposes.\n\n(b) This Directive shall not affect the use in the field of air and sea transport and rail traffic of units, other than those made compulsory by the Directive, which have been laid down in international conventions or agreements binding the Community or the Member States.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

","Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 18 December 2000
on unbundled access to the local loop
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) The conclusions of the European Council of Lisbon of 23 and 24 March 2000 note that, for Europe to fully seize the growth and job potential of the digital, knowledge-based economy, businesses and citizens must have access to an inexpensive, world-class communications infrastructure and a wide range of services. The Member States, together with the Commission, are called upon to work towards introducing greater competition in local access networks before the end of 2000 and unbundling the local loop, in order to help bring about a substantial reduction in the costs of using the Internet. The Feira European Council of 20 June 2000 endorsed the proposed ""e-Europe"" Action Plan which identifies unbundled access to the local loop as a short-term priority.
(2) Local loop unbundling should complement the existing provisions in Community law guaranteeing universal service and affordable access for all citizens by enhancing competition, ensuring economic efficiency and bringing maximum benefit to users.
(3) The ""local loop"" is the physical twisted metallic pair circuit in the fixed public telephone network connecting the network termination point at the subscriber's premises to the main distribution frame or equivalent facility. As noted in the Commission's Fifth Report on the implementation of the telecommunications regulatory package, the local access network remains one of the least competitive segments of the liberalised telecommunications market. New entrants do not have widespread alternative network infrastructures and are unable, with traditional technologies, to match the economies of scale and the coverage of operators designated as having significant market power in the fixed public telephone network market. This results from the fact that these operators rolled out their metallic local access infrastructures over significant periods of time protected by exclusive rights and were able to fund investment costs through monopoly rents.
(4) The European Parliament Resolution of 13 June 2000 on the Commission communication on the 1999 Communications review stresses the importance of enabling the sector to develop infrastructures which promote the growth of electronic communications and e-commerce and the importance of regulating in a way that supports this growth. It notes that the unbundling of the local loop currently concerns mainly the metallic infrastructure of a dominant entity and that investment in alternative infrastructures must have the possibility of ensuring a reasonable rate of return, since that might facilitate the expansion of these infrastructures in areas where their penetration is still low.
(5) The provision of new loops with high capacity optical fibre directly to major users is a specific market that is developing under competitive conditions with new investments. This Regulation therefore addresses access to metallic local loops, without prejudice to national obligations regarding other types of access to local infrastructures.
(6) It would not be economically viable for new entrants to duplicate the incumbent's metallic local access infrastructure in its entirety within a reasonable time. Alternative infrastructures such as cable television, satellite, wireless local loops do not generally offer the same functionality or ubiquity for the time being, though situations in Member States may differ.
(7) Unbundled access to the local loop allows new entrants to compete with notified operators in offering high bit-rate data transmission services for continuous Internet access and for multimedia applications based on digital subscriber line (DSL) technology as well as voice telephony services. A reasonable request for unbundled access implies that the access is necessary for the provision of the services of the beneficiary, and that refusal of the request would prevent, restrict or distort competition in this sector.
(8) This Regulation mandates unbundled access to the metallic local loops only of notified operators that have been designated by their national regulatory authorities as having significant market power in the fixed public telephone network supply market under the relevant Community provisions (hereinafter referred to as ""notified operators""). Member States have already notified to the Commission the names of those fixed public network operators which have significant market power under Annex I, Part 1, of Directive 97/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1997 on interconnection in telecommunications with regard to ensuring universal service and interoperability through application of the principles of open network provision (ONP)(3), and Directive 98/10/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 1998 on the application of open network provision to voice telephony and on universal service for telecommunications in a competitive environment(4).
(9) A notified operator cannot be required to provide types of access which are not within its powers to provide, for example where fulfilment of a request would cause a violation of the legal rights of an independent third party. The obligation to provide unbundled access to the local loop does not imply that notified operators have to install entirely new local network infrastructure specifically to meet beneficiaries' requests.
(10) Although commercial negotiation is the preferred method for reaching agreement on technical and pricing issues for local loop access, experience shows that in most cases regulatory intervention is necessary due to imbalance in negotiating power between the new entrant and the notified operator, and lack of other alternatives. In certain circumstances the national regulatory authority may, in accordance with Community law, intervene on its own initiative in order to ensure fair competition, economic efficiency and maximum benefit for end-users. Failure of the notified operator to meet lead times should entitle the beneficiary to receive compensation.
(11) Costing and pricing rules for local loops and related facilities should be transparent, non-discriminatory and objective to ensure fairness. Pricing rules should ensure that the local loop provider is able to cover its appropriate costs in this regard plus a reasonable return, in order to ensure the long term development and upgrade of local access infrastructure. Pricing rules for local loops should foster fair and sustainable competition, bearing in mind the need for investment in alternative infrastructures, and ensure that there is no distortion of competition, in particular no margin squeeze between prices of wholesale and retail services of the notified operator. In this regard, it is considered important that competition authorities be consulted.
(12) Notified operators should provide information and unbundled access to third parties under the same conditions and of the same quality as they provide for their own services or to their associated companies. To this end, the publication by the notified operator of an adequate reference offer for unbundled access to the local loop, within a short time-frame and ideally on the Internet, and under the supervisory control of the national regulatory authority, would contribute to the creation of transparent and non-discriminatory market conditions.
(13) In its Recommendation 2000/417/EC of 25 May 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop enabling the competitive provision of a full range of electronic communications services including broadband multimedia and high-speed Internet(5) and its Communication of 26 April 2000(6), the Commission set out detailed guidance to assist national regulatory authorities on the fair regulation of different forms of unbundled access to the local loop.
(14) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of achieving a harmonised framework for unbundled access to the local loop in order to enable the competitive provision of an inexpensive, world-class communications infrastructure and a wide range of services for all businesses and citizens in the Community cannot be achieved by the Member States in a secure, harmonised and timely manner and can therefore be better achieved by the Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, the provisions of this Regulation do not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective for that purpose. They are adopted without prejudice to national provisions complying with Community law which set out more detailed measures, for example dealing with virtual collocation.
(15) This Regulation complements the regulatory framework for telecommunications, in particular Directives 97/33/EC and 98/10/EC. The new regulatory framework for electronic communications should include appropriate provisions to replace this Regulation,","{'title': 'Regulation (EC) No 2887/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on unbundled access to the local loop (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAim and Scope\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’) and in particular Articles 16(4) and 24(5) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission has received a request, pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, to make imports of wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems originating in the People’s Republic of China subject to registration.
A.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(2) The product concerned by this registration is wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems with a radio antenna and providing Internet Protocol (IP) data connectivity for computing devices and including Wi-Fi routers comprising a WWAN modem (WWAN/Wi-Fi routers), originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the product concerned’), currently falling within CN codes ex 8471 80 00 and ex 8517 62 00.
B.   REQUEST
(3) Having received a complaint from Option NV (hereinafter ‘the applicant’), the Commission determined that there is sufficient evidence to justify initiation of a proceeding and therefore, pursuant to Article 10 of the basic Regulation, announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union (the ‘Notice of Initiation’) the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems originating in the People’s Republic of China.
(4) Concerning standing to lodge a complaint, the applicant is the sole producer of the product concerned in the European Union, representing 100 % of the total Union production.
(5) As regards the existence of alleged countervailable subsidisation, the complainant has provided the European Commission with evidence of specific subsidy programmes regarding preferential loans, income tax preferential rates, benefits from establishment in free trade zones, indirect tax and import tariff programmes, grant programmes, preferential rate for government provision of goods and services and preferential policies at the level of local government.
(6) The applicant also requests that imports of the product concerned are made subject to registration pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration.
C.   GROUNDS FOR THE REGISTRATION
(7) According to Article 12(1) of the basic Regulation, provisional measures may not be imposed earlier than 60 days from initiation. However, according to Article 16(4) of the basic Regulation, a definitive countervailing duty may be levied on products which were entered for consumption not more than 90 days prior to the date of application of provisional measures, provided that the conditions set out in that paragraph are fulfilled, and imports have been registered in accordance with Article 24(5). According to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, direct the customs authorities to take the appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports may be made subject to registration following a request from the Union industry which contains sufficient evidence to justify such action.
(8) The request contains sufficient evidence to justify registration.
(9) The alleged subsidies consist, inter alia, of income tax programmes (e.g. income tax exemptions or reductions under the two free/three half programme, income tax reductions for high or new technology industries, income tax credits for domestically owned companies purchasing domestically produced equipment), indirect tax and import tariff programmes (e.g. value-added tax (‘VAT’) and tariff exemptions on imported equipment), preferential lending schemes (e.g. policy loans including export financing from State-owned commercial banks and government policy banks), grant programmes (e.g. the Development Fund for the Electronics and Information Industry (‘IT Fund’), the state key technologies renovation project fund, famous brands awards), government provision of goods and services for less than adequate numeration (e.g. provision of land use rights) as well as of local government preferential policies, including benefits in special zones and industrial parks (e.g. preferential policies in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Beijing, Xian).
(10) It is alleged that the above schemes are subsidies since they involve a financial contribution from the Government of the People’s Republic of China or other regional Governments (including public bodies) and confer a benefit to the recipients, i.e. to the exporting producers of the product under investigation. They are alleged to be contingent upon export performance and/or upon the use of domestic over imported goods and/or limited to certain enterprises or groups of enterprises and/or products and/or regions, and therefore specific and countervailable.
(11) The request provides sufficient evidence of critical circumstances where for the subsidised product in question injury which is difficult to repair is caused by massive imports benefiting from countervailable subsidies in a relatively short period of time. Evidence of such circumstances include the rapid nature of the deterioration of the situation of the Union industry, the fact that a single producer exists in the Union and the significant amount of R & D expenses that must be undertaken to generate the product concerned. Against this background, the complainant has provided evidence that imports of the product under investigation from the country concerned have increased significantly overall in absolute terms and in terms of market share. As regards the injury caused by these massive imports, the evidence provided by the complainant shows that the volume and the prices of the imported product under investigation have, among other consequences, had a negative impact on the quantities sold, the level of the prices charged and the market share held by the Union industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance, the financial situation and the employment situation of the Union industry. It follows that the Commission has at its disposal sufficient evidence that, in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury, it may be necessary to assess countervailing duties retroactively.
(12) Accordingly, the conditions for registration in this case are met.
D.   PROCEDURE
(13) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that the applicant’s request contains sufficient evidence to make imports of the product concerned subject to registration, in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.
(14) All interested parties are invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
E.   REGISTRATION
(15) Pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned (2) should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings leading to the imposition of countervailing duties, those duties, can, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, be levied retroactively in accordance with applicable legal provisions.
(16) Any future liability would emanate from the findings of the anti-subsidy investigation. It is not possible to give an estimated amount of possible future liability since this will depend on the amount of countervailable subsidies found to exist and the manner in which they would need to be allocated to the product under investigation.
F.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(17) Any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3),","{'header': '16.9.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 243/37', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 811/2010\nof 15 September 2010\nmaking imports of wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems originating in the People’s Republic of China subject to registration in application of Article 24(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Commission has received a request, pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, to make imports of wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems originating in the People’s Republic of China subject to registration.', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Union of wireless wide area networking (WWAN) modems with a radio antenna and providing Internet Protocol (IP) data connectivity for computing devices and including Wi-Fi routers comprising a WWAN modem (WWAN/Wi-Fi routers) originating in the People’s Republic of China, currently falling within CN codes ex\xa08471\xa080\xa000 and ex\xa08517\xa062\xa000 (TARIC codes 8471800010, 8517620011 and 8517620091).

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) It is desirable to introduce into Council Directive 74/60/EEC(4), requirements concerning power-operated windows with the aim of eliminating the danger to children, which can occur when closing these windows; similar requirements should also apply to power-operated roof panel systems and partition systems; for this purpose the title and the scope of Directive 74/60/EEC should be amended accordingly.
(2) Directive 74/60/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval procedure which has been established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers(5); consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 70/156/EEC relating to vehicles, vehicle systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 74/60/EEC.
(3) In particular, Articles 3(4) and 4(3) of Directive 70/156/EEC require that each separate Directive has attached to it an information document incorporating the relevant items of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC and also a type-approval certificate based on Annex VI to Directive 70/156/EEC in order that type-approval may be computerised.
(4) It is important that vehicles in categories other than M1, in particular those in categories M2 and N1, are able at the earliest opportunity to afford the driver and passengers, more particularly children, the level of safety provided by Directive 74/60/EEC; to that end it should be made possible for the scope of Directive 74/60/EEC to be extended to cover such vehicles in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC.
(5) The amendments to Directive 74/60/EEC relate only to its administrative provisions and to power-operated windows, roof panel and/or partition systems; it is not necessary therefore to invalidate existing approvals granted under Directive 74/60/EEC nor to prevent the registration, sale and entry into service of new vehicles, which are not fitted with power-operated windows, roof panel and/or partition systems and which are covered by such approvals.
(6) In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty, the measures contained in this Directive do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaty,","{'title': 'Directive 2000/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 February 2000 amending Council Directive 74/60/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the interior fittings of motor vehicles (interior parts of the passenger compartment other than the interior rear-view mirrors, layout of controls, the roof or sliding roof, the backrest and rear part of the seats)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDirective 74/60/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

After such an auto-reversal, the window or roof panel or partition shall open to one of the following positions:\n\n5.8.3.1.2.1. a position that permits a semi-rigid cylindrical rod of a diameter of 200 mm to be placed through the opening at the same contact point(s) used to determine the reversing behaviour in Item 5.8.3.1.1;\n\n5.8.3.1.2.2. a position that represents at least the initial position before closing was initiated;\n\n5.8.3.1.2.3. a position at least 50 mm more open than the position at the time when reversing was initiated;\n\n5.8.3.1.2.4. in the case of tilting motion of a roof panel, the maximum angular opening.\n\n5.8.3.1.3. To check power-operated windows/roof-panel systems/partition systems with reversing devices, a measuring instrument/test rod shall be placed through the opening from the inside of the vehicle or, in the case of a partition system, from the rear part of the passenger compartment in such a way that the cylindrical surface of the rod contacts any part of the vehicle structure which forms the boundary of the window/roof-panel aperture/partition. The force deflection ratio of the measuring instrument shall be not more than 10 N/mm. The position of the test rods (normally located perpendicular to the window/roof panel/-partition) are illustrated in Appendix 3, Figure 1.\n\n5.8.4. Switch location and operation\n\n5.8.4.1. Switches of power-operated windows/roof panels/partitions shall be located or operated in such a way to minimise the risk of accidental closing. The switches shall require continuous actuation for closing except in the case of Items 5.8.2.6, 5.8.2.8 or 5.8.3.\n\n5.8.4.2. All rear-window, roof-panel and partition switches intended for use by occupants in the rear of the vehicle shall be capable of being switched off by a driver-controlled switch which is located forward of a vertical transverse plane passing through the R points of the front seats. The driver controlled switch is not required if a rear window, roof panel or partition is equipped with an auto-reversing device.

(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the anti-dumping measures on imports of steel ropes and cables originating in the People’s Republic of China are being circumvented by means of the transhipment via the Republic of Korea and Malaysia of steel ropes and cables.
(7) The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea and Malaysia to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, and that there is insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change.
(8) This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment of steel ropes and cables originating in the People’s Republic of China via the Republic of Korea and Malaysia.
(9) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures on the product concerned are being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of steel ropes and cables from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned. In addition, there is sufficient evidence that this increased volume of imports is made at prices well below the non-injurious price established in the investigation that led to the existing measures.
(10) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the prices of product under investigation are dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for the product concerned.
(11) Should circumvention practices via the Republic of Korea and Malaysia covered by Article 13 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may also cover these practices.
5.   PROCEDURE
(12) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of steel ropes and cables consigned from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, whether declared as originating in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
5.1.   Questionnaires
(13) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in the People’s Republic of China, to the known importers and to the known associations of importers in the Community and to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and Malaysia. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(14) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(15) The authorities of the People’s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea and Malaysia will be notified of the initiation of the investigation.
5.2.   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(16) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
5.3.   Exemption of registration of imports or measures
(17) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(18) Since the possible circumvention takes place outside the Community, exemptions may be granted, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation, to producers of the product under investigation that can show that they are not related to any producer subject to the measures and that are found not to be engaged in circumvention practices as defined in Articles 13(1) and 13(2) of the basic Regulation. Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should submit a request duly supported by evidence within the time limit indicated in Article 3(3) of this Regulation.
6.   REGISTRATION
(19) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from the Republic of Korea and Malaysia.
7.   TIME LIMITS
(20) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
(21) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party’s making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
8.   NON-COOPERATION
(22) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(23) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
9.   SCHEDULE FOR THE INVESTIGATION
(24) The investigation will be concluded, according to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of the publication of this notice in the Official Journal of the European Union.
10.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(25) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (4).
11.   HEARING OFFICER
(26) It is also noted that if interested parties consider that they are encountering difficulties in the exercise of their rights of defence, they may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of DG Trade. He acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission services, offering, where necessary, mediation on procedural matters affecting the protection of their interests in this proceeding, in particular with regard to issues concerning access to the file, confidentiality, extension of time limits and the treatment of written and/or oral submission of views.

REGULATION (EU) No 1174/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 16 November 2011
on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 136, in combination with Article 121(6) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (3),
Whereas:
(1) The improved economic governance framework should rely on several interlinked and coherent policies for sustainable growth and jobs, in particular a Union strategy for growth and jobs, with particular focus upon developing and strengthening the internal market, fostering international trade and competitiveness, a European Semester for strengthened coordination of economic and budgetary policies, an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive government deficits (the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)), a robust framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks, and enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, including macroprudential supervision by the European Systemic Risk Board.
(2) Reliable statistical data is the basis for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances. In order to guarantee sound and independent statistics, Member States should ensure the professional independence of national statistical authorities, consistent with the European statistics code of practice as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics (4). In addition, the availability of sound fiscal data is also relevant for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances. This requirement should be guaranteed by the rules provided in this regard by Regulation (EU) No 1173/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area (5), in particular its Article 8.
(3) The coordination of the economic policies of the Member States within the Union should be developed in the context of the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines, as provided for by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and should entail compliance with the guiding principles of stable prices, sound and sustainable public finances and monetary conditions and a sustainable balance of payments.
(4) Experience gained and mistakes made during the first decade of the economic and monetary union show a need for improved economic governance in the Union, which should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust framework at the level of the Union for the surveillance of national economic policies.
(5) Achieving and maintaining a dynamic internal market should be considered an element of the proper and smooth functioning of the economic and monetary union.
(6) In particular, surveillance of the economic policies of the Member States should be broadened beyond budgetary surveillance to include a more detailed and formal framework to prevent excessive macroeconomic imbalances and to help the Member States affected to establish corrective plans before divergences become entrenched and before economic and financial developments take a durable turn in an excessively unfavourable direction. Such broadening of the surveillance of economic policies should take place in parallel with a deepening of fiscal surveillance.
(7) To help correct such excessive macroeconomic imbalances, it is necessary to lay down a detailed procedure in legislation.
(8) It is appropriate to supplement the multilateral surveillance procedure referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 121 TFEU with specific rules for the detection of macroeconomic imbalances as well as the prevention and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances within the Union. It is essential that the procedure be embedded in the annual multilateral surveillance cycle.
(9) Strengthening economic governance should include a closer and more timely involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments. While recognising that the counterparts of the European Parliament in the framework of the dialogue are the relevant institutions of the Union and their representatives, the competent committee of the European Parliament may offer an opportunity to participate in an exchange of views to a Member State which is the subject of a Council decision imposing an interest-bearing deposit or an annual fine in accordance with this Regulation. The Member State's participation in such an exchange of views is voluntary.
(10) The Commission should have a stronger role in the enhanced surveillance procedure as regards assessments that are specific to each Member State, monitoring, on-site missions, recommendations and warnings.
(11) Enforcement of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2011 on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances (6) should be strengthened by establishing interest-bearing deposits in case of non-compliance with the recommendation to take corrective action. Such deposits should be converted into an annual fine in the case of continued non-compliance with the recommendation to address excessive macroeconomic imbalances within the same imbalances procedure. Those enforcement measures should be applicable to Member States whose currency is the euro.
(12) In the case of failure to comply with Council recommendations, the interest-bearing deposit or the fine should be imposed until the Council establishes that the Member State has taken corrective action to comply with its recommendations.
(13) Moreover, repeated failure of the Member State to draw up a corrective action plan to address the Council recommendation should also be subject to an annual fine as a rule, until the Council establishes that the Member State has provided a corrective action plan that sufficiently addresses its recommendation.
(14) To ensure equal treatment between Member States, the interest-bearing deposit and the fine should be identical for all Member States whose currency is the euro and equal to 0,1 % of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Member State concerned in the preceding year.
(15) The Commission should be able to recommend reducing the amount of a sanction or cancelling it on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances.
(16) The procedure for applying sanctions to those Member States which fail to take effective measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances should be construed in such a way that the application of the sanctions to those Member States would be the rule and not the exception.
(17) Fines referred to in this Regulation should constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 TFEU, and should be assigned to stability mechanisms to provide financial assistance, created by Member States whose currency is the euro in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole.
(18) The power to adopt individual decisions for the application of the sanctions provided for in this Regulation should be conferred on the Council. As part of the coordination of the economic policies of the Member States conducted within the Council as provided for in Article 121(1) TFEU, those individual decisions are an integral follow-up to the measures adopted by the Council in accordance with Article 121 TFEU and Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011.
(19) Since this Regulation contains general rules for the effective enforcement of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011, it should be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure referred to in Article 121(6) TFEU.
(20) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the effective enforcement of the correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the deep trade and financial interlinks between Member States and the spill-over effects of national economic policies on the Union and the euro area as a whole, and can therefore be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective,","{'header': '23.11.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 306/8', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 1174/2011 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 16 November 2011\non enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The improved economic governance framework should rely on several interlinked and coherent policies for sustainable growth and jobs, in particular a Union strategy for growth and jobs, with particular focus upon developing and strengthening the internal market, fostering international trade and competitiveness, a European Semester for strengthened coordination of economic and budgetary policies, an effective framework for preventing and correcting excessive government deficits (the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)), a robust framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances, minimum requirements for national budgetary frameworks, and enhanced financial market regulation and supervision, including macroprudential supervision by the European Systemic Risk Board.\n\n((2)) Reliable statistical data is the basis for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances.

Those enforcement measures should be applicable to Member States whose currency is the euro.\n\n((12)) In the case of failure to comply with Council recommendations, the interest-bearing deposit or the fine should be imposed until the Council establishes that the Member State has taken corrective action to comply with its recommendations.\n\n((13)) Moreover, repeated failure of the Member State to draw up a corrective action plan to address the Council recommendation should also be subject to an annual fine as a rule, until the Council establishes that the Member State has provided a corrective action plan that sufficiently addresses its recommendation.\n\n((14)) To ensure equal treatment between Member States, the interest-bearing deposit and the fine should be identical for all Member States whose currency is the euro and equal to 0,1\xa0% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Member State concerned in the preceding year.\n\n((15)) The Commission should be able to recommend reducing the amount of a sanction or cancelling it on grounds of exceptional economic circumstances.\n\n((16)) The procedure for applying sanctions to those Member States which fail to take effective measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances should be construed in such a way that the application of the sanctions to those Member States would be the rule and not the exception.\n\n((17)) Fines referred to in this Regulation should constitute other revenue, as referred to in Article 311 TFEU, and should be assigned to stability mechanisms to provide financial assistance, created by Member States whose currency is the euro in order to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole.\n\n((18)) The power to adopt individual decisions for the application of the sanctions provided for in this Regulation should be conferred on the Council. As part of the coordination of the economic policies of the Member States conducted within the Council as provided for in Article 121(1) TFEU, those individual decisions are an integral follow-up to the measures adopted by the Council in accordance with Article 121 TFEU and Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011.\n\n((19)) Since this Regulation contains general rules for the effective enforcement of Regulation (EU) No 1176/2011, it should be adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure referred to in Article 121(6) TFEU.\n\n((20)) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the effective enforcement of the correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the deep trade and financial interlinks between Member States and the spill-over effects of national economic policies on the Union and the euro area as a whole, and can therefore be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.

Whereas, in the cereals and rice sector, the prices to be taken into consideration are the  intervention prices; whereas, however, following the amendments to the intervention arrangements  provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) N° 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization  of the market in cereals(2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 1340/90(3), and in Council  Regulation (EEC) N° 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice(4), as  last amended by Regulation (EEC) N° 1806/89(5), buying-in is to be carried out at a level lower  than the intervention price; whereas that level, which henceforth constitutes the actual guarantee  to the producer, must accordingly serve as the basis for calculating the accession compensatory  amounts;
Whereas, in the case of products processed from cereals, the accession compensatory amounts must be  calculated in accordance with Article 322 (2) of the Act of Accession as rectified(6); whereas the coefficients  should be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 26 of Regulation (EEC)  N° 2727/75;
Whereas a certain amount of deflection of trade and distortion of competition may, in particular,  occur in the final period of price alignment and when common prices are applied throughout the  Community; whereas it is therefore justified that measures intended to prevent such defiection and  distortion should apply for such time as is necessary,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3654/90 of 11 December 1990 laying down general rules for the system of accession compensatory amounts applicable to cereals and rice during the second stage of the accession of Portugal', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation:\n\n'accession compensatory amounts` means compensatory amounts applicable to trade between:\n\nPortugal and the other Member States,\n\nPortugal and third countries.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas because of the outbreak of African swine fever in a production zone in the Netherlands, marketing of live pigs and pigmeat products which have not been subjected to heat treatment is temporarily prohibited in that region; whereas the production region in question has been defined by Commission Decision 86/139/EEC of 4 April 1986, concerning certain protection measures relating to African swine fever in the Netherlands (3), as amended by Decision 86/150/EEC (4);
Whereas, in order to take account of the limitations to free movement resulting from the situation, exceptional measures to support the market in that specific region must be taken;
Whereas the requirements of the heat treatment laid down in Decision 86/139/EEC are likely to seriously impede the disposal of meat produced in the region subject to restrictions on free movement; whereas, in addition, because of the high risk of contamination, such disposal is likely to create difficulties for the disposal of products originating in other regions of the Netherlands; whereas a rapid analysis will enable the infection zone to be reduced within a few weeks, thus reducing the impact of the exceptional measures taken; whereas in the circumstances, this part of pig production in the Netherlands should be separated from normal trade in products intended for human consumption and processed into products intended for uses other than human consumption;
Whereas a buying-in price should be fixed at which the pigs are to be take over by the intervention agency; whereas that price should be based on the market price recorded in the Netherlands within the meaning of Council Regulation (EEC) No 43/81 of 1 January 1981 establishing a list of representative markets for pigmeat in the Community (5) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3799/85 (6), and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 56/81 of 1 January 1981 on the marketing stage to which the average price for pig carcases refers (7), the price being derived from those for grade II carcases within the meaning of the Community scale for grading pig carcases laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2760/75 (8);

Whereas the amounts to be used correspond to the basic and buying-in prices laid down by the Commission in its proposals to the Council for the fixation of the prices applicable in the 1987/88 marketing year; whereas, in the present situation on the market for the products in question, the maintenance of the prices applied in the preceding year, even for a limited period, would actually be an incentive to buying in and would lead to an irreversible situation in view of the possibility of a fall in the prices to be adopted for the new marketing year; whereas, however, the amounts set out hereinafter are only an interim protective measure without prejudice to the prices decisions to be adopted subsequently by the Council;
Whereas Spain during the first stage, and Portugal, during the first stage, are authorized to maintain, in the fruit and vegetables sector, the rules in force under the previous national arrangements for the organization of their domestic agricultural markets under the conditions laid down in Articles 133 to 135 and 262 to 265 respectively of the Act of Accession; whereas, therefore, the amounts fixed in this Regulation are applicable only in the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1503/87 of 27 May 1987 laying down interim protective measures in the fruit and vegetable sector as regards cauliflowers, tomatoes, peaches, apricots and lemons for June 1987', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe intervention operations provided for in Articles 15 and 19 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 shall be carried out at prices determined on the basis of the following amounts:\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3488/89 of 21 November 1989 laying down the method of decision for certain provisions laid down for agricultural products in the framework of Mediterranean agreements (1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with the agreements concluded with various Mediterranean third countries, the Community may decide that the entry prices for certain fruit and vegetables originating in such countries should vary, taking account of the annual  reviews of trade flows by product and country pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 451/89 of 20 February 1989 concerning the procedure to be applied to certain agricultural products originating in various Mediterranean third countries (2);
Whereas an examination of the outlook for export flows from Mediterranean third countries in the light of the overall trend on the Community market points to the need for the entry prices for oranges, clementines, mandarins and other similar citrus  hybrids, lemons and tomatoes to vary;
Whereas the variation in the entry price must, for each product concerned, relate to the amount to be deducted as customs duties from the representative prices recorded in the Community for the calculation of the entry price referred to in Article 24 of  Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1754/92 (4); whereas, depending on the product and origin, reductions, as appropriate, of  one-half or two-thirds during trading periods will enable the desired objective to be attained; whereas such reductions must apply within the quantitative limits determined, in accordance with the Mediterranean agreements;
Whereas this variation in the entry prices is to apply in respect of specific quantities which must be entered in the accounts during the periods laid down in the agreements; whereas such entry in the accounts must take place through the statistical  monitoring introduced for the administration of quotas;
Whereas provision should however be made for a Community surveillance system for tomatoes from Morocco imported into the Community in May given the lack of a quota for that period;

fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76 (2) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) As the standing invitations to tender for the export refunds on rice have ended for this year, refunds in ordinary law for this product need no longer be fixed. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.\n\n((3)) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(2)lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.\n\n((4)) As the standing invitations to tender for the export refunds on rice have ended for this year, refunds in ordinary law for this product need no longer be fixed. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.\n\n((5)) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.\n\n((6)) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.\n\n((7)) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.\n\n((8)) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((9)) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or

Whereas:
(1) Directive 2006/21/EC provides for waste characterisation as part of the waste management plan, which has to be drawn up by the operator of extractive industries and approved by the competent authority. Annex II of that Directive provides a list of certain aspects to be included in the waste characterisation.
(2) The purpose of the characterisation of extractive waste is to obtain the relevant information on the waste to be managed in order to be able to assess and monitor its properties, behaviour and characteristics and thereby ensure that it is managed under environmentally safe conditions in the long term. Furthermore, the characterisation of extractive waste should facilitate the determination of the options for managing such waste and the related mitigation measures in order to protect human health and the environment.
(3) The necessary information and data for the characterisation of extractive waste should be collected on the basis of existing relevant and appropriate information or, if needed, by sampling and testing. It should be ensured that information and data for waste characterisation are appropriate, of adequate quality and representative of the waste. This information should be duly justified in the waste management plan to the full satisfaction of the competent authority.
(4) The level of detail of information to be gathered and the related sampling or testing needs should be adapted to the type of waste, the potential environmental risks, and the intended waste facility. From a technical point of view, it should be made possible to adopt an iterative approach to ensure appropriate waste characterisation.
(5) From a technical point of view, it is appropriate to exempt waste defined as inert in accordance with the criteria laid down in Commission Decision 2009/359/EC (2) from part of the geochemical testing.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 7 November 1980 approving aids from the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal-mining industry during 1979 (Only the German text is authentic) (80/1279/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 528/76/ECSC of 25 February 1976 regarding the Community system of measures taken by the Member States to assist the coal-mining industry (1),
Having consulted the Council,
I
Whereas the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany has informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 2 of the Decision, of the financial measures which it intends to implement directly or indirectly for the benefit of the coal industry in 1979 ; whereas of these measures the following may be approved pursuant to that Decision: >PIC FILE= ""T0035425"">  >PIC FILE= ""T0035438"">
Whereas these aids meet the criteria laid down in the Decision for the admissibility of such State assistance;
Whereas the investment of DM 746 600 000 is proposed for investment projects for mines, coking plants, briquette works and pit-head power stations ; whereas the percentage of all investment covered by investment aid is more than 80 %;
Whereas in relation to the Community's new policy for coal, this 1979 investment aid, which increased slightly vis-Ă -vis 1978, is to be regarded as beneficial since it will promote the long-term stabilization of production  (1) OJ No L 63, 11.3.1976, p. 1.  in the German coalfields. The aid complies with the provisions of Article 7 (1) of the Decision;
Whereas, the purpose and amount of the aid in question shows that, pursuant to Article 7 (5) of the Decision, the Federal Government must notify the Commission at least once a year, in respect of each project in the programme which it has decided to carry out, of the aims pursued, the sums invested and the amounts of the aid;
Whereas the sum of DM 68 000 000 to promote innovation is intended to ensure that research results are applied to production as quickly as possible ; whereas the aid is lower than the costs borne by the undertakings and is granted in respect of individual projects which, when completed, are likely to prove their economic worth to coal-mining in the medium term ; whereas the purpose and amount of this aid show that it is compatible with the third subparagraph of Article 7 (3) of the Decision;
Whereas the aid of DM 110 000 000 towards the payment of the coal-winning premium helps the coal industry to secure a stable, skilled workforce, which is imperative if its productivity is to increase ; whereas the undertakings moreover incur expenditure on the necessary recruitment, training, retraining and retention of workers which is several times the amount of aid in the form of this premium;
Whereas the purpose and amount of the coal-mining premium show that this measure is compatible with Article 8 of the Decision;
Whereas the aid of DM 121 500 000 for the building-up of long-term security stocks is a measure by the Federal Government to increase the long-term security of energy supply ; whereas to this end, the emergency association of German mining industries has purchased 10 million tonnes of coal and coke ; whereas the aid proposed by the Federal Government for this purpose covers only part of the actual current cost of maintaining these stocks;
Whereas the purpose and amount of the aid show that this measure is compatible with Article 10 of the Decision;
II
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 (2) of the Decision, an examination of the compatibility of the abovementioned aids with the proper functioning of the common market must also extend to all other financial measures to support current production in 1979;
Whereas on this basis the total cost of the proposed measures amounts to 1 023 500 000 European units of account i.e. 10 798 European units of account per tonne produced ; whereas, compared with other Member States, current production in the Federal Republic of Germany is more heavily subsidized (per tonne) than in the United Kingdom and substantially less than in France and Belgium;
Whereas the following remarks can be made on the compatibility of these aids for current production with the proper functioning of the common market:    - owing to the large stocks of coal and coke on hand there were no supply difficulties in 1979,
- the level of exports of German coal to the other Member States fell in 1979 compared with 1978,
- price alignment agreements were hardly entered into in 1979,
- industrial consumers of coal did not receive indirect aid in 1979 as a result of the prices of German coking coal and steam coal,
- rationalization of production in 1979 was achieved by heavy investment and the closure of two unprofitable pits;
Whereas it may therefore be concluded that the German aids for current production in the coal industry in 1979 are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market;
Whereas this applies even when account is taken of aids to the coal mines under Decision 73/287/ECSC;
III
Whereas, pursuant to Article 14 (1) of the Decision, the Commission must ensure that the aids authorized are used for the purposes set out in Articles 7 to 12 thereof ; whereas the Commission must be informed, in particular, of the amount of the aids and of the manner in which they were apportioned,","{'title': '80/1279/ECSC: Commission Decision of 7 November 1980 approving aids from the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal-mining industry during 1979 (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorized in respect of the 1979 calendar year to grant the following aids to the coal industry:    1. grant of investment aid not exceeding DM 746 600 000 to undertakings in the coal industry in order to increase investment;\n\n2. promotion of development and innovation not exceeding DM 68 000 000;\n\n3. payment of premiums to shift-paid workers and piece workers for each shift worked underground, not exceeding DM 110 000 000;\n\n4. aid not exceeding DM 121 500 000 for the build-up of long-term security stocks.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany shall notify the Commission by 31 December 1980 of details of the aids granted pursuant to this Decision, and in particular of the amounts paid and the manner in which they are apportioned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 November 1980.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nGuido BRUNNER\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

of 22 December 2003
amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) Food additives may be approved for use in foodstuffs only if they comply with Annex II to Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption(3).
(2) Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners(4) lays down a list of food additives that may be used in the Community and the conditions for their use.
(3) There have been technical developments in the field of food additives since the adoption of Directive 95/2/EC. That Directive should be adapted to take account of those developments.
(4) Council Directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production(5) provides for the adoption of a list of additives necessary for the storage and use of flavourings, and the adoption of any special conditions for the use of such additives that may be necessary for the protection of public health and to ensure fair trade.
(5) It is desirable to incorporate into Directive 95/2/EC those measures on additives necessary for the storage and use of flavourings, in order to contribute to transparency and consistency of Community legislation, and to facilitate compliance with Community legislation on food additives by food manufacturers, especially by small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, according to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(6), flavourings fall within the definition of ""food"".
(6) While the use of additives which are necessary to ensure the safety and quality of flavourings and to facilitate their storage and use should be authorised, the levels of additives present in such flavourings should be the minimum required to achieve the intended purpose. In addition, consumers should be guaranteed correct, adequate and non-misleading information on the use of additives.
(7) The presence of an additive in a foodstuff, due to the use of a flavouring, is generally low and the additive does not have a technological function in the foodstuff. However, if under certain circumstances the additive does have a technological function in the compound foodstuff, it should be considered as an additive of the compound foodstuff and not as an additive of the flavouring, and the relevant rules relating to the additive in the particular foodstuff should apply, including the labelling rules laid down in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs(7).
(8) In accordance with Directive 88/388/EEC, food manufacturers should be informed about the concentrations of all additives in flavourings in order to enable them to comply with Community legislation. That Directive also requires quantitative labelling of each component subject to a quantitative limitation in a foodstuff. A quantitative limitation is expressed either numerically or by the ""quantum satis"" principle.
(9) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of ensuring market unity and a high level of consumer protection to lay down rules on the use of additives in flavourings. This Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(10) In accordance with a request from a Member State and the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food, established by Commission Decision 97/579/EC of 23 July 1997 setting up Scientific Committees in the field of consumer health and food safety(8), hydrogenated poly-1-decene, which was authorised at national level under Directive 89/107/EEC, should be authorised at Community level.
(11) Biphenyl (E 230), orthophenyl phenol (E 231) and sodium orthophenyl phenol (E 232) are listed as preservatives in and on citrus fruits in Directive 95/2/EC. However, they fall under the definition of ""plant protection products"" in Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(9). Therefore, they should no longer come within the scope of Directive 95/2/EC. The Member States and the Commission should take all possible steps to ensure that there is no legal vacuum with regard to these substances. Authorisation to place on the market these substances as plant protection products should be dealt with as swiftly as possible.
(12) On 4 April 2003, the Scientific Committee on Food stated that the temporary acceptable daily intake for E 214 to E 219 p-hydroxybenzoic acid alkyl esters and their sodium salts should be withdrawn if no further data are submitted in respect of intake and toxicity.
(13) Directive 95/2/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) Council Directive 67/427/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the use of certain preservatives for the surface treatment of citrus fruit and on the control measures to be used for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of preservatives in and on citrus fruit(10) lays down the control measures on preservatives in and on citrus fruits. Since those preservatives are no longer authorised for use in citrus fruits by Directive 95/2/EC, it is necessary to repeal Directive 67/427/EEC.
(15) The Scientific Committee on Food has been consulted on the adoption of provisions that may have an effect upon public health, pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 89/107/EEC,","{'title': 'Directive 2003/114/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 2003 amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDirective 95/2/EC is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1351/86 (2), and in particular Article 27 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas lemons are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas lemons harvested during a given crop year are marketed from June to May of the next year; whereas reference prices should therefore be fixed for the period 1 June to 31 May of the following year;
Whereas, to take seasonal variations into account, the year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State with regard to Article 23 plus transport costs in part for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;

(2) Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications. Therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications.
(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC. It is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures should be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 448/98, in its Annex I, amended Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 in order to introduce in the ESA 95 methodology the principle for allocating FISIM and set up experimental methods of allocating FISIM which were to be tested by Member States from 1995 to 2001, the trial period being sufficiently long to evaluate whether the allocation yielded more reliable results than the present zero allocation for the correct measurement of the economic activity concerned.
(3) In accordance with Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 448/98, a final report has been presented on 21 June 2002 by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, containing a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the implications of the experimental methods for allocating and calculating FISIM. This final report concluded that the results of the trial period were positive, as it is broadly recognised that the allocation of FISIM would lead to major improvements in the methodology of the ESA 95 and to a more accurate comparison of gross domestic product (GDP) levels within the European Union.
(4) Since the findings of the final evaluation report on the reliability of the results obtained during the trial period have been positive, the method to be used for the allocation of FISIM must be adopted before 31 December 2002 in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 448/98.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 13,571 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4159/2 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 16 September 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Bourgogne; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;

Whereas:
(1) The additive lasalocid A sodium (Avatec 15 %) was authorised under certain conditions in accordance with Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2). This additive is currently authorised in the group ‘coccidiostats’ for turkeys by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 (3) and chickens reared for laying and chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1455/2004 (4). This additive has been notified as existing product on the basis of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and is subject to the verifications and the procedures in application of that provision.
(2) The company concerned submitted a new supplementary dossier requesting a modification of existing carrier.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility to modify the authorisation of an additive further to an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) on whether the authorisation still meets the conditions set out in that Regulation.
(4) The Commission asked the Authority to evaluate the relevant data supporting the application for the change of authorisation referred to in Regulations (EC) Nos 2430/1999 and 1455/2004 and to advise on the possible harmful effects on safety and efficacy when lasalocid A sodium is used by new carrier. Following this request, the Authority has published on 26 August 2005 an opinion on the use of lasalocid A sodium in feedingstuffs.
(5) The opinion of the Authority concludes that the use of the new formulation would not be expected to introduce any additional risks or concerns for human, animal and environmental safety and that the new formulation does not adversely influence the stability of lasalocid A sodium.
(6) A Maximum Residue Level (MRL) for substance concerned has been established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 (5) laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue levels of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin.
(7) Regulations (EC) Nos 2430/1999 and 1455/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In June 2000, the Commission received a complaint concerning the alleged injurious dumping by imports of colour television receivers (CTVs) originating in or exported from Turkey.
(2) The complaint was lodged by the Producers of European Televisions in Cooperation (Poetic) acting on behalf of Community producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of CTVs pursuant to Article 4(1) and Article 5(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (the basic Regulation).
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) The Commission, after consultation, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), accordingly initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of CTVs, currently classifiable within CN codes ex 8528 12 52, 8528 12 54, 8528 12 56, 8528 12 58, ex 8528 12 62 and 8528 12 66 and originating in or exported from Turkey.
(5) It should be noted that in April 2000, two review investigations under Article 11(2) and (3) of the basic Regulation had been initiated regarding the anti- dumping measures applicable to imports of CTVs originating in the People's Republic of China, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand(4).
(6) The Commission officially advised the exporting producers, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, the representative consumer organisations and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
(7) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of its investigation. Verification visits were carried out at the premises of the following companies:
(a) Community producers

B. FINDINGS ON ORIGIN
(8) CTVs frequently incorporate components and parts originating in countries other than the country of manufacture or assembly of the finished product, with the result that CTVs may be considered as originating in a country other than the country of manufacture or assembly. Thus, in accordance with the Community's consistent practice and pursuant to Article 1(3) of the basic Regulation, the examination of the origin of the CTVs exported from Turkey formed part of the anti-dumping investigation.
(9) Origin was examined in the light of Article 22 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92(5) of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, which establishes that the non-preferential rules of origin apply to all non-preferential commercial policy instruments, such as anti-dumping.
(10) In accordance with Article 39 and Annex 11 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(6) laying down provisions for the implementation of the Community Customs code, specific non-preferential rules of origin apply for CTVs. According to these rules, a CTV is considered to originate in the country where the added value of the assembly operations, and, if applicable, the incorporation of parts originating in the country of assembly represents at least 45 % of the ex-works price of the CTV. When the 45 % rule is not met, the CTV originates in the country of origin of parts whose ex-works price represents more than 35 % of the ex-works price of the CTV.
(11) When applying the specific non-preferential origin rules in the present investigation, it was established that the origin of all CTVs exported to the Community between 1 July 1999 and 30 June 2000 (investigation period or IP) was other than Turkish. Exports to the Community were instead found to have their origin in the exporting countries subjected to the review investigations mentioned in recital 5, the Community or other third countries not subject to any investigation. In particular, it was found that for the exports of the investigated companies which correspond to all exports of CTVs from Turkey to the Community during the IP, the 45 % added value rule was not met. Thus, the origin had to be determined on the basis of the 35 % value rule of the non-originating parts/materials.
(12) On the basis of the 35 % value rule of the non-originating parts/materials it was established that the origin of the cathode-ray colour television picture tube (CPT) virtually determined the origin of the CTVs, since the ex-works price of the CPT represented, in all cases, at least 35 % of the ex-works price of the CTV. It should be noted that there is no production of CPTs in Turkey and, therefore, all CPTs are imported. Accordingly, the origin examination concluded that the CTVs exported from Turkey during the IP were of the origins of the CPTs used in their assembly.
C. TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(13) In view of the above findings on origin, the Commission concludes that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of CTVs originating in Turkey should be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping measures.
(14) All interested parties received disclosure of the findings on origin and were given an opportunity to comment and to be heard. One interested party contested the applicability of the non-preferential rules of origin in the case of Turkey, given the EC-Turkey Customs Union. However, neither Decision No 1/95 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 22 December 1995 on implementing the final phase of the Customs Union(7), nor the Community Customs Code provides for a derogation from the applicability of the non-preferential rules of origin in the case of imports from countries which are in a customs union with the Community.
(15) Finally, the Community industry argued that the origin criteria was irrelevant since the basic Regulation allowed the imposition of anti-dumping measures on the basis of the country of provenance. It should be noted that it is the consistent practice of the Community to impose anti-dumping measures solely on products originating in a third country. This was also the case in previous investigation on imports of the same product(8),",{'title': '2001/725/EC: Commission Decision of 28 September 2001 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of colour television receivers originating in Turkey (notified under document number C(2001) 2916)'}

Having regard to Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 97/78/EC of 18 December 1997 laying down the principles governing the organisation of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (2), and in particular Article 18 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU (3) lays down rules on veterinary checks to be carried out on live animals and products of animal origin entering certain French overseas departments from third countries, including a list of authorised entry points (‘the list of authorised entry points’).
(2) France has submitted a plan to the Commission for an authorised entry point located in the French overseas department of Mayotte. That plan details the facilities, the necessary equipment and the trained staff to carry out the veterinary checks to verify that Union public and animal health requirements for products of animal origin are met.
(3) In addition, that plan demonstrates that all consignments of products of animal origin are required to be presented for import at the authorised entry point and that their dispatch into other parts of Union territory is effectively prevented. It also shows that the specific requirements laid down in Articles 3, 4 and 5 of Implementing Decision 2012/44/EU are met.

Whereas:
(1) The use of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009 of 13 November 2009 concerning the authorisation of an enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) as a feed additive for chickens for fattening (holder of authorisation Aveve NV) (2).
(2) The holder of the authorisation submitted an application for changing the terms of the authorisation of this feed additive when used in chickens for fattening by reducing the minimum recommended dose of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MUCL 49754) from 4 000 XU (3)/kg and 900 BGU (4)/kg to 2 000 XU/kg and 450 BGU/kg. That application was accompanied by the relevant data supporting the request for the change.
(3) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 10 November 2010 that the data provided from three trials in chickens for fattening do not support the reduction of the minimum recommended dose from 4 000 XU and 900 BGU/kg feed to 2 000 XU and 450 BGU/kg feed because analyses of the feeds showed that the intended doses were considerably exceeded. However, the data showed that the product is efficacious at a lower dose than the one currently authorised. According to the Authority the data indicates, as an approximation, that 3 000 XU and 600 BGU/kg feed has the potential to improve growth rate and feed to gain ratio in chickens for fattening (5).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/118/EEC of 17 December 1992 laying down animal health and public health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of products not subject to the said requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 89/662/EEC and, as regards pathogens, to Directive 90/425/EEC(1), as last amended by Directive 2002/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 15 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Specific public health conditions for the preparation of collagen intended for human consumption should be laid down. Provided that these conditions are the same for collagen intended for human consumption and collagen not intended for human consumption, and provided that hygiene conditions are also the same, it should be possible to produce and/or store both types of collagen in the same establishment.
(2) The authorisation and registration, inspection and hygiene conditions for the establishments preparing collagen should be set. Certain health conditions contained in Council Directive 77/99/EEC of 21 December 1976 on health problems affecting the production and marketing of meat products and certain other products of animal origin(3), as last amended by Directive 97/76/EC(4), and in Council Directive 93/43/EEC of 14 June 1993 on the hygiene of foodstuffs(5), are relevant for the preparation of collagen.
(3) Article 2.3.13.7 of the International Animal Health Code (2001) issued by the International Office of Epizootics on BSE recommends that if gelatine and collagen are prepared exclusively from hides and skins, veterinary administrations should authorise their import and transit through their territories without restriction, regardless of the status of the exporting countries.
(4) Under Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(6), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1494/2002(7), hides and skins within the meaning of Directive 92/118/EEC, derived from healthy ruminants and collagen derived from such hides and skins are not subject to restrictions on placing on the market.
(5) The Scientific Steering Committee adopted an opinion on the safety of collagen on 10 and 11 May 2001, addressing the question of the safety in relation to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (hereinafter TSE) of collagen produced from ruminant hides.
(6) The raw material used for the production of collagen consists mainly of bovine connective tissue of hides and tendons, calf skins, sheep skins and pig skins. To ensure the safety of the raw material, it must derive from animals that pass ante and post-mortem inspections as fit for human consumption. Such material must also be collected, transported, stored and handled in the most hygienic ways possible.
(7) To guarantee traceability of the raw material, collection centres and tanneries, which intend to supply the raw material, should be authorised and registered. A model commercial document should also be prescribed to accompany the raw material during transportation and at time of delivery to the collection centres, tanneries and collagen processing plants.
(8) It is appropriate to amend the current commercial document for raw material destined for the production of gelatine for human consumption, to take into account particulars in relation to control procedures in certain Member States.
(9) The standards for the finished product should be fixed to ensure that it is not contaminated with substances or micro-organisms presenting a risk to consumer health. Pending a scientific evaluation of such standards, it is appropriate to include, on a provisional basis, generally accepted standards as regards contamination. The requirements for packaging, storage and transport of the finished product should also be laid down.
(10) It is necessary to lay down specific health rules for the importation of collagen and raw material destined for the production of collagen intended for human consumption. Specimens of health certificates to accompany the imported collagen and raw material destined for the production of collagen for human consumption should be drawn up. It is also necessary for the Commission to recognise conditions offering equivalent guarantees based on a proposal submitted by a third country.

Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

(6) The rural development measures to be financed by the EAGGF are governed, in particular as regards their compatibility and consistency with common agricultural policy measures, by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(2).
(7) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(8) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(9) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing Financial Instruments.
(10) The EIB has been involved in drawing up the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and has declared itself prepared to contribute to its implementation with the estimated loan amounts indicated in this Decision and in conformity with its statutory provisions.
(11) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1) and in particular Article 102a(3), in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 102a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 72/2009 (2) provides for an annual payment to recognised German producer organisations in the hops sector. The amounts received by producer organisations should be used to finance measures adopted in order to achieve the aims referred to in Article 122(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(2) So as to ensure the orderly management of the payments, Germany should adopt rules on the submission of applications by producer organisations, including deadlines, and ensure that all applications contain the information that is needed in order to allow the German competent authority to verify whether producer organisations are entitled to payments.
(3) In order to ensure that payments are made in a fair manner, the amounts to be paid to producer organisations should be calculated on a pro rata basis, linked to the eligible hops areas of their members.
(4) In order to ensure the efficient use of financial resources, payments made by the competent German payment agency should be committed within a reasonable period of time.
(5) In order to protect the financial interests of the European Union, no payments should be made before checks in respect of the eligibility criteria have been made. These control measures should involve administrative checking supplemented by on-the-spot controls. Amounts unduly paid should be recovered and sanctions should be determined in order to deter applicants from fraudulent behaviour and serious negligence.
(6) Article 63(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (3) which has established common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy as well as certain support schemes for farmers has integrated the partially coupled payments in the hops sector into the single payments scheme from 1 January 2010. In order to ensure the continuity of payments, the first payment of the Union aid pursuant to Article 102a of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 and this Regulation should be made by 30 April 2011 at the latest.
(7) In order to facilitate the execution of the first payment, it is appropriate to allow the German competent authority to proceed, in the year preceding that payment, with the identification of the potential beneficiaries and the potentially eligible hop areas.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '17.8.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 216/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 738/2010\nof 16 August 2010\nlaying down detailed rules on payments to German producer organisations in the hops sector', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 102a(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 72/2009(2)provides for an annual payment to recognised German producer organisations in the hops sector.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97(3) provides for the Community to contribute towards costs incurred by Member States in implementing new action programmes, arising out of new Community obligations, approved by the Commission and aimed at improving the structures or effectiveness of EAGGF Guarantee Section expenditure controls. Article 4 of the said Regulation provides that the Community financial contribution is to be granted per calendar year for a period of five consecutive years starting from 1997, within the limit of the annual appropriations authorised by the budget authority in the light of the financial perspective.
(2) The Commission has transmitted to the Council a report on the results of the application of Regulation (EC) No 723/97 during the period 1997 to 2000. Given the assessment reports prepared by the Member States and the effectiveness of the programmes implemented, the Commission considers that Member States should continue to receive financial assistance for the implementation of the programmes provided for in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.
(3) In particular, since new expensive techniques have been introduced by Council Regulation (EC) No 1593/2000 of 17 July 2000 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes(4), in the area of the improvement of the agricultural parcel identification system having recourse to the technique of geographical information system and of digital orthophotography, a Community contribution is justified to cover part of the expenditure incurred by Member States in the framework of new action programmes covering this domain. In this context, it is appropriate, for reasons of legal clarity, to delete the last indent of Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 723/97.

(2005/624/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/60/EC of 27 June 2002 laying down specific provisions for the control of African swine fever and amending Directive 92/119/EEC as regards Teschen disease and African swine fever (1), and in particular Article 11(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2005/363/EC of 2 May 2005 concerning animal health protection measures against African swine fever in Sardinia, Italy (2) was adopted in response to the presence of African swine fever in Sardinia, Italy.
(2) Outbreaks of African swine fever still occur in Sardinia and Italy takes measures to combat African swine fever in Sardinia within the framework of Directive 2002/60/EC.
(3) Directive 2002/60/EC provides that the competent authority establishes, immediately after the diagnosis of African swine fever in pigs on a holding has been officially confirmed, a protection zone with a radius of at least three kilometres around the outbreak site, which shall itself be included in a surveillance zone of a radius of at least ten kilometres.
(4) Directive 2002/60/EC also provides that pigs may not be removed from the holding in which they are kept (holding of origin) in a protection and surveillance zone during a period of respectively 40 and 30 days after the completion of the preliminary cleansing, disinfection and, if necessary, disinsectisation of the infected holdings. After these periods, the competent authorities may authorise the removal of pigs from the holding of origin to a slaughterhouse if specific conditions are met. In particular, fresh meat from these pigs is either to be processed or marked with a special mark and processed at later stage.
(5) Directive 2002/60/EC allows for a derogation from the said conditions to be granted to Member States at their request and if appropriate justification is submitted.
(6) An outbreak of African swine fever was confirmed in the municipality of Anela in Sardinia on 25 May 2005. The competent authority established immediately a protection zone with a radius of three kilometres around the outbreak site, which is included in a surveillance zone of a radius of ten kilometres around this site. Another outbreak was confirmed in the established protection zone on 10 June 2005 in the municipality of Bultei.
(7) The Italian authorities have asked the Commission for derogation from the fresh meat to be marked with the foreseen special mark and the condition that fresh meat originating from holdings situated within the established surveillance zone has to be processed. The request was justified by demonstrating the serious difficulties to find a market for processed meat, the consequences for the welfare of the pigs in some holdings if they are not slaughtered in due time and the negligible additional animal health risk related to such derogation if also specific disease control measures are adopted. It is therefore appropriate to provide that, under certain conditions, pigmeat from holdings situated in the established surveillance zone does not have to be processed and marked with the foreseen special mark and processed at later stage. In order to guarantee the absence of African swine fever and any risk for spread of the disease, additional measures as regards the holding of origin and the movement of these pigs have to be laid down.
(8) The checking and sampling procedures as regards the removal of pigs from a holding in an established surveillance zone to a slaughterhouse in accordance with the diagnostic manual (3) have to be fully applied. In case the derogation provided for in Article 11(4) of Directive 2002/60/EC is used paragraph 6 of Chapter IV of the Annex of the diagnostic manual applies.
(9) It is also appropriate to provide that pigmeat, pigmeat products and any other products containing pigmeat of pigs originating from holdings for which such a derogation is granted, is marked with the special mark foreseen by Decision 2005/363/EC in order to ensure that such pigmeat, pigmeat products and other products containing pigmeat are not dispatched from Sardinia and to ensure the traceability of such pigmeat and products.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on food additives (1), and in particular Article 10(3), Article 14 and Article 30(5) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings (2), and in particular Article 7(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 lays down a Union list of food additives approved for use in foods and their conditions of use.
(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 (3) lays down specifications for food additives listed in Annexes II and III to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008.
(3) The Union list and the specifications may be updated in accordance with the common procedure referred to in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008 either on the initiative of the Commission or following an application.
(4) On 5 May 2006, an application was submitted for authorisation of the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a preservative in several food categories. The application was made available to the Member States pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008.
(5) Subsequently, in April of 2007 the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) evaluated the safety of the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a food preservative and allocated an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0,5 mg/kg body weight (4). Conservative estimates of exposure to the substance, both in adults and in children, suggested that it was likely that the ADI would be exceeded at the maximum proposed use levels for several food categories.
(6) Following these conclusions, the applicant revised its uses and use levels and requested an authorisation of the use in heat-treated meat products. In July 2013 the Authority published a statement on a refined exposure assessment of Ethyl lauroyl arginate based on its revised proposed uses as a food additive (5), and concluded that the exposure for all population groups is below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0,5 mg/kg bw/day.
(7) There is a technological need to use Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a preservative in heat-treated meat products in order to improve the microbiological quality of those food products, including inhibiting the growth of harmful micro-organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes. As the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate in heat treated meat products will help maintaining their quality and safety, it is appropriate to authorise its use in heat-treated meat products and to assign number E 243 to that food additive.
(8) The specifications for Ethyl lauroyl arginate (E 243) should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union list of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.
(9) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.

In July 2013 the Authority published a statement on a refined exposure assessment of Ethyl lauroyl arginate based on its revised proposed uses as a food additive(5), and concluded that the exposure for all population groups is below the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0,5\xa0mg/kg bw/day.\n\n((7)) There is a technological need to use Ethyl lauroyl arginate as a preservative in heat-treated meat products in order to improve the microbiological quality of those food products, including inhibiting the growth of harmful micro-organisms such asListeria monocytogenes. As the use of Ethyl lauroyl arginate in heat treated meat products will help maintaining their quality and safety, it is appropriate to authorise its use in heat-treated meat products and to assign number E 243 to that food additive.\n\n((8)) The specifications for Ethyl lauroyl arginate (E 243) should be included in Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 when it is included in the Union list of food additives laid down in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 for the first time.\n\n((9)) Regulations (EC) No 1333/2008 and (EU) No 231/2012 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((10)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008 is amended in accordance with Annex I to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe Annex to Regulation (EU) No 231/2012 is amended in accordance with Annex II to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the procedure provided for in the second paragraph of Article 19 of Directive 2000/13/EC, the Italian authorities notified the Commission on 25 August 2009 of the draft Decree setting out standards governing the labelling of shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk, as well as milk products.
(2) According to Article 1 of the notified Decree, this applies to shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk as well as milk products.
(3) Article 2 of the notified Decree requires that the labels of sterilised shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk must indicate the place of origin of the milk which has undergone the treatments in question.
(4) Article 3(1) of the notified Decree provides that the labels of milk products must indicate the place of origin of the milk used in the preparation of such products.
(5) Article 3(3) of the notified Decree provides that the labels of cheeses, including cottage cheeses, containing substances obtained from processing milk or milk products must include those substances in the list of ingredients with a reference to the place of origin of the milk used for processing those substances.
(6) Article 4 of the notified Decree provides that the labels of cheeses obtained from curd must indicate the place of origin of the milk used in the curd.
(7) Directive 2000/13/EC harmonises the rules governing the labelling of foodstuffs by making provision for, on the one hand, harmonisation of certain national provisions and, secondly, arrangements for non-harmonised national provisions. The scope of harmonisation is defined in Article 3(1) of that Directive, which lists all the particulars that are compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs in accordance with Articles 4 to 17 and subject to the exceptions contained therein.
(8) In particular, in accordance with Article 3(1)(8) of Directive 2000/13/EC the indication of the place of origin or provenance is mandatory where failure to give such a particular might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff. This provision puts in place an appropriate mechanism to counter the risk of consumers being misled in cases where some elements could imply that a given food comes from an origin or provenance different from the true one.
(9) Furthermore, Article 4(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC provides that other particulars in addition to those listed in Article 3(1) of that Directive may be required, in the case of specified foodstuffs, by Union provisions or, in their absence, by national provisions.
(10) Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC allows the adoption of non-harmonised national provisions if they are justified on one of the grounds listed therein, including, inter alia, the prevention of fraud and the protection of public health, and provided they are not of such a nature as to impede application of the definitions and rules laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC. Therefore, where draft national labelling provisions have been proposed in a Member State, it is necessary to examine their compatibility with the above-mentioned requirements and the provisions of the Treaty.
(11) The Italian authorities maintain that the notified Decree is necessary to define and regulate the traceability system for sterilised shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk and milk products. They also state that the notified Decree is necessary to regulate the labelling of the foods listed in Article 1 thereof in order to ensure that the interests of the consumer are protected to the greatest extent.
(12) With regard to the traceability of the products listed in Article 1 of the notified Decree, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (2) requests that, at all stages of production, processing and distribution, a comprehensive system of traceability should be established by food businesses so that targeted and accurate withdrawals can be undertaken or information given to consumers or control officials. In particular, pursuant to Article 18 thereof, food business operators shall be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food, and the other businesses to which their products have been supplied. Moreover, Article 19 of that Regulation foresees specific obligations for food business operators. The mandatory indication of origin on the label of the finished products in question is not necessary information for the purpose of meeting those traceability requirements.
(13) In addition, apart from a generic reference to the need of protecting the interests of the consumer, the Italian authorities did not provide any justification allowing to conclude that, as regards the products listed in Article 1 of the notified Decree, the mandatory indication of the origin, beyond the obligation laid down in Article 3(1)(8) of Directive 2000/13/EC, is necessary.
(14) Therefore, the Italian authorities failed to demonstrate that the indication of origin as provided by the notified Decree is necessary to attain one of the objectives listed in Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC.
(15) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion on the above-mentioned provisions of the notified Decree, pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 19 of Directive 2000/13/EC.
(16) The Italian authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the provisions of notified Decree in question.
(17) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '23.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 102/52', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 April 2010\nconcerning the draft Decree from Italy setting out standards governing the labelling of shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk, as well as milk products\n(notified under document C(2010) 2436)\n(Only the Italian text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/229/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with the procedure provided for in the second paragraph of Article 19 of Directive 2000/13/EC, the Italian authorities notified the Commission on 25 August 2009 of the draft Decree setting out standards governing the labelling of shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk, as well as milk products.\n\n((2)) According to Article 1 of the notified Decree, this applies to shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk as well as milk products.\n\n((3)) Article 2 of the notified Decree requires that the labels of sterilised shelf-stable milk, UHT milk, micro-filtered pasteurised milk and high-temperature pasteurised milk must indicate the place of origin of the milk which has undergone the treatments in question.\n\n((4)) Article 3(1) of the notified Decree provides that the labels of milk products must indicate the place of origin of the milk used in the preparation of such products.\n\n((5)) Article 3(3) of the notified Decree provides that the labels of cheeses, including cottage cheeses, containing substances obtained from processing milk or milk products must include those substances in the list of ingredients with a reference to the place of origin of the milk used for processing those substances.\n\n((6)) Article 4 of the notified Decree provides that the labels of cheeses obtained from curd must indicate the place of origin of the milk used in the curd.\n\n((7)) Directive 2000/13/EC harmonises the rules governing the labelling of foodstuffs by making provision for, on the one hand, harmonisation of certain national provisions and, secondly, arrangements for non-harmonised national provisions.

(2007/513/Euratom)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular the second paragraph of Article 101 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Article 2(e) of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom Treaty) states that the European Atomic Energy Community (the Community) shall make certain, by appropriate supervision, that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they are intended.
(2) The Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM) was adopted in 1979 and entered into force in 1987. As of 27 June 2006, 118 States and the Community were parties to the CPPNM. All the Member States are Parties to the CPPNM.
(3) An Amendment Conference in accordance with Article 20 of the CPPNM was convened on 4 July 2005 under the auspices of the IAEA. The final act regarding the amendments to the CPPNM was signed by the Commission on behalf of the Community on 8 July 2005.
(4) The Court of Justice of the European Communities (Court of Justice) (1) decided that the participation of the Member States in the CPPNM is compatible with the provisions of the Euratom Treaty only subject to the conditions that, in so far as its own powers and jurisdiction are concerned, the Community as such is a party to the CPPNM on the same lines as the Member States and that certain commitments of the CPPNM can only be implemented, where the Community is concerned, by means of close association between the Community and the Member States, both in the negotiation and conclusion process and in fulfilment of the commitments assumed.
(5) The Court of Justice confirmed further that Article 2(e) of the Euratom Treaty gives the Community the task of making certain, by appropriate supervision, that nuclear materials are not diverted to purposes other than those for which they are intended, without making any distinction with regard to the nature of such diversions and the circumstances in which they might take place and finally that the very expression ‘safeguards’ which the Treaty uses to characterize the provisions of chapter VII has a wider scope than the mere substitution of a different destination for the one declared by a user of nuclear materials. Consequently, according to the Court of Justice, it includes also measures of physical protection (2). The Court of Justice also stated in its Ruling 1/78 that provisions related to criminal prosecution and extradition relate to matters falling within the jurisdiction of the Member States (3).
(6) According to Article 18(4) of the CPPNM, when becoming party to the Convention the Community must communicate to the depositary a declaration indicating which articles of the CPPNM do not apply to it. That declaration is attached to this Decision.
(7) Article 7 of the CPPNM requires each party to make certain offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature. It is understood that this provision leaves to the parties the choice of the nature, type and level of the penalties to be adopted. In particular, it does not require that the parties make the conducts described therein punishable by criminal penalties. Consequently, Article 7 applies to the Community, at least to some extent.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 115 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision 80/47/EEC of 20 December 1979 on surveillance and protective measures which Member States may be authorized to take in respect of imports of certain products originating in third countries and put into free circulation in another Member State (1), and in particular Articles 1 and 2 thereof,
Whereas Decision 80/47/EEC requires Member States to have prior authorization from the Commission before introducing intra-Community surveillance of the imports concerned;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3589/82 of 23 December 1982 on common rules for imports of certain textile products originating in third countries (2), by Regulation (EEC) No 3638/83 (3), the Commission has made imports into France, Italy and the United Kingdom of certain textile products of category 3, originating in Indonesia, subject to quantitative limits for the period 1984 to 1986; whereas imports of those products remain liberalized in the other Member States;
Whereas, by virtue of the trade measures thus introduced, there are disparities between the various Member States in the conditions for importing the products in question; whereas these disparities are likely to lead to deflection of trade;
Whereas, with a view to the rapid detection of deflection of trade likely to lead to, or aggravate, any economic difficulties in the sector concerned, the French Government asked the Commission, under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC, for authorization to apply prior intra-Community surveillance to imports of woven fabrics of synthetic textile fibres originating in Indonesia and put into free circulation in the other Member States;
Whereas the Commission examined, in particular, whether the imports could be made subject to intra-Community surveillance measures under Article 2 of Decision 80/47/EEC and whether information was given as regards the economic difficulties alleged;
Whereas surveillance measures may be authorized to textile products of group 1, as defined by Regulations (EEC) No 3589/82 and (EEC) No 3762/83 (4), even in the absence of deflection of trade, or requests for intra-Community licence, in view of the inherent risk of economic difficulties in trade in these products on the grounds of their extreme sensitivity to imports;
Whereas France should therefore be authorized to make imports of the woven fabrics of synthetic textile fibres in question of category 3, originating in Indonesia, subject to intra-Community surveillance until 30 June 1985,","{'title': '84/93/EEC: Commission Decision of 6 February 1984 authorizing the French Republic to apply intra-Community surveillance to imports of certain woven fabrics of synthetic textile fibres, originating in Indonesia, which have been put into free circulation in the Community (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe French Republic is authorized to apply intra-Community surveillance to the products set out in the Annex hereto, in accordance with Decision 80/47/EEC, until 30 June 1985.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 6 February 1984.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilhelm HAFERKAMP\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 16, 22. 1. 1980, p. 14.\n\n(2) OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1982, p. 106.\n\n(3) OJ No L 360, 23. 12. 1983, p. 29.\n\n(4) OJ No L 380, 31. 12. 1983, p. 1.\n\nANNEX\n\nTextile products for which categories have been established (1)\n\n1.2 //   //   // Category  // Country of origin  //   //  // 3  // Indonesia  //   //\n\n(1) See definition in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3589/82 (OJ No L 374, 31. 12. 1982, p. 106).'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of airspace in the single European sky (the airspace Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the single European sky (the framework Regulation) (2), and in particular Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Chapter 2, paragraph 6 of Annex 11 (3) to the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation requires the classification of airspace into air traffic services airspaces of defined dimensions, alphabetically designated from Class A to Class G, within which specific types of flights may operate and for which air traffic services and rules of operation are specified.
(2) The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has been mandated, in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, to examine a harmonised airspace classification scheme for the Single European Sky. The resulting mandate reports of 30 December 2004 and 30 April 2005 proposed the introduction of Class C Airspace as the appropriate classification for airspace above flight level 195. This Regulation takes full account of those reports. With a view to being consistent in the application by the Member States of such a classification, it is necessary to establish a harmonised airspace classification and provide for the access of flights operated under visual flight rules to it.
(3) Whilst no upper limit of the airspace is specified in this Regulation, airspace classification above flight level 195 should be consistent for all flights carried out in such airspace.
(4) Chapter 4, paragraph 5 of Annex 2 (4) to the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation introduces restrictions related to Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum Areas for flights operated under visual flight rules (VFR flights) above flight level 290, while paragraph 4 of that Chapter provides that VFR flights above flight level 200 require authorisation.
(5) The procedures for authorising access of VFR flights to airspace above flight level 195, up to and including flight level 285, need to be open and transparent across all Member States without restricting legitimate access of VFR flights or the flexibility of air traffic services.
(6) Member States should ensure a safe transition towards the classification of airspace above flight level 195 as Class C Airspace. As Member States require time to change their airspace classification, the application of this Regulation should be deferred until 1 July 2007.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Single Sky Committee,","{'header': '16.5.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 128/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 730/2006\nof 11 May 2006\non airspace classification and access of flights operated under visual flight rules above flight level 195\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Chapter 2, paragraph 6 of Annex 11(3)to the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation requires the classification of airspace into air traffic services airspaces of defined dimensions, alphabetically designated from Class A to Class G, within which specific types of flights may operate and for which air traffic services and rules of operation are specified.\n\n((2)) The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has been mandated, in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, to examine a harmonised airspace classification scheme for the Single European Sky.

of 16 September 2009
amending Council Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC, and Directive 2005/56/EC as regards reporting and documentation requirements in the case of mergers and divisions
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 44(2)(g) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (2),
Whereas:
(1) The European Council agreed, at its meeting on 8 and 9 March 2007, that administrative burdens on companies should be reduced by 25 % by the year 2012 in order to enhance the competitiveness of companies in the Community.
(2) Company law has been identified as one area imposing on companies numerous information obligations, some of which seem outdated or excessive. It is therefore appropriate to review those obligations and, where appropriate, to reduce the administrative burdens weighing on companies within the Community to the minimum needed in order to protect the interests of other stakeholders.
(3) The scope of Second Council Directive 77/91/EEC of 13 December 1976 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent (3), and of Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited liability companies (4), should be adapted in order to reflect changes in Finnish company law.
(4) Company websites or other websites offer, in certain cases, an alternative to publication via the companies registers. Member States should be able to designate those other websites which companies may use free of charge for such publication, such as websites of business associations or chambers of commerce or the central electronic platform referred to in First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community (5). Where the possibility exists of using company or other websites for publication of draft terms of merger and/or division and of other documents that have to be made available to shareholders and creditors in the process, guarantees relating to the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents should be met.
(5) The requirements concerning disclosure of draft terms of merger in cross-border mergers pursuant to Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies (6) should be similar to those applicable to domestic mergers and divisions pursuant to Directive 78/855/EEC and Sixth Council Directive 82/891/EEC of 17 December 1982 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty, concerning the division of public limited liability companies (7).
(6) Member States should be able to provide that the extensive reporting or information requirements relating to the merger or division of companies, laid down in Article 9 and Article 11(1)(c) of Directive 78/855/EEC and in Article 7 and Article 9(1)(c) of Directive 82/891/EEC, need not be complied with if all the shareholders of the companies involved in the merger or division agree that such compliance may be dispensed with.
(7) Any modification of Directives 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC allowing such agreement by shareholders should be without prejudice to the systems of protection of the interests of creditors of the companies involved and to rules aimed at ensuring the provision of necessary information to the employees of those companies and to public authorities, such as tax authorities, controlling the merger or division in accordance with existing Community law.
(8) It is not necessary to impose the requirement to draw up an accounting statement where an issuer whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market publishes half-yearly financial reports in accordance with Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market (8).
(9) An independent expert’s report as provided for under Directive 77/91/EEC is often not needed where an independent expert’s report protecting the interests of shareholders or creditors also has to be drawn up in the context of the merger or the division. Member States should therefore have the possibility in such cases of dispensing companies from the reporting requirement under Directive 77/91/EEC or of providing that both reports may be drawn up by the same expert.
(10) Mergers between parent companies and their subsidiaries have a reduced economic impact on shareholders and creditors where the parent company’s holding in the subsidiary amounts to 90 % or more of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote. The same applies to certain divisions, in particular when companies are split into new companies that are owned by the shareholders in the proportion to their rights in the company being divided. In those cases, the reporting requirements laid down by Directives 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC should therefore be reduced.
(11) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to reduce administrative burdens relating in particular to publication and documentation obligations of public limited liability companies within the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(12) Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC, 82/891/EEC and 2005/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

It is therefore appropriate to review those obligations and, where appropriate, to reduce the administrative burdens weighing on companies within the Community to the minimum needed in order to protect the interests of other stakeholders.\n\n((3)) The scope of Second Council Directive 77/91/EEC of 13 December 1976 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent(3), and of Third Council Directive 78/855/EEC of 9 October 1978 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty concerning mergers of public limited liability companies(4), should be adapted in order to reflect changes in Finnish company law.\n\n((4)) Company websites or other websites offer, in certain cases, an alternative to publication via the companies registers. Member States should be able to designate those other websites which companies may use free of charge for such publication, such as websites of business associations or chambers of commerce or the central electronic platform referred to in First Council Directive 68/151/EEC of 9 March 1968 on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 58 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent throughout the Community(5). Where the possibility exists of using company or other websites for publication of draft terms of merger and/or division and of other documents that have to be made available to shareholders and creditors in the process, guarantees relating to the security of the website and the authenticity of the documents should be met.\n\n((5)) The requirements concerning disclosure of draft terms of merger in cross-border mergers pursuant to Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies(6)should be similar to those applicable to domestic mergers and divisions pursuant to Directive 78/855/EEC and Sixth Council Directive 82/891/EEC of 17 December 1982 based on Article 54(3)(g) of the Treaty, concerning the division of public limited liability companies(7).\n\n((6)) Member States should be able to provide that the extensive reporting or information requirements relating to the merger or division of companies, laid down in Article 9 and Article 11(1)(c) of Directive 78/855/EEC and in Article 7 and Article 9(1)(c) of Directive 82/891/EEC, need not be complied with if all the shareholders of the companies involved in the merger or division agree that such compliance may be dispensed with.\n\n((7)) Any modification of Directives 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC allowing such agreement by shareholders should be without prejudice to the systems of protection of the interests of creditors of the companies involved and to rules aimed at ensuring the provision of necessary information to the employees of those companies and to public authorities, such as tax authorities, controlling the merger or division in accordance with existing Community law.\n\n((8)) It is not necessary to impose the requirement to draw up an accounting statement where an issuer whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market publishes half-yearly financial reports in accordance with Directive 2004/109/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 2004 on the harmonisation of transparency requirements in relation to information about issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market(8).\n\n((9)) An independent expert’s report as provided for under Directive 77/91/EEC is often not needed where an independent expert’s report protecting the interests of shareholders or creditors also has to be drawn up in the context of the merger or the division. Member States should therefore have the possibility in such cases of dispensing companies from the reporting requirement under Directive 77/91/EEC or of providing that both reports may be drawn up by the same expert.\n\n((10)) Mergers between parent companies and their subsidiaries have a reduced economic impact on shareholders and creditors where the parent company’s holding in the subsidiary amounts to 90\xa0% or more of the shares and other securities conferring the right to vote. The same applies to certain divisions, in particular when companies are split into new companies that are owned by the shareholders in the proportion to their rights in the company being divided. In those cases, the reporting requirements laid down by Directives 78/855/EEC and 82/891/EEC should therefore be reduced.\n\n((11)) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to reduce administrative burdens relating in particular to publication and documentation obligations of public limited liability companies within the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n((12)) Directives 77/91/EEC, 78/855/EEC, 82/891/EEC and 2005/56/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((13)) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better lawmaking(9), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Amendments to Directive 77/91/EEC', 'text': 'Article 1\nAmendments to Directive 77/91/EEC\nDirective 77/91/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nin Article 1(1), the fourteenth indent is replaced by the following:\n‘—\nin Finland: julkinen osakeyhtiö/publikt aktiebolag’;\n2.\nin Article 10, the following paragraph is added:\n‘5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States may decide not to apply this Article to the formation of a new company by way of merger or division where an independent expert’s report on the draft terms of merger or division is drawn up.\nWhere Member States decide to apply this Article in the cases referred to in the first subparagraph, they may provide that the report under this Article and the independent expert’s report on the draft terms of merger or division may be drawn up by the same expert or experts.’;\n3.\nArticle 27(3) is replaced by the following:\n‘3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States may decide not to apply paragraph 2 in the event of an increase in subscribed capital made in order to give effect to a merger, a division or a public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares and to pay the shareholders of the company which is being absorbed or divided or which is the object of the public offer for the purchase or exchange of shares.\nIn the case of a merger or a division, however, Member States shall apply the first subparagraph only where an independent expert’s report on the draft terms of merger or division is drawn up.\nWhere Member States decide to apply paragraph 2 in the case of a merger or a division, they may provide that the report under this Article and the independent expert’s report on the draft terms of merger or division may be drawn up by the same expert or experts.’.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Amendments to Directive 78/855/EEC', 'text': 'Article 2\nAmendments to Directive 78/855/EEC\nDirective 78/855/EEC is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nin Article 1(1), the fourteenth indent is replaced by the following:\n‘—\nFinland: julkinen osakeyhtiö/publikt aktiebolag’;\n2.\nin Article 6, the following paragraphs are added:\n‘Any of the merging companies shall be exempt from the publication requirement laid down in Article 3 of Directive 68/151/EEC if, for a continuous period beginning at least one month before the day fixed for the general meeting which is to decide on the draft terms of merger and ending not earlier than the conclusion of that meeting, it makes the draft terms of such merger available on its website free of charge for the public.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 20 December 1990  concerning applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (Gantrade (UK) Ltd)  (Only the English,  French and Dutch texts are authentic)  (91/164/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 (2) amended Regulation (EEC) No 1282/81 (3) imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America. Anti-dumping duty of 6 % was applied to the  American company Gantrade Corporation.
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 490/90 (4) repealed Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States. Thus, since 2 March 1990, anti-dumping duty can no  longer be imposed on those imports.
(3) Commission Decision 90/460/EEC (5), which sets out the detailes of the case, the procedure, and the arguments of the applicant, refunded part of the anti-dumping duties paid by Gantrade (UK) Ltd, Bishop's Stortford, United Kingdom, in respect of the  import in the period August 1987 to March 1989 of vinyl acetate monomer exported by the United States company Gantrade Corporation. The Decision stated that Gantrade's applications for the period 1 April 1989 to 1 March 1990, the expiry date of the  anti-dumping duty applied, would be examined before a further decision was taken.
(4) For this second period, Gantrade, which imported into Belgium, submitted recurring applications for a sum of Bfrs [. . .] (6).
(5) The applicant was informed of the results of the examination after the evidence adduced had been verified and had the opportunity to submit its comments.
(6) Pursuant to Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the applications' admissibility and merits. No Member State raised any objection.
B. ADMISSIBILITY
(7) The applications are admissible in that they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular with regard to time limits.
C. MERITS OF THE CLAIM
(8) The recurring applications concerning the duties paid on vinyl acetate monomer imported by Gantrade UK Ltd between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 appear to be well founded. The actual dumping margin, calculated as it had been for Decision 90/460/EEC  using the method used during the first investigation, was nil. Accordingly, the applications for refund submitted by Gantrade (UK) Ltd for imports into the Community between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United  States must be granted.
D. AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED
(9) A total of Bfrs [. . .] is therefore to be refunded to Gantrade (UK) Ltd.","{'title': '91/164/EEC: Commission Decision of 20 December 1990 concerning applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (Gantrade (UK) Ltd) (Only the English, French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe applications for the refund of anti-dumping duties totalling Bfrs [. . .] paid between April 1989 and 1 March 1990 by Gantrade (UK) Ltd are hereby granted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amount set out in Article 1 shall be refunded by the Belgian authorities.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium and Gantrade (UK) Ltd, Bishop's Stortford, United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 1990.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 213, 4. 8. 1987, p. 32.\n\n(3) OJ No L 129, 15. 5. 1981, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ No L 53, 1. 3. 1990, p. 1.\n\n(5) OJ No L 240, 3. 9. 1990, p. 19.\n\n(6) In accordance with Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88,  which deals with the non-disclosure of business secrets, certain figures have been omitted from the published version of this Decision.""}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Until 31 December 2000, Article 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(2), which was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, provided for a compensatory allowance to be granted under certain conditions to Community tuna producer organisations for quantities of tuna delivered to the processing industry during the calendar quarter for which prices had been recorded, where both the average quarterly selling price recorded on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price plus any applicable countervailing charge were lower than 91 % of the Community producer price for the product concerned.
(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market in the year 2000 has shown that between 1 April and 30 June of that year both the average quarterly selling price and the free-at-frontier price as referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing not more than 10 kg each and skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) were lower than 91 % of the Community producer price in force, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2748/1999(3).
(3) The conditions laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 should be retained in order to take a decision on granting the compensatory allowance on the products in question for the period 1 April to 30 June 2000.
(4) Entitlement to the compensatory allowance should be determined on the basis of sales covered by invoices bearing a date falling within the quarter concerned and which have been used to calculate the average monthly selling price referred to in Article 7(1)(b) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2210/93(4), which was repealed with effect from 1 January 2001 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 80/2001(5).

(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 18(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 1997, 1998 and 1999 fishing years.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (1), and in particular Article 497(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In order to avoid disruption to international financial markets and to prevent penalising institutions by subjecting them to higher own funds requirements during the processes of authorisation and recognition of existing central counterparties (‘CCPs’), Article 497(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 established a transitional period during which all CCPs with which institutions established in the Union clear transactions will be considered QCCPs.
(2) Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 also amended Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) in respect of certain inputs to the calculation of institutions' own funds requirements for exposures to CCPs. Accordingly, Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 requires certain CCPs to report, for a limited period of time, the total amount of initial margin they have received from their clearing members. That transitional period mirrors the one laid down in Article 497 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(3) Both the transitional period for own funds requirements set out in Article 497(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and the transitional period for reporting the initial margin set out in the first and second subparagraphs of Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 were set to expire on 15 June 2014.
(4) Article 497(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 empowers the Commission to adopt an implementing act in order to extend the transitional period by six months in exceptional circumstances. That extension should also apply in respect of the time limits laid down in Article 89 (5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 591/2014 (3) has already extended those transitional periods by six months, until 15 December 2014.
(5) The authorisation process for existing CCPs established in the Union has been taking place but will not be completed by 15 December 2014. With regard to existing CCPs established in third countries that have already applied for recognition, for the time being no recognition has been granted yet to such CCPs. A further extension of the transitional period will therefore enable institutions established in the Union (or their subsidiaries established outside the Union) to avoid significant increase in the own funds requirements due to the lack of recognised CCPs established in each of those relevant third countries and providing, in a viable and accessible way, the specific type of clearing services that those Union institutions require.

Accordingly, Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 requires certain CCPs to report, for a limited period of time, the total amount of initial margin they have received from their clearing members. That transitional period mirrors the one laid down in Article 497 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n((3)) Both the transitional period for own funds requirements set out in Article 497(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No\xa0575/2013 and the transitional period for reporting the initial margin set out in the first and second subparagraphs of Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 were set to expire on 15 June 2014.\n\n((4)) Article 497(3) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 empowers the Commission to adopt an implementing act in order to extend the transitional period by six months in exceptional circumstances. That extension should also apply in respect of the time limits laid down in Article 89 (5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 591/2014(3)has already extended those transitional periods by six months, until 15 December 2014.\n\n((5)) The authorisation process for existing CCPs established in the Union has been taking place but will not be completed by 15 December 2014. With regard to existing CCPs established in third countries that have already applied for recognition, for the time being no recognition has been granted yet to such CCPs. A further extension of the transitional period will therefore enable institutions established in the Union (or their subsidiaries established outside the Union) to avoid significant increase in the own funds requirements due to the lack of recognised CCPs established in each of those relevant third countries and providing, in a viable and accessible way, the specific type of clearing services that those Union institutions require. While such an increase may only be temporary, it could potentially lead to their withdrawal as direct participants in those CCPs and hence cause disruption in the markets in which those CCPs operate. An additional six-month extension of the transitional periods, i.e. until 15 June 2015, is therefore necessary.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Banking Committee"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe 15-month periods referred to in Article 497(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and in the first and second subparagraph of Article 89(5a) of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, respectively, as already extended pursuant to Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 591/2014, are extended by an additional 6 months.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (1), and in particular Articles 6, 7 and 8 thereof;
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) In view of the reduced availability of veterinary medicinal products for certain food-producing species (2), maximum residue limits may be established by methods of extrapolation from maximum residue limits set for other species on a strictly scientific basis.
(5) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(6) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(7) Albendazole, Febantel, Fenbendazole, Oxfendazole, Thiabendazole, Oxyclozanide, Amitraz, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin and Dexamethasone should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
(8) An adequate period should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC (3) of the European Parliament and of the Council to take account of the provisions of this Regulation.

(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/94 of 12 December 1994 opening and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals falling within CN code 0202 and products falling within CN code 0206 29 21  (first semester 1995) (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas Regulation (EC) No 3072/94 lays down the method for administering the Community tariff quota for frozen beef falling within CN code 0202 and for products falling within CN code 0206 29 91 and splits that quota into two parts, one of 21 200  tonnes apportioned between traditional importers and the other of 5 300 tonnes apportioned between operators who have been engaged in trade in beef with third countries;
Whereas, in order to ensure a smooth switchover from arrangements based on national administration to Community-administered arrangements, while bearing in mind the special aspects of trade in the products in question, provision should be made for the  allocation of the first part on the one hand to traditional importers in proportion to the quantities imported under the same type of quota in the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 and, on the other hand, to importers in the new Member States; whereas in the  case of imports made by the latter, with a view to establishing the reference quantities, a coefficient corresponding to the Community level of traditional imports for GATT purposes compared to total imports of frozen beef should be applied;
Whereas, on the basis of the submission of applications from interested parties and subject to their acceptance by the Commission up to a certain limit, importers who can demonstrate the genuine nature of their business and who apply for quantities of  some significance should be granted access to the second part; whereas verification of these criteria requires that applications be submitted in the Member State in which the importer is registered;
Whereas operators no longer engaged in trade in beef and veal at 1 January 1995 should be barred access to the quota in order to prevent speculation;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2746/94 (3), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural  products; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1084/94 (5), lays down special detailed rules for applying the system of import licences for beef and veal;
Whereas restricting the arrangements in question to the first six months shortens the time limit for imports; whereas this time limit should be extended by one month as a transitional measure;
Whereas the effective management of this quota and in particular the prevention of fraud require that the licences used are returned to the competent authorities in order that they may verify that the quantities shown therein are correct; whereas, to  that end, an obligation should be imposed on the competent authorities to carry out such verification; whereas the amount of the security to be lodged on the issue of the licences should be fixed in such a way as to ensure that the licences are used and  returned to the competent authorities;
Whereas provision should be made for the Member States to forward information on the import arrangements in question;
Whereas the Management Committee for Beef and Veal has not delivered an opinion wihtin the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 3305/94 of 23 December 1994 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/94 with regard to the import arrangements for frozen beef falling within CN code 0202 and products falling within CN code 0206 29 91', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas the Commission is required to select, as between the two procedures under Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC for attesting for conformity of a product, the 'least onerous possible procedure consistent with safety`; whereas this means that it is necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria mentioned in Article 13(4), the intervention of an approved certification body is therefore required;
Whereas Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined must be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications; whereas, therefore, it is desirable to define the concept of products or family of products as used in the mandates and in the technical specifications;
Whereas the two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) are described in detail in Annex III to Directive 89/106/EEC; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures must be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems;
Whereas the procedure referred to in Article 13(3)(a) corresponds to the systems set out in the first possibility, without continuous surveillance, and the second and third possibilities of point (ii) of section 2 of Annex III, and the procedure referred to in Article 13(3)(b) corresponds to the systems set out in point (i) of section 2 of Annex III, and in the first possibility, with continuous surveillance, of point (ii) of section 2 of Annex III;

(2) Article 2(1)(b) of that Regulation provides that derived intervention prices for white sugar are to be fixed for each deficit area each year. When those prices are fixed, account is to be taken of the regional variations in the price of sugar, which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, may be expected to occur under natural conditions of price formation on the market and in view of experience gained and the costs of transporting sugar from surplus areas to deficit areas.
(3) To establish whether an area is a deficit area, projections should be made on the basis of the data returned by the Member States relating both to the current marketing year as regards consumption trends, and to the prospects for the coming marketing year as regards developments in available production. As a result, areas should be recognised as deficit areas only where the projections clearly indicate that a deficit is likely to occur.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2), and in particular Articles 9, 13 and 14 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 31 August 1996, by Regulation (EC) No 1717/96 (3), the Commission initiated an investigation into the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by the Council Regulation (EEC) No 993/93 of 26 April 1993 (4) on imports of certain retail electronic weighing scales (hereinafter 'REWS`) originating in Japan by imports of the same product assembled in and/or transhipped through Indonesia, and it directed customs authorities, pursuant to Article 14 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter the 'Basic Regulation`), to register imports from Indonesia of the product covered by this investigation.
(2) The investigation was initiated following a request, pursuant to Article 13 (3) of the Basic Regulation, lodged on behalf of the Community industry by the following companies:
- Bizerba GmbH & Co KG,
- Campesa SA,
- Dataprocess Industria SpA,
- Testut SA,
- Lutrana SA,
- GEC Avery Limited,
- Maatschappij van Berkel's Patent BV,
- Breveti van Berkel SpA.
(3) The request contained evidence, in accordance with Article 13 (3) of the Basic Regulation, that the anti-dumping duty on imports of REWS produced by TEC Corporation, Tokyo (5) (hereinafter 'TEC`) and originating in Japan could be being circumvented by assembly operations in and/or transhipments through Indonesia of REWS subsequently exported to the Community. The evidence was considered to be sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.
(4) The product under consideration consists of electronic weighing scales for use in the retail trade which incorporate a digital display of the weight, unit price and price to be paid, whether or not including a means of printing this data (hereinafter referred to as 'REWS`). REWS are currently classified within CN code ex 8423 81 50.
(5) The investigation covered the period 1 July 1995 to 30 June 1996.
(6) The following companies cooperated in the investigation and submitted satisfactory replies to the questionnaires:
- TEC Corporation (Japan) (exporter),
- PT TEC Indonesia (hereinafter TEC Indonesia) (assembler),
- TEC Elektronic GMBH (related importer),
- TEC UK Ltd (related importer),
- TEC France International SA (related importer),
- TEC Belgium SA (related importer).
Companies which requested to be heard within the time limits set by Regulation (EC) No 1717/96 were granted a hearing. The Commission advised the authorities of Japan, Singapore and Indonesia and held consultations with representatives of Indonesia.
The Indonesian company mentioned in the request, PT Kahar Duta Sarana (Jakarta, Indonesia), informed the Commission that it distributed REWS on the Indonesian market but that it dit not export REWS to the European Community. Consequently it did not reply to the questionnaire.
B. INVESTIGATION
(7) The first sentence of Article 13 (1) of the Basic Regulation provides for anti-dumping duties in force to be extended to imports of finished products from third countries when circumvention of the measures is taking place. The investigation showed that the operation in Indonesia consisted of an assembly-operation of REWS. Article 13 (2) of the Basic Regulation specifies the conditions under which an assembly operation shall be considered to circumvent measures in force.
C. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. Nature of the circumvention practice
(8) The investigation has established that TEC Corporation (Japan) assembles REWS in Indonesia through its subsidiary, TEC Indonesia, some of those assembled REWS being exported to the Community. The assembly of REWS in Indonesia started in May 1994 on Batham Island (Indonesia), a free trade area located close to Singapore.
The Commission verified that TEC Indonesia, already established in July 1992, is fully owned by TEC Singapore Electronics Ltd (hereinafter TEC Singapore) which in turn is fully owned by TEC Corporation (Japan). It produces electronic equipment, among which REWS, under a licence agreement with TEC Singapore. TEC Indonesia was found to be, de facto, a workshop of TEC Singapore and both companies are consequently considered, for the purpose of the investigation, to constitute a single economic entity.
(9) TEC Indonesia procures all the parts used for the assembly of REWS from TEC Singapore. TEC Singapore buys parts from Japan (inter alia, from its mother company TEC Corporation), from Singapore and from third countries. In addition, TEC Singapore mounts printed circuit boards (PCBs) which are sold, among others, to TEC Indonesia.
The REWS, once assembled by TEC Indonesia, are sold to TEC Singapore which in its turn sells these to TEC Corporation (Japan). The latter takes care of the export administration (marketing and invoicing) as regards, inter alia, the Community. Physically, the REWS are shipped to the Community from Indonesia.
(10) The Indonesian company mentioned in the complaint (PT Kahar Duta Sarana) is the domestic distributor of TEC REWS in Indonesia. Sales of TEC REWS to PT Kahar Duta Sarana during the investigation period were limited in quantity and it was verified that these sales were only destined to the Indonesian market.
The major part of the TEC REWS exported to the Community during the investigation period were sold to the four related importers listed above (recital (6)). The remainder were sold to independent distributors in the Community.
2. Conditions of Article 13 (2) of the Basic Regulation
(i) Start or substantial increase of operations
(11) The assembly of TEC REWS by TEC Indonesia started in May 1994, i.e. after the initiation of the anti-dumping investigation in 1991 (notice of initiation published on 26 February 1991 (6) that led to the imposition of the original measures in April 1993. It was found that no TEC REWS were assembled by TEC Indonesia prior to May 1994.
The export of the Indonesian assembled REWS to the Community appears to have grown from zero in May 1994 to 5 114 units during the investigation period.
(ii) 60 % rule on the total value of the parts of the assembled product
(12) The value of parts has been calculated in respect of REWS assembled in Indonesia which were exported to the Community during the investigation period.
(13) All elements, material or immaterial (such as software) purchased by TEC Indonesia to be incorporated into the REWS have been considered as parts. Any element manufactured, assembled or developed by TEC Indonesia or TEC Singapore (as these companies are considered as a single economic entity) to be incorporated into the REWS has been considered as an individual part where its manufacture, assembly or development could not be reversed to any extent without significantly diminishing the value of that element.
It was found that it was feasible to dismantle all sub-assemblies, other than the load cells, to a prior level of assembly without significantly diminishing their value. The value added resulting from the assembly of these sub-assemblies has been accounted for under the 25 % value added test (see below).
(14) Printed circuit boards (PCBs) assembled by TEC Singapore and sold to TEC Indonesia for the assembly of REWS exported to the Community have been brought to the level of assembly immediately prior to the mounting of the stuffings (i.e. electronic components) into the bare board. Consequently the value of parts purchased by TEC Singapore for the assembly of these PCBs, has been considered for the calculation of the 60/40 % test, according to their respective origins.
The value of load cells (which it appeared impossible to disassemble without causing significant material damage to the components and consequent diminution in its value) has therefore been calculated as the cost of parts as brought in plus direct labour cost plus manufacturing overheads.
(15) The weighted average value of parts of Japanese origin incorporated into TEC REWS assembled by TEC Indonesia and sold to the Community during the investigation period was found to exceed the 60 % threshold.
(16) However, it has also been found that, in April 1996 (towards the end of the investigation period), TEC Japan transferred to Indonesia the production of an important part for the two models of REWS that are exported to the Community. This transfer led to a considerable reduction of the value of parts of Japanese origin incorporated in the REWS manufactured by TEC Indonesia which, at the end of the investigation period, was far below the 60 % threshold. In this respect, it should be noted that the value of parts of Japanese origin incorporated in each individual model was also less than 60 % at the end of the investigation period.
(17) Although, as a rule, the situation during the whole period of investigation is used as a basis for the decision on whether measures are to be taken, the Commission took into consideration in this case the very substantial decrease of the percentage of Japanese parts that occurred at the end of the investigation period, that the production of an important part for REWS had been transferred to Indonesia, and that this decrease in the percentage of Japanese parts used in REWS assembled by TEC Indonesia is likely to be maintained as it results from a change in the production pattern which it would be uneconomic to reverse.
(18) Under these particular circumstances, the Commission considers that the TEC assembly operation in Indonesia should be considered not to meet the parts value requirement of Article 13 (2) (b).
(iii) 25 % rule: value added
(19) The weighted average value added brought in to the parts used for the assembly of the REWS exported to the Community by TEC Indonesia has been found to be far below the 25 % threshold of Article 13 (2) (b). Incidentally, the Commission also noted that the sum of the value of the parts of Indonesian origin, plus the value added to the parts brought into the assembly operation, plus the SG& A and the profit of TEC Indonesia, only represented a small part of the ex-factory (TEC Indonesia) price of REWS.
D. TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION
(20) In the light of the above findings it appears appropriate to terminate the present investigation without extending the existing anti-dumping measures. The registration of imports of REWS from Indonesia introduced by Regulation (EC) No 1717/96 should therefore cease and that Regulation will be repealed.
(21) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objections.
(22) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the investigation and were given the opportunity to comment and their comments have been considered,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 985/97 of 30 May 1997 terminating the investigation concerning the circumvention of definitive anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 993/93 on imports of certain retail electronic weighing scales originating in Japan by imports of the same product assembled in and/or transhipped through Indonesia, and ceasing registration of this product', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe investigation concerning the circumvention of the anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 993/93 on imports of certain retail electronic weighing scales originating in Japan by imports of the same product assembled in and/or transhipped through Indonesia initiated by Regulation (EC) No 1717/96 is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1717/96 is hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 May 1997.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nLeon BRITTAN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 56, 6. 3. 1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 317, 6. 12. 1996, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ No L 221, 31. 8. 1996, p. 47.\n\n(4) OJ No L 104, 29. 4. 1993, p. 4.\n\n(5) By Regulation (EEC) No 993/93 of 26 April 1993 the Council imposed, inter alia, a definitive individual duty of 22,5 % on REWS produced by Tokyo Electric Co.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (1), and in particular Article 10(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Reducing the administrative burden imposed on enterprises by existing Community legislation is a crucial element for improving their competitiveness and for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon agenda.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 lays down specific rules on the hygiene of food of animal origin for food business operators. That Regulation provides that food business operators are to comply with the relevant provisions of Annex III thereto.
(3) The requirements of Section VIII of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 as regards vessels engaged in primary production and associated operations supplement those laid down in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2). In particular, those vessels are to keep and retain records relating to measures put in place to control hazards in an appropriate manner and for an appropriate period.
(4) Experience has shown that for food business operators involved in small-scale coastal fishing within the meaning of Article 26 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 of 27 July 2006 on the European Fisheries Fund (3), that requirement may create an additional administrative burden. It is therefore appropriate to provide for a derogation from that requirement for such operators.
(5) Section XIV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 sets out the requirements for the production of gelatine intended for human consumption. It specifies that when manufactured from ruminant bone material, gelatine must be produced using a unique process that ensures that all bone material is subjected to an alkaline treatment of saturated lime solution (pH > 12,5) for a period of at least 20 days with a heat treatment step of 138 °C minimum during at least four seconds, after having been finely crushed and degreased with hot water and treated with dilute hydrochloric acid (at minimum concentration of 4 % and pH < 1,5) over a period of at least two days.
(6) The Scientific Panel on Biological Hazards of the European Food Safety Authority adopted on 18 January 2006 an opinion on the ‘Quantitative assessment of the human BSE risk posed by gelatine with respect to residual BSE risk’. On 18 May 2006, it adopted another opinion on the ‘Quantitative assessment of the human BSE risk posed by bovine vertebral column including dorsal root ganglia with respect to residual BSE risk’. According to both opinions, the production processes involving an acid process or a heat and pressure process ensure respectively equivalent and higher BSE infectivity reduction compared to the safety level achieved by applying the alkaline process currently required by Section XIV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004. The conditions for the production of gelatine should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) There have been difficulties in interpreting provisions on possible other use of gelatine and collagen produced in accordance with the provisions laid down in Sections XIV and XV of Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 in some Member States. It is therefore appropriate to clarify those provisions in order to harmonise their implementation.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (1), of 1992, introducing specific measures for the Canary Islands concerning certain agricultural products; and in particular Article 3 (4) and 4 (4) hereof,
Whereas in application of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, it is necessary to determine for the pigmeat sector and for the 1992/93 marketing year, on the one hand, the quantities of meat and processed products of the forecast  supply balance which benefit from an exemption for the levy on direct imports from third countries or from an aid for deliveries originating from the rest of the Community, and on the other hand, the quantities of pure-bred breeding animals originating  in the Community which benefit from an aid with a view to developing the potential for production in the archipelago of the Canaries;
Whereas it is appropriate to fix the amount of the aids referred to above for the supply to the archipelago, on the one hand, in meat and, on the other hand, of breeding animals originating in the rest of the Community; whereas these aids must be fixed  taking into account in particular the costs of supply from the world market, conditions due to the geographical situation of the archipelago and the basis of the current prices on export to third countries for the animals or products concerned;
Whereas the common detailed implementing rules for the supply regime for the Canary Islands for certain agricultural products were laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1695/92 (2); whereas it is appropriate to lay down complementary implementing  rules adjusted in the light of current commercial practices in the pigmeat sector in particular regarding the duration of the validity of import certificates and the aid, the amount of the securities ensuring compliance with their obligations by  operators;
Whereas with view to efficiently managing the supply regime, it is necessary to provide for a time limit for the making of requests for certificates and a period of reflection for the delivery of the latter;
Whereas in application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92, the supply regime is applicable from 1 July 1992; whereas it is necessary to provide for application of the detailed implementing rules from the same date;

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '29.9.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 270/60', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 1434/2006\nof 28 September 2006\nfixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other.

Whereas, according to Articles 6 and 18 of the Annex to Council Regulation 691/86 of 3 March 1986 establishing arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP States) on the other (3), the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall postpone implementation of the preferential arrangements for fruit and vegetables falling within Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (4) until 31 December 1989 and 31 December 1990 respectively; whereas, consequently, the present Regulation applies only to the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985;
Whereas the application of ceilings requires the Community to be regularly informed of the trend of imports of the relevant products originating in these countries; whereas imports should, therefore, be made subject to a system of surveillance;
Whereas this objective may be achieved by means of an administrative procedure based on offsetting imports of the products in question against the ceilings at Community level as and when these products are entered with customs authorities for free circulation; whereas this administrative procedure must make provision for the possible re-establishment of customs tariff duties as soon as the ceilings are reached at Community level;
Whereas this administrative procedure requires close and particularly swift cooperation between the Member States and the Commission; whereas the latter must, in particular, be able to follow the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed; whereas this cooperation has to be particularly close since the Commission must be able to take the appropriate measures to re-establish customs tariff duties if one of the ceilings is reached;

Whereas reference methods for the determination of stigmasterol and sitosterol in butteroil and in butter have been established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3942/92 (3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2539/93 (4), and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 86/94 (5) respectively; whereas a reference method for the determination of the ethylester of beta-apo-8' carotenic acid in concentrated butter and butter has been established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1082/96 (6) and a reference method for the determination of vanillin in concentrated butter, butter or cream has been established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1459/98 (7);
Whereas the reference methods mentioned above were introduced for the control of compliance with conditions relating to the tracing of butter, butteroil and cream under certain schemes under which these products are subsidised; whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of an aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice-cream and other foodstuffs (8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1982/98 (9) which repealed and replaced Commission Regulation (EEC) No 570/88 (10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 531/96 (11), changed the tolerance limits relating to the incorporation of tracers which had previously been applicable;

Whereas:
(1) Under Directive 2000/29/EC, plants, plant products or other objects listed in that Directive, coming from third countries, are in principle to be accompanied by the original of the required official ‘phytosanitary certificate’ or ‘phytosanitary certificate for re-export’ (certificates).
(2) The International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) of 6 December 1951 concluded at the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) specifies in its Annex models of certificates providing a standard wording and format that should be followed for the preparation and issue of certificates.
(3) The IPPC was significantly amended in 1979 and 1997. As a consequence of those amendments different models of the certificates were approved to accompany plants, plant products and other objects when moving in international traffic.
(4) Although the amendments of the IPPC in 1997 have not yet entered into force, Resolution 12/97 of the 29th session of the Conference of the FAO allowed the use of the amended certificates as an alternative and on voluntary basis among Contracting Parties to the IPPC that accept them. It appeared that many Contracting Parties to the IPPC already use the certificates based on the models specified in the Annex to the IPPC, as amended in 1997.
(5) The models of certificates to accompany plants, plant products or other objects for entry into the Community should be determined.
(6) National plant protection organisations usually stock up certificates in large quantities. It is appropriate to lay down rules for the use of certificates based on the models specified in the Annex to IPPC, as amended in 1979, during a transitional period.

Whereas the object of that levy was to achieve better balance on the market for milk by establishing a more direct link between production and the possibilities of disposing of milk products, in view of the importance of the public interests involved;  whereas the data and forecasts at present available show that the abovementioned objectives will probably not be attained before the end of the period laid down; whereas the application of that Regulation should therefore be extended for the 1992/93  milk year;
