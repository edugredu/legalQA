Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 865/2004 of 29 April 2004 on the common organisation of the market in olive oil and table olives and amending Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 (1), and in particular Article 5(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 (2) provides for a system designating certain optional references for olive oils. Under Article 5(c) of that Regulation, indications of the organoleptic properties of virgin olive oils may appear on the labelling only if they are based on the results of a method of analysis provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91 of 11 July 1991 on the characteristics of olive oil and olive-residue oil and on the relevant methods of analysis (3).
(2) Under the tenth indent of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2568/91, organoleptic characteristics are to be evaluated in accordance with the method set out in Annex XII to that Regulation. Only the positive attributes listed in that Annex may be used. However, because of the very small number of organoleptic attributes listed in that Annex, traders are experiencing difficulties in describing the organoleptic characteristics of their virgin olive oils on labels.
(3) The International Olive Oil Council’s work to find new organoleptic evaluation methods that expand the range of positive attributes of virgin olive oils has now been concluded for extra virgin olive oils enjoying protected designation of origin status. Work is still continuing for virgin olive oils without protected designation of origin status.
(4) In order to allow the more exhaustive vocabulary necessary for better describing the wide range of varieties and tastes of virgin olive oils without protected designation of origin status, a new deadline should be laid down that is sufficient to permit the implementation of an organoleptic evaluation method that expands the range of positive attributes of virgin olive oils, with the exception of those with protected designation of origin status.
(5) The date of application of Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 should therefore be postponed to the date on which the 2008/09 marketing year commences.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 should therefore be amended.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Olive Oil and Table Olives,","{'header': '8.7.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 187/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1044/2006\nof 7 July 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002 on marketing standards for olive oil', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1019/2002(2)provides for a system designating certain optional references for olive oils.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 144(1) in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 11(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (2) provides certain rules as regards notifications of the Member States to the Commission. Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 applies without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations which might be laid down by the sectoral regulations. It is appropriate to provide, in Commission Regulations specific to certain quotas in the beef and veal sector, for more detailed rules on notifications concerning import licences in that sector. In particular, in order to clarify the obligations related to the closing date for notifications relating to quantities covered by import licences, such obligations should be laid down for each import tariff quota concerned and it is therefore necessary to derogate from the second subparagraph of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 on that point. The following Regulations should be amended accordingly:
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 297/2003 of 17 February 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of the tariff quota for beef and veal originating in Chile (3),
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 of 8 December 2004 laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland (4),
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 2172/2005 of 23 December 2005 laying down detailed rules for the application of an import tariff quota for live bovine animals of a weight exceeding 160 kg and originating in Switzerland provided for in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (5),
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 529/2007 of 11 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen meat of bovine animals covered by CN code 0202 and products covered by CN code 0206 29 91 (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008) (6),
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 545/2007 of 16 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for frozen beef intended for processing (1 July 2007 to 30 June 2008) (7),
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 558/2007 of 23 May 2007 opening and providing for the administration of an import tariff quota for young male bovine animals for fattening (8), and
— Commission Regulation (EC) No 659/2007 of 14 June 2007 opening and providing for the administration of import tariff quotas for bulls, cows and heifers other than for slaughter of certain Alpine and mountain breeds (9).
(2) The import tariff quota opened by Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004 is managed on the basis of documents issued by the third country concerned. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify that the provisions of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2092/2004, without prejudice to additional conditions laid down in that Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28 January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products(1), as last amended by Directive 98/45/EC(2), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) By means of Decision 2002/304/EC(3), the Commission approved the programmes with a view to obtaining the status of approved zones and of approved farms in non-approved zones with regard to one or more of the fish diseases viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) and infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN), including a programme for all continental and coastal areas of Finland.
(2) Due to outbreaks of VHS in certain coastal areas, Finland has submitted amendments to its programme. The programme hereby provides for specific eradication measures for VHS in the affected coastal areas, with the final view to obtaining approved zone status as regards VHS and IHN for all continental and coastal areas of Finland. The programme includes non-discriminatory restrictions on movements of fish in order to prevent re-introduction of the diseases in question.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (2), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 394/96 (3) (hereinafter 'the provisional duty Regulation`), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of polyester staple fibre (hereinafter 'PSF` or 'product concerned`) originating in Belarus, falling within CN code 5503 2000.
(2) By Regulation (EC) No 1050/96 (4) the Council extended the validity of this duty for a period of two months.
B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE
(3) The provisional duty Regulation set up a time limit within which the parties concerned could make known their views in writing and apply to be heard orally by the Commission.
(4) Only the sole Belarussian exporter concerned requested, within that time limit, and was granted a hearing.
(5) 'Eurofibrefill`, an association formed by a group of users of PSF, made known its views in writing nearly three months following the entry into force of the provisional duty Regulation, and hence after the abovementioned time limit. In any event, no arguments different from those previously made by Eurofibrefill in the course of the investigation, and covered by the provisional duty Regulation, were contained in the new submission.
C. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION AND LIKE PRODUCT, DUMPING, COMMUNITY INDUSTRY, INJURY, CAUSATION OF INJURY AND COMMUNITY INTEREST
(6) No further substantiated arguments have been made by any of the parties concerned regarding the Commission's provisional findings on the product concerned, on the like product, on dumping, Community industry, injury, causation of injury and Community interest. Consequently, these findings, as set out in recitals 10 to 78 of the provisional duty Regulation, are confirmed by the Council.
D. FORM OF A DEFINITIVE MEASURE TO BE IMPOSED
(7) During the hearing granted to the Belarussian exporter (see recital 4), the latter enquired about the possibility of offering a price-undertaking, so that the investigation could be terminated without the imposition of definitive duties. However, no such offer has subsequently been made.
(8) For the following reasons, a price-undertaking does not appear to be an appropriate solution in the present case:
(a) minimum prices of PSF would have to be linked to the considerable price fluctuations of its main raw materials on the international markets, which would make an undertaking unworkable;
(b) the product concerned is extremely hetero-geneous. An efficient monitoring of an undertaking, which should comprise all different types and combinations of PSF (factors like size, colour, cutlength, shading, etc. are all decisive for setting a selling price), would be extremely difficult. The risk of circumvention would be considerable;
(c) the low level of cooperation found during the investigation, as demonstrated by the fact that the exporter concerned submitted evidence for only 2 % of the total quantity of PSF imported into the Community from Belarus, would increase this risk even more.
(9) In these circumstances it is considered that the most suitable form of any definitive measure to be imposed in the present proceeding would therefore be an ad valorem duty. The Council confirms this approach.
E. DEFINITIVE DUTY
(10) In order to establish the level of the definitive duty, the Commission took account of the dumping margin found and of the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury sustained by the Community industry, in accordance with the methodology described in recitals 79 to 81 of the provisional duty Regulation.
(11) Since the increase in export prices necessary to remove the injury suffered by the Community industry is greater than the dumping margin found, the definitive duty to be imposed should correspond to the dumping margin established, i.e. 43,5 %. The Council confirms this level of the definitive duty.
F. COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL DUTY
(12) In view of the dumping margin established and the substantial injury caused to the Community industry, it is considered that the amounts secured by way of the provisional anti-dumping duty should be definitively collected,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1490/96 of 23 July 1996 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polyester staple fibre originating in Belarus and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3042/78 (4), provides that the amount of the levy for Community sugar shall be calculated by dividing the total estimated reimbursement by the estimated quantity of sugar which will be marketed during the sugar marketing year in question; whereas the total estimated reimbursement is to be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by the amounts carried forward from previous marketing years;
Whereas Article 8 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the monthly reimbursement amount shall be fixed by the Council simultaneously with the derived intervention prices; whereas that amount of reimbursement envisaged for 1997/1998 should be used for the purpose of calculating the amounts of the levy;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1358/77, the quantity in store to be taken into account for the reimbursement of any one month's storage costs is equal to the arithmetic mean of the quantities held in store in the beginning and at the end of the month in question; whereas, for the 1997/1998 marketing year, the quantities of Community sugar in store each month may be estimated by reference to estimated stocks at the beginning of the marketing year, estimated monthly production and the quantities likely to be marketed for domestic consumption or exported during the same month; whereas total average monthly stocks during the 1997/1998 marketing year can be estimated at approximately 104 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar; whereas the total reimbursement for Community sugar can thus be estimated at approximately ECU 395 million for the 1997/1998 marketing year; whereas the balance of previous sugar marketing years can be estimated at a positive amount of ECU 117 million; whereas the detailed rules for the application of the system of offsetting storage costs for sugar provide that the levy is to be fixed per 100 kilograms of white sugar; whereas the quantity of Community sugar which will be marketed during the 1997/1998 marketing year for home consumption or for export may be estimated at approximately 14 million tonnes of sugar expressed as white sugar; whereas the amount of the levy for Community sugar should therefore be ECU 2,00 per 100 kilograms of white sugar;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 26(3) and Article 29(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3(a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1374/98 of 29 June 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the import arrangements and opening tariff quotas for milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1998/2000(4), lays down that the classification of certain cheeses is subject to the presentation of a licence issued in accordance with Article 23. Article 23(3) and (4) clearly state that the headings concerned are reserved exclusively for preferential imports from Switzerland under the special arrangements that the Community has concluded with that country. Given that IMA 1 certificates are no longer used when those products are imported, Article 3(b) no longer makes any sense. In the interests of clarity, Article 3 should therefore be updated.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98 permits operators to submit a licence application for each CN code under the ""minimum access"" quotas referred to in Annex II. This has resulted in excessive numbers of applications, leading to a heavy workload for the competent departments of the Member States and the Commission and financial costs to operators. The provisions concerned should be amended to restrict operators to just one application per serial number.
(3) Article 21 of Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98, which lays down the detailed rules for the application of the non-quota preferential import arrangements, lists the products covered by those arrangements. CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06, which are covered, inter alia, by Council Decision 69/352/EEC of 6 October 1969 concluding a tariff agreement with Switzerland concerning certain cheeses listed in position ex 4.04 of the Common Customs Tariff(5) and listed in Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1374/98, are not listed in Article 21. An addition should therefore be made to Article 21 and it should be stipulated that ""BergkĂ¤se"" cheese falling within CN codes 0406 90 02 to 0406 90 06 is not covered by the said tariff agreement.
(4) Article 1 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000(7), provides for the import of milk and milk products into the Community without quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect and with exemption from customs duties and charges having equivalent effect. Those exceptional measures go beyond the concessions granted to those countries in the form of reduced duties laid down in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1374/98. Those countries should be deleted from that Annex and consequently from Annex VII.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry(1), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Decision 95/465/ECSC of 19 July 1995 approving the French coal industry's plan for the reduction of activity(2),
Whereas:
I
(1) By letters of 31 July 1997, 13 August 1998 and 10 May 1999, France notified the Commission, in accordance with Article 9(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of the financial aid which it proposed to grant to the coal industry for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively.
(2) The Commission noted that the aid as notified by France, which consisted of direct subsidies under the general State budget and capital injections from a special Treasury account, did not enable the operating losses for the current production to be covered. The outstanding amount of the losses for the three years has been covered, according to a memorandum from the French authorities of 25 March 1998, by loan issues floated by Charbonnages de France on the financial market.
(3) In its letter of formal notice to France of 26 July 1999(3), the Commision considered that the conditions under which these loan issues were floated and the close links which exist between Charbonnages de France and the French authorities suggested that the loan issues floated by the company were tacitly guaranteed by the French State. The letter of formal notice in particular stated that the financial position of Charbonnages de France does not allow it to borrow on the financial market on the basis of ordinary law without at least a tacit guarantee from the State. Charbonnages de France has planned to cease all mining activity in 2005. By that date, it is not merely unlikely that it will have repaid the loans currently outstanding, but it may have issued others, both because the mining operations are structurally loss-making and to repay previous loans. The Commission therefore considered that these loans constituted aid within the meaning of Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
(4) France confirmed the Commission's position in a letter of 26 October 1999 in reply to the letter of formal notice of 26 July 1999 and expressly stated that the loan issues floated by Charbonnages de France could be regarded as issued on behalf of the French State. Several convergent factors also suggest the existence of an implicit guarantee by the French State for the loan issues floated by Charbonnages de France, in particular the fact that, as indicated by the French authorities in their letter of 26 October 1999, the status of CDF (Charbonnages de France) as a public undertaking means its rights and obligations are transferred to the State once it has been wound up and will entail the French State taking over the undertaking's debt when it is wound up after mining activities cease in 2005.
(5) The Commission therefore concludes that the part of the loan issues floated by Charbonnages de France to cover the balance of the operating losses for 1997, 1998 and 1999 which are not covered by direct subsidies and capital injections constitutes aid within the meaning of Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
(6) In the light of the above and the information communicated by France, the Commission is required to take a decision, pursuant to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, on the following financial measures:
(a) for 1997:
- aid amounting to FRF 2489 million for the reduction of activity to cover operating losses,
- aid amounting to FRF 3869 million to cover exceptional costs;
(b) for 1998:
- aid amounting to FRF 2578 million for the reduction of activity to cover operating losses,
- aid amounting to FRF 4059 million to cover exceptional costs;
(c) for 1999:
- aid amounting to FRF 2369 million for the reduction of activity to cover operating losses,
- aid amounting to FRF 4135 million to cover exceptional costs.
(7) The financial measures envisaged by France for its coal industry are covered by Article 1 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and must therefore be approved by the Commission in accordance with Article 9, which refers in particular to the general objectives and criteria laid down in Article 2 and the specific criteria set out in Articles 4 and 5 of the above Decision. In its assessment, the Commission checks, in accordance with Article 9(6) of the Decision, whether the measures are in conformity with the plans for the reduction of activity which have been approved by the Commission.
II
(8) The sums of FRF 2489 million, FRF 2578 million and FRF 2369 million which France is proposing to grant to the coal industry under Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC for the years 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively are intended to cover the difference between the production cost and the selling price of coal freely agreed between the contracting parties in the light of the prevailing conditions on the world market for coal of similar quality from third countries. This aid forms part of the plan for the reduction of activitiy by the company, which plans to cease all mining activities in 2005. In view of the exceptional social and regional consequences of the reduction of activity by the company, the French Government, in agreement with the two sides of industry, has decided to stagger the closures up to 2005.
(9) Although coal production has been reduced from 5,361 million tce(4) in 1997 to 3,673 million tce in 1999, a reduction of 30 %, the Commission notes that the amount af aid has remained relatively stable over this period. The fall in coal prices on the international markets and the rise in the production costs - from FRF 825 per tce in 1997 to FRF 975 per tce in 1999 - have neutralised the effect of reducing the volume of production to the overall amount of aid. This trend in the cost of mining coal merely serves to confirm France's decision to cease all mining by 2005.
(10) In accordance with Article 3(1) of the above Decision, the Commission has checked that, for the coal mining years 1997 and 1998, the aid notified per tonne does not exceed for each production unit the difference between production costs and actual revenue. The Commission has checked for the coal mining year 1999 that the aid notified by tonne does not exceed for each production unit the difference between production costs and foreseeable revenue.
(11) The Commission has furthermore checked whether, in accordance with Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the aid proposed by France has been entered in the Member State's national, regional or local public budgets or channelled through strictly equivalent mechanisms. As the direct subsidies from the general State budget and the capital injections have been entered in the Treasury's special allocation account, these two categories of aid do comply with the requirements of Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. For the loan issues floated by Charbonnages de France, France has informed the Commission, in its letter of 26 October 1999, that the French State will accept responsibility for the interest on these loans from 2000 onwards. The interest on these loans due for 1998 and 1999 has been covered by loan issues floated for those years. As the French authorities have provided the Commission with proof, by letter of 3 July 2000, that the interest due for the year 2000 is entered in the State budget for 1999, the Commission considers that the loans meet the requirement of Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. In accordance with the seventh recital of point III of the above Decision, the requirement in Article 2(2) is intended to provide the best guarantees of transparency in the aid systems. As the interest due for the year 2000 has been budgeted for, that objective may be regarded as fulfilled in as much as the interest is accessory to the sum of the loans. As the loan interest is budgeted for, the sum itself of the loans complies ipso facto with the objective of the transparency of aid in Article 2(2) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
(12) In accordance with Article 2(1), second indent, the aid helps to solve the social and regional problems created by total or partial reductions in the activity of production units.
(13) Except for the sum of FRF 35 million for the year 1997, and the sum of FRF 45 million for each of the years 1998 and 1999, on the basis of the information provided by France, the aid proposed for these three years is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market. The Commission will subsequently take a decision on the balances of FRF 35 million for 1997 and FRF 45 million for the years 1998 and 1999, in particular in the light of France's replies to the questions in the Commission's letter of formal notice of 9 February 1999 in the context of complaint No 97/4717 of 26 August 1997 against Charbonnages de France, which has been lodged by five French undertakings, including the company Thion et Cie.
(14) This Decision is also without prejudice to the decision which the Commission will be required to take after consideration of the complaints submitted against Charbonnages de France, in particular Cokes de Drocourt SA, in the context of the coke market.
III
(15) The sums of FRF 3869 million, FRF 4059 million and FRF 4135 million which France proposes to grant to its coal industry for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively are intended to cover exceptional costs due to modernisation, rationalisation and the restructuring of the coal industry which are not related to current production (inherited liabilities).
(16) In accordance with Article 5 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, this aid covers costs which are expressly referred to in the Annex to the Decision, namely:
- FRF 631 million, FRF 731 million and FRF 837 million towards the cost of paying social-welfare benefits for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively resulting from the pensioning-off of workers before they reach statutory retirement age;
- FRF 154 million, FRF 244 million and FRF 157 million as other exceptional expenditure in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively on workers losing their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalisation;
- FRF 47 million, FRF 67 million and FRF 86 million towards residual costs for 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively resulting from administrative, legal or tax provisions;
- FRF 143 million, FRF 198 million and FRF 246 million towards additional work in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively resulting from restructuring;
- FRF 10 million, FRF 7 million and FRF 12 million towards mining damage in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively attributable to pits previously in service;
- FRF 73 million, FRF 45 million and FRF 45 million towards exceptional intrinsic depreciation in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively resulting from the restructuring of the industry;
- FRF 2811 million, FRF 2767 million and FRF 2752 million towards the increase in the contributions, outside the statutory system in 1997, 1998 and 1999 respectively to cover social security costs as a result of the drop, following restructuring, in the number of contributors.
(17) In accordance with Article 5(1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, this aid may be regarded as compatible with the common market if it does not exceed the costs arising from or having arisen from the modernisation, rationalisation or restructuring of the coal industry which are not related to current production. Having checked the data communicated, the Commission concludes that this requirement has been fulfilled. In the light of the above and on the basis of the information provided by France, the aid planned for 1997, 1998 and 1999 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.
IV
(18) In accordance with the second indent of Article 3(1) and Article 9(2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the Commission has to check that the aid authorised for current production is only for the purposes stipulated in Article 4 of the Decision. To this end, it must be informed of the amounts of such payments and the way they are broken down for 1999,","{'title': '2001/85/ECSC: Commission Decision of 20 September 2000 authorising France to grant aid to the coal industry for 1997, 1998 and 1999 (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2000) 2957)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrance is authorised to apply the following measures in favour of its coal industry for 1997:\n\n(a) aid for the reduction of activity, amounting to FRF 2454 million, intended to cover operating losses.

Whereas certain iron and steel products indispensable to the manufacture of certain goods and having very special physical and chemical characteristics are not produced in the Community, or produced in insufficient quantities; whereas for a number of  years insufficiency has been overcome by duty-free tariff quotas; whereas Community producers are still not in a position to comply with the present quality requirements put forward by the users; whereas duty-free quotas at a level securing the supply  of users is consequently required;
Whereas import of these products on preferential terms is not injurious to iron and steel undertakings in the Community which produce directly competing products;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/552/EEC of 3 October 1989 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities (1) and in particular Article 3a(2) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC,
Whereas:
(1) By letter of 28 April 1999, Germany notified to the Commission measures to be taken pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC.
(2) The Commission verified, within three months from this notification, that such measures are compatible with Community law, in particular as regards the proportionality of the measures and the transparency of the national consultation procedure.
(3) In its examination, the Commission took into consideration the available data on the German media landscape.
(4) The list of events of major importance for society included in the German measures was drawn up in a clear and transparent manner.
(5) The Commission was satisfied that the events listed in the German measures met at least two of the following criteria considered to be reliable indicators of the importance of events for society: (i) a special general resonance within the Member State, and not simply a significance to those who ordinarily follow the sport or activity concerned; (ii) a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the population in the Member State, in particular as a catalyst of cultural identity; (iii) involvement of the national team in the event concerned in the context of a competition or tournament of international importance; and (iv) the fact that the event has traditionally been broadcast on free television and has commanded large television audiences.
(6) A significant number of the events listed in the German measures, including the summer and winter Olympic games, all European Championship and World Cup football matches involving the German national team, as well as the opening match, the semi-finals and the finals of these tournaments, fall within the category of events traditionally considered to be of major importance for society, as referred to explicitly in recital 18 of Directive 97/36/EC. These events have a special general resonance in Germany, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events.
(7) The particular attention given, even in the non-specialised press, to the remaining events listed, including the semi-finals and final of the German FA Cup, the German national football team’s home and away matches, and the final of any European football club competition (Champions League, UEFA Cup) involving a German club, testifies to their special general resonance in Germany.
(8) The events listed have a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the German population, given their important contribution to understanding between peoples, as well as the importance of sport for the German society as a whole and for the national pride, as they provide the occasion for top German sportsmen to succeed in these most important international competitions.
(9) The German measures appear proportionate so as to justify a derogation from the fundamental EC Treaty freedom to provide services on the basis of an overriding reason of public interest, which is to ensure wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society.
(10) The German measures are compatible with EC competition rules in that the definition of qualified broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria that allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of listed events is not disproportionate so as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets.
(11) After communication by the Commission to the other Member States of the German measures and consultation of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC, the Director-General for Education and Culture informed Germany, by letter of 2 July 1999, that the European Commission did not intend to object to the measures notified.
(12) The German measures entered into force on 1 April 2000. These final measures differed from the measures notified in 1999 insofar as one event no longer appeared among the listed events, namely the ‘Cup Winner’s Cup’, which was because the tournament had been discontinued after being held for the last time in 1998/1999.
(13) Those measures were published in the C Series of the Official Journal of the European Communities
 (2) in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC.

These events have a special general resonance in Germany, as they are particularly popular with the general public, not just with those who usually follow sport events.\n\n((7)) The particular attention given, even in the non-specialised press, to the remaining events listed, including the semi-finals and final of the German FA Cup, the German national football team’s home and away matches, and the final of any European football club competition (Champions League, UEFA Cup) involving a German club, testifies to their special general resonance in Germany.\n\n((8)) The events listed have a generally recognised, distinct cultural importance for the German population, given their important contribution to understanding between peoples, as well as the importance of sport for the German society as a whole and for the national pride, as they provide the occasion for top German sportsmen to succeed in these most important international competitions.\n\n((9)) The German measures appear proportionate so as to justify a derogation from the fundamental EC Treaty freedom to provide services on the basis of an overriding reason of public interest, which is to ensure wide public access to broadcasts of events of major importance for society.\n\n((10)) The German measures are compatible with EC competition rules in that the definition of qualified broadcasters for the broadcasting of listed events is based on objective criteria that allow actual and potential competition for the acquisition of the rights to broadcast these events. In addition, the number of listed events is not disproportionate so as to distort competition on the downstream free television and pay television markets.\n\n((11)) After communication by the Commission to the other Member States of the German measures and consultation of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of Directive 89/552/EEC, the Director-General for Education and Culture informed Germany, by letter of 2 July 1999, that the European Commission did not intend to object to the measures notified.\n\n((12)) The German measures entered into force on 1 April 2000. These final measures differed from the measures notified in 1999 insofar as one event no longer appeared among the listed events, namely the ‘Cup Winner’s Cup’, which was because the tournament had been discontinued after being held for the last time in 1998/1999.\n\n((13)) Those measures were published in the C Series of theOfficial Journal of the European Communities(2)in accordance with Article 3a(2) of Directive 89/552/EEC.\n\n((14)) It follows from the judgment of the Court of First Instance in Case T-33/01, Infront WM v Commission, that the declaration that measures taken pursuant to Article 3a(1) of Directive 89/552/EEC are compatible with Community law constitutes a decision within the meaning of Article 249 of the EC Treaty, which must therefore be adopted by the Commission.

suspending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 215/2002 on imports of ferro molybdenum originating in the People’s Republic of China
(2006/714/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 14(4) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 215/2002 of 28 January 2002 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of ferro molybdenum originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), falling under CN code 7202 70 00 (the product concerned). The rate of the anti-dumping duty is 22,5 %.
(2) Information on a change of market conditions which occurred after the original investigation period (i.e. from 1 October 1999 to 30 September 2000), and which might justify the suspension of the measures currently in force, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, was provided to the Commission. Consequently, the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted.
B.   GROUNDS
(3) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that, in the Community interest, anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension, provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.
(4) Eurofer, on behalf of a number of users of the product concerned, has alleged that in the time since the investigation period, the market situation has changed. The complainants in the original investigation and other Community producers of the product concerned, represented by Euroalliages, commented on these allegations, and an adversarial exchange of views took place.
(5) Since the definitive imposition of the measures in February 2002, Chinese imports have decreased substantially. Eurostat statistics point to a drop from ca. 12 KT in 2001 to virtually no imports in the period 1 April 2005-31 March 2006. Euroalliages calculated a higher degree of penetration with imports reaching over 1 KT based on the allegation that certain imports declared as having a Dutch origin were in reality Chinese. In any event, even under this assumption, the very significant drop in import penetration is clear.
(6) Regarding imports from other third countries, these have increased from ca. 2,7 KT to 10,7 KT, thus compensating partially the drop in Chinese imports. Consumption has increased by 14 %.
(7) Market prices in the Community have increased from ca. EUR 8/kg in the original IP to ca. EUR 80/kg in 2005 and are in the range of ca. EUR 60/kg in 2006. These trends can also be found in other major markets across the world.
(8) Out of the factors claimed by the parties the main explanation for this price increase seems to be a shortage in roasting capacities, i.e., the capacities to transform molybdenum concentrate into molybdenum oxide (which is then converted into ferro molybdenum). This driving factor explains to a large extent the price increases and the demand-supply imbalance that this has generated in the Community market. On the basis of the information presented, it appears that the roasting capacity shortfall will disappear in all likelihood in the course of 2007 as a result of new roasting capacity coming on stream.
(9) With regard to the Community industry, it is to be noted that since the imposition of the measures, the situation of the Community industry has improved. The sales and production volumes have increased by 25 % and 5 % respectively, reaching a market share of ca. 26 %. The profit situation also improved. Although the Community industry has not consistently achieved the normal 5 % profit level established by the original investigation, the Community industry has, however, gained up to 5 percentage points and become profitable.
(10) Chinese export prices to third countries have followed the same upward trend described above indicating that should measures be suspended it is unlikely that they would decrease in the very short term to such an extent that injury would resume.
(11) No indications have been found as to why the suspension would not be in the Community interest.
C.   CONCLUSION
(12) In conclusion, given the temporary change in market conditions, and in particular the high level of prices of the product concerned practised on the Community market, which is far above the injurious level found in the original investigation, together with the alleged demand-supply imbalance of the product concerned, it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the PRC is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension. It is therefore proposed to suspend for nine months the measures in force in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation.
(13) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in force. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment. The Community industry did not oppose the suspension of the anti-dumping measures in force.
(14) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 21 June 2013
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Malta
(2013/319/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(6) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Malta,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 TFEU, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of the said Protocol.
(4) According to Article 126(5) TFEU, if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur, it is to address an opinion to the Member State concerned and inform the Council accordingly. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 126(3) TFEU and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 126(4) TFEU, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in Malta. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to Malta and informed the Council thereof on 29 May 2013 (3).
(5) Article 126(6) TFEU states that the Council is to consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Malta, this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions.
(6) According to data notified by the Maltese authorities in April 2013, the general government deficit in Malta reached 3,3 % of GDP in 2012, thus exceeding the 3 %-of-GDP reference value. The Commission report under Article 126(3) TFEU considers that the deficit was close to the 3 %-of-GDP reference value, but the excess over the reference value could not be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the TFEU and the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it does not result from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In 2010 and 2011, real GDP growth was, on average, above 2 % annually, higher than potential growth. Preliminary GDP data published by the national statistics office on 11 March 2013 show that economic growth slowed down in 2012, but remained positive at 0,8 %. The positive output gap in 2011 is estimated to have turned slightly negative in 2012. The planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission services 2013 spring forecast, the deficit would increase to 3,7 % of GDP in 2013 and reach 3,6 % of GDP in 2014. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(7) Notified data also show that the general government gross debt stood at 72,1 % of GDP in 2012, above the 60 %-of-GDP reference value. The Commission services 2013 spring forecast projects the debt ratio to increase to 74,9 % of GDP in 2014. Following the abrogation of the EDP in December 2012 (4), Malta benefitted from a three-year transition period to comply with the debt reduction benchmark, starting in 2012. In 2012, Malta did not make sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt reduction benchmark, as its structural deficit worsened whereas it was required to improve it. It can therefore be concluded that the debt criterion of the TFEU is not fulfilled.
(8) In line with the provisions in the TFEU and in the Stability and Growth Pact, the Commission also analysed in its report relevant factors. As specified in the Stability and Growth Pact, for countries with a debt ratio above 60 % of GDP (such as Malta), these factors can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the decision on the existence of an excessive deficit, when assessing compliance on the basis of the deficit criterion, if the general government deficit remains close to the reference value and its excess over the reference value is temporary, which is not the case for Malta (5). At the same time, such factors have been taken into account when assessing the breach of the debt criterion, but they do not seem to question the decision on the existence of an excessive deficit either. In particular, progress towards compliance with the debt reduction benchmark has been assessed in light of the debt- and deficit-increasing impact of financial assistance to euro area Member States. For Malta, the cumulative impact of the Greek loan facility, European Financial Stability Facility disbursements, capital contributions to the European Stability Mechanism, and operations under the Greek programme over the period 2011-2014 would be 3,9 % of GDP on debt, and 0,1 % of GDP on deficit. When taking into account the impact of these operations, the structural effort for 2012 required for Malta to comply with the debt criterion would have been lower, but still well above the structural effort actually implemented by Malta in 2012,","{'header': '26.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 173/52', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 21 June 2013\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Malta\n(2013/319/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 TFEU, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

Having regard to the opinions of the European Medicines Agency formulated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use,
Whereas:
(1) All pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals should be evaluated in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.

Toltrazuril is also included in Annex III to that Regulation for bovine species for muscle, fat, liver and kidney, excluding animals from which milk is produced for human consumption, awaiting completion of scientific studies. Those studies have now been completed and toltrazuril should therefore be extended in Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 to include bovines.

Whereas, in view of the experience gained, and account being taken of the current state of the art, it is now possible to make certain requirements of Directive 71/127/EEC more stringent in order to improve road safety;
Whereas the current requirements in respect of category N2 vehicles having a mass of more than 7,5 tonnes and category N3 vehicles other than tractive units for semi-trailers have proved to be inadequate in respect of the outside field of vision to the side and to the rear of the vehicle; whereas, in order to deal with this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide for the fitting of an additional rear-view mirror of the so-called 'wide-angle' type;
Whereas the current requirements in respect of category N2 vehicles having a mass of more than 7,5 tonnes have proved to be inadequate too with regard to the field of vision in the zone adjacent to the side of the cab structure opposite the driver; whereas, in order to deal with this shortcoming, it is necessary to provide for the fitting of a rear-view mirror of the 'close-proximity' type;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1),
Whereas:
I
By letter of 10 September 1991 the Portuguese Government informed the Commission, in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, of the financial measure it intends to take to support the coal industry in 1991.
Aid to cover operating losses in 1991 of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro totalling Esc 803 777 000 for the production of about 0,221 million tonnes has been submitted by the Portuguese Government for approval by the Commission.
II
The decrease in aid compared with 1990 must be viewed in the light of the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, in particular those of Article 2 (1) thereof, and of the implementation of the business strategy of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro,  submitted to the Commission by the Portuguese Government by letter of 16 April 1991.
The aim of the abovementioned business strategy is progressively to reduce the production and workforce of the undertaking Carbonifera do Douro between 1990 and 1994, when total closure of the undertaking is planned.
The trend recorded in 1991 is consistent with the aim of the business strategy. Although the cost of each tonne produced increased owing to the substantial impact of labour costs on the total costs, the combined effect of the reduction in output and the  increase in coal prices resulted in a reduction in the overall amount of aid for 1991 as compared to 1990.
The aid proposed will cover the difference between the projected average costs and the projected average revenue for each tonne produced. The aid will not exceed expected operating losses and hence complies with the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1)  of the Decision.
The gradual closure that this measure allows will facilitate the execution of regional development programmes and hence contribute to solving the social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry, in accordance with the third  indent of Article 2 (1).
In view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities, the aid to be granted to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry in 1991 is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market.
III
Pursuant to Article 11 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the direct aid to current production which it authorizes is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 3 and 6 thereof. It must therefore be informed of  the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '92/54/ECSC: Commission Decision of 11 December 1991 approving the grant of aid by Portugal to the coal industry in 1991 (Only the Portuguese text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPortugal is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Esc 803 777 000 to the coal industry to cover operating losses for the 1991 calendar year.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Portuguese Government shall inform the Commission at the latest by 30 June 1992 of the actual amount of aid paid in 1991.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic.

Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney, whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;

Certain establishments which are authorised to process non-compliant milk are listed in Chapter I, and certain establishments which are authorised to process both compliant and non-compliant milk, provided that such processing is carried out on separate production lines are listed in Chapter II, of the Appendix to Annex VI to that Act.\n\n((2)) A number of the establishments currently listed in Chapter I of that Appendix have ceased the activities covered by the transitional periods. Those establishments should therefore be deleted from that list.\n\n((3)) In view of the evolution of the quality of the raw milk and the present proportion of production of raw milk in Bulgaria that does not comply with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004, certain establishments should be included in the list set out in Chapter I of that Appendix to Annex VI of the Act of Accession.\n\n((4)) Furthermore, certain milk processing establishments in Bulgaria have the capacity and equipment to process compliant and non-compliant milk on separate production lines. Those establishments should be included on the list set out in Chapter II of that Appendix.\n\n((5)) Therefore, the Appendix to Annex VI to the Act of Accession should be amended.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2001(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1563/2001(6), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. Whereas it is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. Whereas the fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Now that a settlement has been reached between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States and has been approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(7), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(8), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1786/2001(9), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark stipulates that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex to this Regulation. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns authorisation of the fermentation product of Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 458 (Amaferm), as a feed additive for dairy cows, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 8 March 2006 that the fermentation product of Aspergillus oryzae NRRL 458 (Amaferm) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (2). It further concluded that that fermentation product does not present any other risk which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. Amaferm has shown to produce positive effects on milk yield of dairy cows. The opinion of the Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. It does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000(1) laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue and in particular Article 8(2)(d) and (3), Article 9(1)(c) and Article 12, first paragraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In the light of the evolution of the bluetongue situation in four Member States in 2001, Commission Decision 2001/783/EC of 9 November 2001 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and on rules applicable to movements of animals in and from those zones(2), as last amended by Decision 2003/14/EC(3), was adopted, establishing three geographical zones corresponding to specific epidemiological situations. This Decision also provides for the conditions under which exemptions to the restrictions applicable to animal movements laid down by the Directive can be implemented.
(2) As regards Greece, the surveillance programme carried on by Greek authorities has demonstrated no seroconversion on sentinel animals during the year 2002.
(3) Therefore provisions can be made to relax, under certain conditions, the restrictions on movements of live animals of susceptible species from the Greek territory, with the exception of areas which are under threat of direct reinfestation from third countries.
(4) As regards Italy and France, the surveillance programmes carried out in Italy and France have demonstrated that in areas where the vaccination has been correctly implemented, virus circulation has been reduced to a negligible level before the winter season.
(5) Therefore provisions can be made to relax, under certain conditions, restrictions on movements of vaccinated live animals from those areas.
(6) However, the main condition for implementing these relaxation measures should be that the surveillance programme in place does not show that bluetongue virus activity has recommenced in that area, and it is further appropriate to distinguish areas of higher and lower epidemiological risks respectively.
(7) Technical amendments should also be introduced to facilitate movements of live animals inside the territory of the same Member State, in particular for immediate slaughter.
(8) For the sake of clarity it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2001/783/EC and to replace it by the present Decision.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, first Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Having regard to the application for negative clearance or, failing that, exemption submitted on 29 August 1988 by Société Minière et Métallurgique de Peñarroya SA, France, and Preussag Aktiengesellschaft, Germany, concerning a transaction decided by the two companies with a view to merging their 'non-ferrous metals' activities,
Having regard to the summary of the notification (2) published pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
Having consulted the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
I. THE FACTS
A. The undertakings
The undertakings concerned are:
(a) Société Minière et Métallurgique de Peñarroya SA, (hereinafter referred to as 'Peñarroya', a French company operating principally in France and Spain. Its worldwide turnover in 1987 was about ECU 567 million, of which ECU 545 million in the common market.
(b) Preussag Aktiengesellschaft (hereinafter referred to as 'Preussag'), a German company having European and worldwide operations. Its worldwide turnover in 1987 was ECU 5 100 million, of which ECU 4 500 million in the common market.
B. The subject of the transaction
(1) On 22 April 1988, Preussag and Peñarroya, decided on the one hand to merge of their 'non-ferrous metals' activities with a view to strengthening the industrial position of their undertakings, and on the other to create a new entity, known as Metaleurop SA.
(a) Merger of the metals activities
(2) Preussag AG first set up a holding company, Metaleurop GmbH, for all its metals subsidiaries, such as the electrolytic zinc smelter, lead smelter, secondary lead processing and activities in the galvanizing and special metals sectors.
(3) On 27 June 1988, Peñarroya proceeded with a first capital increase of FF 441 million by the issue of 6 300 000 shares fully subscribed by Preussag. The funds received enabled Peñarroya to acquire shares in the abovementioned holding company, Metaleurop GmbH.
(b) The new entity Metaleurop SA
(4) The other principal shareholder in the new entity is the French holding company Imetal.
Imetal had for a long time had a large holding in Peñarroya which it reduced at the end of March 1988 to 15,9 % through a public purchase offer. A second increase of FF 170 million in Peñarroya's capital was presented to the ordinary and extraordinary general meetings held on 7 November 1988. The purpose was to bring Imetal's holding up to approximately 20 % of Peñarroya by the issue of subscription rights and the capitalization of sums owed by Peñarroya to Imetal.
As a result of these operations, the main shareholders in Peñarroya, now known as Metaleurop SA, are Preussag and Imetal with 45 % and 20 % respectively of the capital. The remaining 35 % is held by the public.
(5) The commercial side of Metaleurop's operations is separate from the parent companies, as are its management bodies.
It has a Supervisory Board composed of nine members, i. e. two members from Preussag, two from Imetal and five independent members, and a Board of Directors with two members from Preussag and two from Imetal/Peñarroya.
B. The markets affected by the transaction
(6) The merger between Preussag and Peñarroya concerns the zinc and lead markets, both being economic sectors with particular features.
(a) The zinc and lead markets
(7) Zinc production in 1987 in the Community was 1 966 000 tonnes, whereas consumption totalled only 1 720 000 tonnes. In spite of the over-production large quantities were imported into the Community and exports were high.
As regards lead, production and consumption in the Community were roughly in balance, each totalling some 1 600 000 tonnes. Despite this, imports were high.
(8) Preussag and Peñarroya each held important positions on the two markets in question.
(9) In the zinc market, Preussag and Peñarroya held approximately 11 % and 12 % respectively of the market.
Preussag, however, closed down most of its recycled zinc processing plant at Harlingerode, keeping two furnaces in operation for one year for tests, thus reducing its market share to about 8 %.
Metaleurop holds 20 % of the market. It competes with other European producers on the Community market, e. g. Union Minière (approximately 25 %), Budelco (about 11 %), Asturiana del Zinc (about 11 %), Nuova Samin (about 7 %), AMS (about 6 %), and also with producers outside the Community.
(10) As regards lead, Preussag and Peñarroya held approximately 11 % and 18 % respectively of the market.
As a result of the merger, the new company Metaleurop SA has become the leading manufacturer in Europe, and holds some 29 % of the market, although here too it competes with other Community manufacturers such as Britannia Refined Metals (about 10 %), Nuova Samin (about 9 %), Metallgesellschaft (about 7 %) and some 20 smaller secondary lead producers (about 8 %) and producers outside the Community.
Thus, although Metaleurop holds a large share of the market, there will be sufficient competition in the market for lead owing to the presence of a large number of other producers and the fact that consumers are able to obtain supplies outside the Community because of the low rate of customs duties on this product.
(b) Price formation
(11) Lead and zinc prices are formed on the basis of the prices quoted by the London Metal Exchange (LME), which operates as an exchange and also has warehouses where products can be delivered or collected.
(12) On the lead market, selling prices are based exclusively on prices quoted by the LME. LME prices also appear to have a definited influence on zinc prices. In its Decision 84/405/EEC (1), the Commission had prohibited both the joint fixing of a 'zinc producer price' applied from July 1964 to October 1977 and joint action by the six European producers to influence the price of zinc on the London Metal Exchange.
The Decision noted, however, that in 1977 the producer price which, according to the undertakings, had been introduced to prevent violent fluctuations and speculative increases in the LME prices, was no longer being applied in Europe.
The Metal Bulletin had also regularly published, up to December 1988, a 'European Producer Price' based on selling price quotations obtained from various smelters and mines supplying zinc or zinc concentrates processed in Europe.
The Bulletin has, however, ceased publishing this information (2).
(13) No comments were received by the Commission following publication of its notice pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Council Regulation No 17 inviting interested parties to submit their observations concerning the operation in question.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
Article 86
(14) Article 86 prohibits as incompatible with the common market any abuse by an undertaking of a dominant position within the common market or a substantial part thereof in so far as it may affect trade between Member States.
(15) Preussag had acquired a holding in Peñarroya by subscribing only to an increase in the capital of that company. The transaction was achieved by transferring to Peñarroya al Preussag's metals activities previously grouped together in a holding company.
Following a second capital increase reserved for Imetal, which is the other major shareholder in Peñarroya, the latter changed its name to Metaleurop SA.
(16) Metaleurop has thus taken the place of Peñarroya and comprises all the metals activities formerly owned by Preussag and Peñarroya.
(17) Prior to the concentration of their metals activities, the undertakings in question held relatively large shares of both the Community zinc and lead markets. Peñarroya's market share in zinc was approximately 12 % and Preussag's in the region of 8 %.
In the market for lead, Peñarroya held approximately 18 %, whilst Preussag's was approximately 11 %.
As a result, neither party held a dominant position in the market for the products forming the subject of the merger in question, thus excluding the application of the case law of the Court of Justice in Continental Can (1) in this case.
(18) Despite the size of the merger between Peñarroya and Preussag which gives the new economic entity, Metaleurop, approximately 20 % of the zinc market and some 30 % of the lead market, it seems unlikely to prevent the maintenance of effective competition on the Community market, chiefly because of the presence of other major producers and the continued flow of a large number of imports into the Community from non-member countries.
Similarly, the characteristics of price formation in the lead and zinc sectors and the essentially speculative nature of transactions within the LME make it highly unlikely that Metaleurop will have a decisive influence on the formation of prices.
(19) There are therefore no grounds for concern that the operation in question will have the effect of impeding effective competition contrary to the provisions of Article 86. Consequently, a negative clearance may be issued in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation No 17,","{'title': '90/363/EEC: Commission Decision of 26 June 1990 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 86 of the EEC-Treaty (IV/32.846 - Metaleurop SA) (Only the German and French texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '86', 'title': 'Article 86', 'text': ""Article 86\n\n(14) Article 86 prohibits as incompatible with the common market any abuse by an undertaking of a dominant position within the common market or a substantial part thereof in so far as it may affect trade between Member States.\n\n(15) Preussag had acquired a holding in Peñarroya by subscribing only to an increase in the capital of that company.

(1) Under Article 377 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (2), Portugal may continue to exempt the transactions listed in points (2), (4), (7), (9), (10) and (13) of Annex X, Part B, in accordance with the conditions applying in that Member State on 1 January 1989; these transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT resources base.
(2) Portugal has requested authorisation from the Commission to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base since it is unable to make the precise calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point (10) of Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC.

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the level which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and all substances belonging to the sulfonamide group should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies in progress, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for trimethoprim;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorizations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1513/2001(2), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 34(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 of 16 December 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards intervention on the market in butter and cream (2), stipulates that the amount of aid for private storage referred to in Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 is to be fixed each year.
(2) The third subparagraph of Article 6(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 specifies that the aid shall be fixed in the light of storage costs and the likely trend in prices for fresh butter and butter from stocks.
(3) Regarding storage costs, notably the costs for entry and exit of the products concerned, the daily costs for cold storage and the financial costs of storage should be taken into account.
(4) Regarding the likely trend in prices, consideration should be given to the reductions of the butter intervention prices envisaged in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 and the resulting decreases expected for market prices for fresh butter and butter from stocks and higher aid should be awarded for applications for contracts received before 1 July 2006.
(5) To avoid excessive applications for private storage before that date, an indicative quantity and a communication mechanism, enabling the Commission to establish when this quantity is reached, need to be introduced for the period ending on 1 July 2006. This indicative quantity should be fixed taking into consideration the quantities covered by storage contracts in past years.
(6) Article 29(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2771/1999 stipulates that the entry into storage must take place between 15 March and 15 August. The current situation on the butter market justifies bringing the entry date for butter and cream storage operations in 2006 forward to 1 March.

Whereas the Community currently depends on imports from third countries for its supplies of boysenberries; whereas it is in the Community's interest to partially suspend the Common Customs Tariff duty for the product in question, within a Community tariff quota of an appropriate volume; whereas in order not to interfere with the prospects for developing fruit production in the Community and at the same time ensure an adequate supply to satisfy user industries, it is advisable to limit the benefit of the tariff quota to a quantitiy of 1 500 tonnes, to open the quota for the period 1 January to 31 December 1987 and to fix the quota duty at 15 %;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to allow all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the quota and to ensure uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, in the present case, it seems advisable not to allocate this quota among the Member States but to allow them to draw against the quota volume such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to the procedure specified in Article 1 (2); whereas this method of management requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must, in particular, be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is being used up and inform the Member States thereof;

Whereas an identification document accompanying registered equidae must permit the origin of the animals to be traced and must contain all details of the pedigrees of equidae;
Whereas on 26 June 1990 the Council adopted Directive 90/426/EEC on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae (2), as last amended by Directive 92/36/EEC (3), whereas, in accordance with that Directive,  special health certificates have been drawn up for imports of registered horses; whereas such certificates refer to the identification document (passport);

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of 26 June 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012, and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 383(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The application of the advanced method to the determination of own funds requirements for Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) risk may involve counterparties for which no Credit Default Swap (CDS) spread is available. Where this is the case, institutions should use a spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty (proxy spread) in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 383(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.
(2) Rules on the determination of proxy spread for CVA risk should provide for the use of broad categories of rating, industry and region, and they should allow institutions the necessary flexibility to determine the most appropriate proxy spread based on their expert judgment.
(3) When specifying in more detail how the attributes of rating, industry and region of the single issuers should be considered by institutions when estimating an appropriate proxy spread for the determination of the own funds requirements, as required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, rules should be established for the consideration of those attributes by reference to minimum categories for each attribute, in order to ensure a harmonised application of those conditions.
(4) Furthermore, in the case of single issuers, where a link, such as between a regional government or local authority and the sovereign, exists, it should be possible to allow for the estimation of an appropriate proxy spread on the basis of the credit spread of a single issuer, where this leads to a more appropriate estimation.
(5) In order to lead to an appropriate computation of the CVA risk charge, a proxy spread should be determined using data that has been observed in a liquid market, and assumptions regarding data, such as interpolation and extrapolation of data relating to different tenors, should be conceptually sound.
(6) In order to ensure convergence of practices among institutions and to avoid inconsistencies, considering that implied probabilities of default (PDs), Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads and loss given default (LGD) constitute one equation with two unknown variables and that the market convention is to use a fixed value for LGD in order to derive implied PDs from market spreads, institutions should use a value for LGDMKT that is consistent with the fixed LGD commonly used by market participants for determining implied PDs from those liquid traded credit spreads that have been used to determine the proxy credit spread for the counterparty in question.
(7) For the purposes of permission to use the advanced CVA method for a limited number of smaller portfolios, it is appropriate to consider a portfolio as a netting set as defined in Article 272(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the number of non-internal model method (‘IMM’) transactions subject to the CVA risk charge and the size of non-IMM netting sets subject to the CVA risk charge, and to limit them in terms of a percentage of the total number of all transactions subject to the CVA risk charge and a percentage of the total size of all netting sets subject to the calculation of CVA risk charge, in order to take account of the different dimensions of institutions.
(8) In order to mitigate possible discontinuities in the use of the advanced CVA method for a limited number of smaller portfolios, the use of the advanced CVA method should cease only when quantitative limits are breached for two consecutive quarters.
(9) Further, in order to render it possible for competent authorities to perform their supervisory duties in an efficient manner, they should be able to know when the requirement of a limited number of smaller portfolios is no longer met; hence institutions should notify competent authorities in those cases.

Where this is the case, institutions should use a spread that is appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty (proxy spread) in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 383(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013.\n\n((2)) Rules on the determination of proxy spread for CVA risk should provide for the use of broad categories of rating, industry and region, and they should allow institutions the necessary flexibility to determine the most appropriate proxy spread based on their expert judgment.\n\n((3)) When specifying in more detail how the attributes of rating, industry and region of the single issuers should be considered by institutions when estimating an appropriate proxy spread for the determination of the own funds requirements, as required by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, rules should be established for the consideration of those attributes by reference to minimum categories for each attribute, in order to ensure a harmonised application of those conditions.\n\n((4)) Furthermore, in the case of single issuers, where a link, such as between a regional government or local authority and the sovereign, exists, it should be possible to allow for the estimation of an appropriate proxy spread on the basis of the credit spread of a single issuer, where this leads to a more appropriate estimation.\n\n((5)) In order to lead to an appropriate computation of the CVA risk charge, a proxy spread should be determined using data that has been observed in a liquid market, and assumptions regarding data, such as interpolation and extrapolation of data relating to different tenors, should be conceptually sound.\n\n((6)) In order to ensure convergence of practices among institutions and to avoid inconsistencies, considering that implied probabilities of default (PDs), Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads and loss given default (LGD) constitute one equation with two unknown variables and that the market convention is to use a fixed value for LGD in order to derive implied PDs from market spreads, institutions should use a value for LGDMKTthat is consistent with the fixed LGD commonly used by market participants for determining implied PDs from those liquid traded credit spreads that have been used to determine the proxy credit spread for the counterparty in question.\n\n((7)) For the purposes of permission to use the advanced CVA method for a limited number of smaller portfolios, it is appropriate to consider a portfolio as a netting set as defined in Article 272(4) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 the number of non-internal model method (‘IMM’) transactions subject to the CVA risk charge and the size of non-IMM netting sets subject to the CVA risk charge, and to limit them in terms of a percentage of the total number of all transactions subject to the CVA risk charge and a percentage of the total size of all netting sets subject to the calculation of CVA risk charge, in order to take account of the different dimensions of institutions.\n\n((8)) In order to mitigate possible discontinuities in the use of the advanced CVA method for a limited number of smaller portfolios, the use of the advanced CVA method should cease only when quantitative limits are breached for two consecutive quarters.\n\n((9)) Further, in order to render it possible for competent authorities to perform their supervisory duties in an efficient manner, they should be able to know when the requirement of a limited number of smaller portfolios is no longer met; hence institutions should notify competent authorities in those cases.\n\n((10)) This Regulation is based on the draft regulatory technical standards submitted by the European Banking Authority to the Commission.\n\n((11)) The European Banking Authority has conducted open public consultations on the draft regulatory technical standards on which this Regulation is based, analysed the potential related costs and benefits and requested the opinion of the Banking Stakeholder Group established in accordance with Article 37 of Regulation (EU) No\xa01093/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(1),', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Determining an appropriate proxy spread', 'text': 'Article 1\nDetermining an appropriate proxy spread\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The proxy spread for a given counterparty shall be deemed appropriate having regard to the rating, industry and region of the counterparty according to the fourth subparagraph of Article 383(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013, where the following conditions are satisfied:\n(a)\nthe proxy spread has been determined by considering all of the attributes of rating, industry and region of the counterparty as specified in points (b), (c) and (d);\n(b)\nthe attribute of rating has been determined by considering the use of a predetermined hierarchy of sources of internal and external ratings.

Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the  minimum price to be paid to products and the difference between the cost of the raw material in the Community and in the major competing third countries;

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1104/2003(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2221/2003 of 18 December 2003 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and in Article 1(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 19 December 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 December 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 158, 27.6.2003, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(4) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(5) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 55.\n\n(6) OJ L 312, 23.12.1995, p. 25.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 18 December 2003 fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1), as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1779/2002 (OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are as follows:\n\nC10 All destinations except for Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n\nC11 All destinations except for Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n\nC12 All destinations except for Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia.\n\nC13 All destinations except for Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 129d  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission  (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee  (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions  (3),
Acting in accordance with procedure laid down in Article 189b of the Treaty  (4),
Whereas the aim of establishing trans-European telecommunication networks is to allow the  circulation of information with a view to enabling the internal market to function properly for all  participants, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises in the Community, and strengthening  its economic and social cohesion;
Whereas the internal market establishes an area without internal frontiers within which the free  movement of goods, services and capital must be guaranteed; whereas in order to ensure each of  these freedoms, the Community acts adopted or being adopted provide for measures involving a  substantial interchange of data between individuals, economic operators and the competent  administrations; whereas such interchange can be ensured using trans-European networks;
Whereas action by the Community in this field has to take account in particular of the need to link  island, land-locked and peripheral regions with the central regions of the Community;
Whereas Council Recommendation 86/659/EEC  (5) provides for a set of ISDN services compatible at  European level to be made available, which is also the subject of a Memorandum of Understanding  between the public telecommunications network operators;
Whereas the Council Resolution of 18 July 1989  (6) called for a strengthening of coordination on  the introduction of ISDN in the European Community before the end of 1992;
Whereas Council Recommendation 92/383/EEC  (7) calls for the application to ISDN of the principles  of open network provision;
Whereas, in this Resolution of 5 June 1992  (8), the Council recognized the importance of  developing ISDN in the context of trans-European networks;
Considering the conclusions of the European Council meeting in Corfu on 24 and 25 June 1994 and in  particular those relating to the information society;
Whereas for the further development of the regulatory framework, account should be taken of the  objectives defined in this Decision;
Whereas it is important, for the smooth operation of the internal market, to facilitate the  movement of goods, services, persons and capital between the Community and third countries, and  more specially the member countries of the European Free Trade Association; whereas such movements  will strengthen trade relations between the economic operators of the countries concerned; whereas  cooperation must therefore be established with those countries in order to promote Europe-wide  interconnection and interoperability of ISDN;
Whereas adequate Community action is needed to establish smooth coordination between the Member  States and the economic operators responsible for creating the basic infrastructure, in order to  ensure the harmonized introduction of ISDN services; whereas failure to adopt a Decision of the  European Parliament and of the Council on the development of ISDN as a trans-European network would  be liable to result in a lack of interconnection and interoperability between national networks and  a smaller supply of compatible basic services,","{'title': '95/489/EC: Decision No 2717/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 November 1995 on a set of guidelines for the development of the EURO-ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) as a trans- European network', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Decision establishes the guidelines identifying the objectives,  priorities, broad categories of measures and a number of projects of common interest concerning the  development of EURO-ISDN as a trans-European network.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nfor the purposes of this Decision:\n\n-  'Euro-ISDN` shall mean a set if ISDN facilities and services implemented on the basis of the  harmonized European standards as set out in Annex I, point 1,\n\n-  'basic services ` shall mean the services set out in Annex I, point 2,\n\n-  'telematic services` shall mean the services set out in Annex I, point 3.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': ""Article 3\n\nThe objectives as regards the development of the ISDN as a trans-European network and  into an element of the infrastructure for the 'universal service` shall be as follows:\n\n-  the development of a range of services based on the EURO-ISDN, with account also being taken of  the future introduction of a European broadband communications network,\n\n-  availability of a full geographical coverage by EURO-ISDN in all Member States having regard to  market needs, in particular to facilitate access of the island, land-locked and peripheral regions  by means of EURO-ISDN.""}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe priorities for achieving the objectives referred to in Article 3 shall be as  follows:\n\n-  to promote the use of EURO-ISDN, in particular by small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as  public organizations,\n\n-  to contribute to the rapid availability of affordable testing equipment,\n\n-  to promote access to less expensive terminal equipment and application software.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\nThe broad categories of measures necessary to attain the objectives referred to in  Article 3 and to comply with the priorities laid down in Article 4 shall be as follows:\n\n-  analysis of obstacles to the deployment of EURO-ISDN and the means to be used to overcome them,\n\n-  promotion of end-to-end interoperability of telematic services,\n\n-  analysis and promotion of migration of public and private sector applications to EURO-ISDN,\n\n-  promotion of the availability of EURO-ISDN terminals and application software.'}, {'id': '6', 'title': 'Article 6', 'text': 'Article 6\n\nThe development of EURO-ISDN as a trans-European network shall be carried out pursuant  to this Decision in the form of projects of common interest.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns authorisation of a new use of the preparation Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) (Biosaf SC 47) as a feed additive for dairy goats and dairy sheep to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed. The method of analysis referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is therefore not to be understood as a Community method of analysis within the meaning of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(5) The use of the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) was authorised for cattle for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 316/2003 of 19 February 2003 concerning the permanent authorisation of an additive in feedingstuffs and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs (3), for piglets (weaned) by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2148/2004 of 16 December 2004 concerning the permanent and provisional authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs and the authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs (4), for sows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1288/2004 of 20 December 2004 concerning the permanent authorisation of certain additives and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs (5), for rabbits for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 600/2005 of 18 April 2005 concerning a new authorisation for 10 years of a coccidiostat as an additive in feedingstuffs, the provisional authorisation of an additive and the permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs (6), for dairy cows by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1811/2005 of 4 November 2005 concerning the provisional and permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs and the provisional authorisation of a new use of an additive already authorised in feedingstuffs (7) and for lambs for fattening by Commission Regulation No 1447/2006 of 29 September 2006 concerning the authorisation of a new use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Biosaf SC 47) as a feed additive (8).
(6) New data were submitted in support of the application for authorisation for dairy goats and dairy sheep. The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 12 July 2006 that the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment (9). It further concluded that the preparation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NCYC Sc 47) does not present any other risk for this additional animal category which would, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, exclude authorisation. According to that opinion, the use of that preparation can improve significantly milk yield in dairy goats and dairy sheep. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post market monitoring. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.

31990R0737,"Council Regulation (EEC) No 737/90 of 22 March 1990 on the conditions governing imports of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power-station
","COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 737/90
of 22 March 1990
on the conditions governing impots of agricultural products originating in third countries following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power-station
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power-station on 26 April 1986, considerable quantities of radioactive elements were released into the atmosphere;
Whereas 3955/87 (1), as amended by 4003/89 (2), fixed maximum permitted levels of radioactivity for agricultural products originating in third countries and intended for human consumption with which imports of the products concerned must comply and in connection with which checks are carried out by the Member States; whereas that Regulation applies only until 31 March 1990;
Whereas, without prejudice to the possibility of resorting, where necessary, in the future to the provisions of Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3954/87 of 22 December 1987 laying down maximum permitted radioactivity levels for foodstuffs and feedingstuffs following a nuclear accident or any other case of radiological emergency (3), as amended by Regulation (Euratom) No 2218/89 (4), the Community must continue to ensure, with regard to the specific effects of the accident at Chernobyl, that agricultural products and processed agricultural products intended for human consumption and likely to be contaminated are introduced into the Community only according to common arrangements;
Whereas these common arrangements should safeguard the health of consumers, maintain, without having unduly adverse effects on trade between the Community and third countries, the unified nature of the market and prevent deflections of trade;
Whereas the reasons prevailing when Regulation (EEC) No 3955/87 was adopted are still valid, particularly on account of the fact that radioactive contamination in certain agricultural products originating in the third countries affected by the accident still exceed the maximum permitted levels of radioactivity laid down in that Regulation;
Whereas compliance with the maximum permitted levels must be the subject of appropriate checks, which may lead to prohibiting imports in cases of non-compliance;

Whereas, by letter dated 17 November 1980, Belgium has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as ""JEOL-electron microscope, model JEM-200CX"", to be used for microstructural research of the transformation and deformation of metallic materials and in particular for the determination of the cell structure after deformation, onset of metal fatigue, phase-boundary displacements, intense shear bands, stress-relieved structure of steel and adhesion of dispersoids after deformation, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community ;
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79, a group of experts composed of representatives of all the Member States met on 28 April 1981 within the framework of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements to examine the matter ;

A second priority will be given to actions aimed at improving fish-handling facilities, particularly at the major fishing ports. The third priority will be given to investment in marketing, market research in order to improve the market position of fish products in home and export markets.\n\n6.

The Commission considers that the programme submitted by Ireland as a framework for future Community or national financing schemes, constitutes a suitable basis to facilitate the development of the processing and marketing of fish products.\n\nIn this connection, the Commission emphasizes the importance of the future development of resources and of the consequences and objectives of the multiannual guidance programmes with regard to the fishing fleet and to aquaculture for the future development of the processing and marketing of fish and fish products.\n\n2. Given that the structural measures for restructuring the fishing fleet and aquaculture will expire at the end of 1986, the Commission reserves the possibility of reviewing the current programme at a later date in order that the structural measures relating to the fishing fleet and aquaculture, foreseen for 1987 and later, may be taken into consideration in an appropriate manner in relation to the sector for processing and marketing of fish and fish products.\n\n3. Given the resource situation and the fact that the Irish fishing fleet has to be kept at its 1984 level in order to adapt it to these resources, the Commission considers that the priority aspects of the programme are of a qualitative nature, particularly in relation to demersal species.\n\nThe emphasis on increased investment in secondary processing of all species should be approached in a prudent manner, given the continued uncertainty in supplies, and competition from wholesalers for these supplies.\n\nThe Commission accepts the need to improve the marketing effort in Ireland in order to improve the value added, particularly in export markets. However, in any market campaign in the home market, care should be exercised to avoid any discrimination against products from other Community Member States, or any secondary detrimental effect on these products' marketability.\n\nThe Commission recommends that the Irish authorities undertake an analysis of the processing sector's financial performance in order to identify more clearly those enterprises or products which should benefit from priority financing.\n\n4. Furthermore, investments in products for human consumption which are not listed in Annex II of the EEC Treaty shall be examined with particular reference to Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 355/77; these should contain significant amounts of fish.\n\n5. Taking into account the present situation in the Community market for sardines tinned in traditional form, the Commission affirms that in the implementation of the current programmes, no aid should be granted to investments increasing the production capacity of this type of product.\n\n6. The Commission points out that the estimated investment needs contained in this programme do not imply any commitment to financial participation by the Community.""}]}"

Whereas Article 28 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the losses resulting from the obligation to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered by production levies on the production of A and B sugar and of A and B isoglucose, within certain limits; whereas the third subparagraph of Article 28 (5) of the same Regulation allows, with effect from the 1986/87 marketing year, for the upper limit applicable to the B levy to be increased to a maximum of 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar;

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (1) as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3577/90 (2), and in particular Article 5 (6) thereof,
Whereas Article 5 (1) and (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 provides for the granting of a premium to compensate for any loss of income sustained by producers of sheepmeat and, in certain areas, of goatmeat; whereas those areas are defined in Annex I  to Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1065/86 of 11 April 1986 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat is granted (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3519/86 (4); whereas  Article 5
(8) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 provides for the possibility of granting premiums to producers holding females of the ovine species of certain mountain breeds other than eligible ewes, in certain areas; whereas those sheep and those areas  are defined in the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 872/84 of 31 March 1984 laying down the general rules for the granting of premiums to sheepmeat producers (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1970/87 (6);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the Member States were authorized by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1847/90 (7) to pay an initial advance and by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2758/90 (8) to pay a second advance to  sheepmeat and goatmeat producers; whereas those advances were paid during the 1990 marketing year in certain Member States; whereas the balance to be paid to producers in those Member States should therefore be fixed;
Whereas, under Article 22 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the amount of the premium per ewe and per region is obtained transitionally for the 1990 marketing year by multiplying the loss of income referred to in paragraph 4 of that Article by a  coefficient expressing for each region the annual average production of lamb meat per ewe expressed per 100 kilograms carcase weight; whereas the coefficient for 1990 has not yet been fixed in view of the lack of comprehensive Community statistics;  whereas, pending the fixing of that coefficient, it was agreed to use provisionally the coefficients for 1989, adjusted in accordance with the rules on transition; whereas, for region 1, the loss of income must be reduced by the weighted average of the  variable premiums actually granted and the foreseeable premiums for the remainder of the 1990 marketing year, such average being obtained in accordance with Article 24 (4) of that Regulation; whereas Article 22 (5) of that Regulation also fixes for the  1990 marketing year the premium per female of the caprine species and per female of the ovine species other than eligible ewes at 80 % of the premium per ewe; whereas those statistics are now available; whereas the coefficient should therefore be fixed;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 24 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the losses of income in Great Britain on the one hand (impact of the non-deducted variable premium) and in Ireland and Northern Ireland on the other hand, and the coefficients  expressing the annual average production of lamb meat per ewe are to be gradually merged into a single income loss and single coefficients in proportion to the actual dismantling of the variable slaughter premium during each marketing year;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 4 (3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3007/84 of 26 October 1984 laying down detailed rules for the application of the premium for producers of sheepmeat (9), as last amended Regulation (EEC) No 288/91 (10), the  premium payable per eligible animal is only to be paid where the amount fixed per ewe is equal to or greater than ECU 1; whereas those provisions result in the premium payable in region 3 not being paid; whereas those provisions are without prejudice to  the application of Article 22 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 22 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, for the 1990 marketing year where a premium per ewe is granted for region 2 on application by the parties concerned, a premium per ewe of an amount equal to the premium payable  per ewe in region 2 may be granted in region 3 instead of the premium payable in that region where the recipients have shown, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, that lambs from ewes which they hold have not been slaughtered before two  months of age; whereas that paragraph also provides, for the 1990 marketing year, that a premium per female goat equal to 80 % of the premium payable per ewe in region 2 may be granted in the areas in region 3 referred to in Article 5 (5) of that  Regulation instead of the premium payable in that region where the recipients have shown, to the satisfaction of the competent authority, that the kids from female goats which they hold have not been slaughtered before two months of age;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 22 (8) of that Regulation, the Member States comprising regions 3 and 4 which, to the satisfaction of the Commission, have from the 1990 marketing year introduced a system enabling producers of heavy lambs to be  distinguished from producers of light lambs are to qualify in respect of that mar year, in the case of producers of heavy lambs, for the premium paid in region 2, and, in the case of producers of light lambs, for a premium corresponding to 70 % of the  premium for producers of heavy lambs, that premium also applying to female goats; whereas the two Member States comprising region 4 have introduced such a system for the 1990 marketing year;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in Article 8 (2) of that Regulation; whereas that coefficient was fixed provisionally by  Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3618/89 of 1 December 1989 on the application of the guarantee limitation arrangements for sheepmeat and goatmeat for the 1990 marketing year (11); whereas that coefficient was subsequently corrected by Commission  Regulation (EEC) No 905/91 (12);
Whereas in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic the unit amount of the premium to be granted must be calculated pro rata temporis on the basis of the period of the 1990 marketing year when that territory formed part of the Community;

Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 31(2) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2), and in particular Article 32(7) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 31(1) of Decision 2009/470/EC Community reference laboratories in the field of animal health and live animals may be granted Community aid.
(2) Commission Decision 2008/965/EC (3) granted Community financial assistance up to a maximum of EUR 400 000 at the rate of 100 % of the eligible costs as defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1754/2006 of 28 November 2006 laying down detailed rules for the granting of Community financial assistance to Community reference laboratories for feed and food and the animal health sector (4) to be incurred by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), New Haw, Weybridge, United Kingdom, the Community Reference Laboratory (CRL) for avian influenza, for the work programme to be implemented in the period from 1 January to 31 December 2009.
(3) The approved work programme of the CRL for avian influenza foresees that, in the light of the occurrence of influenza in birds and other animals, it is necessary to keep under review the possible zoonotic impact arising from the risk of these influenza viruses.
(4) The novel A/H1N1 influenza virus recently reported in humans in Mexico, USA and then elsewhere in the world contains genetic material of pig, bird and human influenza viruses but it appears to be distinct from other H1N1 viruses known to occur in pigs. The finding of the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus in a swine herd in Canada is the first reported possible case of human-to-animal transmission of this particular new virus subtype. However, the importance of these findings is still to be fully understood and assessed by the scientific community once sufficient scientific data are made available.
(5) The investigation of infection dynamics, pathogenesis, host susceptibility and transmissibility of the current novel A/H1N1 influenza virus in different animal species, and in particular in pigs is essential for providing the necessary scientific evidence for a veterinary risk assessment. A key output from the study will be the development of a ‘toolkit’ of reagents and materials for laboratory diagnosis.
(6) These investigations should be incorporated into the 2009 annual work programme of the CRL for avian influenza which has already developed models for studying infection parameters and performed some testing with influenza viruses from a variety of sources. Complementary investigations will utilise pigs, and, through a combination of multi-factorial measurements will aim at providing evidence for susceptibility and potential consequences of infection of pigs with the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus. All experiments (both on animals and in laboratory) will be carried under strict respect of biosafety and biocontainment conditions already applied at the CRL for avian influenza.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1754/2006 provides that the financial assistance from the Community is to be granted if the approved work programmes are efficiently carried out and the beneficiaries supply all the necessary information within certain time limits.
(8) The Commission has assessed the amended complementary work programme and corresponding amended budget estimates submitted by the CRL for avian influenza.
(9) Accordingly, an additional Community financial assistance should be granted to the CRL for avian influenza to carry out the complementary investigations on the novel A/H1N1 influenza virus.
(10) In accordance with Article 3(2)(a) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (5), animal disease eradication and control programmes (veterinary measures) shall be financed from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). Furthermore, Article 13, second paragraph of that Regulation foresees that in duly justified exceptional cases, for measures and programmes covered by Council Decision 90/424/EEC (6), expenditure relating to administrative and personnel costs incurred by Member States and beneficiaries of aid from the EAGF shall be borne by the Fund and in this case the expenditure proposed qualifies as justified. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 are to apply.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 191, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The situation of the pigmeat market in Ireland is particularly critical taken into account the recent findings of elevated levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in pigmeat originating in Ireland. The competent authorities have taken various measures to address the situation.
(2) Contaminated animal feed was delivered to pig and cattle farms in Ireland. The affected pig farms constitute 7 % of the total pig production in Ireland. The contaminated feed constitutes a very large portion of the pig diet resulting in elevated levels of dioxins in meat from pigs from the affected farms. Given the difficulties in tracing back the pigmeat to farms and given the elevated levels of dioxin found in the affected pigmeat, the Irish authorities decided to recall, as a precautionary measure, all pigmeat and pigmeat products from the market.
(3) Given the exceptional circumstances and the practical difficulties that the pigmeat market in Ireland is experiencing, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 1278/2008 of 17 December 2008 adopting emergency support measures for the pigmeat market in form of private storage aid in Ireland (2).
(4) The dioxin contamination and the application of the precautionary measure to recall all pigmeat and pigmeat products is causing very serious disturbance of the pigmeat market in Ireland. This situation is directly linked to a loss of consumer confidence arising from potential risks to public health. In addition, some cattle remained on farms where samples from other cattle had shown elevated levels of dioxin. Therefore, the Irish authorities have requested the Commission to provide further emergency support measures for the pigmeat and beef market in Ireland.
(5) The European Council of 11 and 12 December 2008 invited the Commission to support farmers and slaughterhouses in Ireland by way of co-financed measures to remove relevant animals and products from the market.
(6) Section I of Chapter II of Part II of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides for exceptional support measures. In particular Article 44 thereof provides that the Commission may adopt exceptional market support measures in case of animal diseases and Article 45 provides that, with regard to the poultrymeat and eggs sectors, the Commission may adopt exceptional market support measures in order to take account of serious market disturbances directly attributed to a loss in consumer confidence due to public health, or animal health risks. In order to resolve the practical problems arising from the current situation of the pigmeat and beef market in Ireland, it is appropriate to take a temporary exceptional measure to support that market, similar to those laid down in Section I.
(7) That exceptional market support measure should be in the form of a disposal scheme of certain pigs and cattle that come from farms that have used contaminated feed. Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide for a disposal scheme of pigmeat products that are blocked in or under the responsibility and control of slaughterhouses in Ireland, and for which it is uncertain to what extent these products have come from pigs that came from farms that used contaminated feed. The measure should remove the possibility that products from animals that may contain elevated levels of contamination enter the food or feed chain.
(8) That exceptional market support measure should be partly financed by the Community. The contribution of the Community in the compensation should be expressed as maximum average amounts per animal or tonne of pigmeat, for a limited quantity of the products concerned, while the Irish authorities should be required to determine the compensation price and thus the amount of the part-financing based on the market value of the animals and the products compensated for within specified limits.
(9) The competent Irish authorities should apply all controls and surveillance measures required for the proper application of the exceptional measure provided for in this Regulation and inform the Commission accordingly.
(10) Given that for reasons of animal welfare, public health and market supply, the Irish authorities had to start the disposal of the animals as well as of the products concerned as of 13 December 2008, it is necessary to provide that this Regulation should apply as of that date.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '31.1.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 29/41', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 94/2009\nof 30 January 2009\nadopting temporary exceptional support measure for the pigmeat and beef market in form of a disposal scheme in Ireland', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The situation of the pigmeat market in Ireland is particularly critical taken into account the recent findings of elevated levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in pigmeat originating in Ireland.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organisation of the market in sugar (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1148/98 (2), and in particular Articles 14(2) and 37(6) thereof,
Whereas Article 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 lays down that, during the marketing years 1995/96 to 2000/01 and in order to ensure adequate supplies to Community refineries, a special reduced duty is to be levied on imports of raw cane sugar originating in States with which the Community has concluded supply arrangements on preferential terms; whereas at present such agreements have been concluded by Council Decision 95/284/EC (3) only with the ACP States party to Protocol 8 on ACP sugar annexed to the Fourth ACP-EEC Lomé Convention, and with the Republic of India;
Whereas the quantities of special preferential sugar to be imported are calculated in accordance with the said Article 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 on the basis of a Community forecast supply balance; whereas the balance has indicated the need to import raw sugar and to open at this stage for the 1998/99 marketing year a tariff quota at the special reduced rate of duty as provided for in the abovementioned agreements so that the Community refineries' supply need can be met for part of the year; whereas tariff quotas have in this way been opened by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1375/98 (4) for the period 1 July 1998 to 28 February 1999; whereas the production forecasts for raw cane sugar are now available for the 1998/99 marketing year; whereas the necessary tariff quotas should consequently be opened for the second part of the marketing year; whereas, because of the presumed maximum refining needs fixed by Member States and the shortfall resulting from the forecast supply balance, provision should be made to authorise imports for each refining Member State, for the period 1 March to 30 June 1999;
Whereas the above agreements lay down that the refiners in question must pay a minimum purchase price equal to the guaranteed price for raw sugar, minus the adjustment aid fixed for the marketing year in question; whereas this minimum price must therefore be fixed by taking account of the factors applying in the 1998/99 marketing year;
Whereas in order to avoid a rupture of supplies, provision should be made in respect of the quantities to be imported under Regulation (EC) No 1375/98 for which the licences have not been requested up to 28 February 1999, for the Member States concerned to be authorised to issue the said licences after that date during the 1998/99 marketing year;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/82/EC (2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 1 August 1995 an application from Dow Elanco Europe (now Dow Agro Sciences), for the inclusion of the active substance quinoxyfen in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 96/457/EEC (3) confirmed that the dossier was‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The nominated rapporteur Member State, submitted a draft assessment report concerning the substance to the Commission on 11 October 1996.
(3) The draft assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 28 November 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for quinoxyfen.
(4) The documents and information were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants for separate consultation. The Committee was asked to comment on the accumulation of the substance in soil and on its potential environmental impact. In its opinion (4), the Committee noted that the available studies and the field study on organic matter degradation (litter bag study) in particular did not convincingly demonstrate an acceptable impact on the environment, mainly due to insufficient statistical power of the experimental design. The Committee further noted that a fraction of the applied quinoxyfen may volatilise after application to a crop. Although available results indicate a rapid decomposition of the substance in air, the Committee suggested that measurements of the half-life should be repeated after appropriate schemes have been developed for assessing the environmental risks of atmospheric transport of plant protection products. This recommendation of the Committee was taken into account in the review report of the active substance.
(5) In accordance with Article 6(4) of Directive 91/414/EEC and in view of a possible unfavourable decision for quinoxyfen the Commission organised a tripartite meeting with the main data submitter and the rapporteur Member State on 13 February 2003. The main data submitter provided further data in order to meet the initial concerns.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing quinoxyfen may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include quinoxyfen in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) The Commission review report is required for the proper implementation by the Member States, of several sections of the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide that the finalised review report, except for confidential information within the meaning of Article 14 of Directive 91/414/EEC, should be kept available or made available by the Member States for consultation by any interested parties.
(8) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing quinoxyfen and in particular to review existing provisional authorisations and, by the end of this period at the latest, to transform those authorisations into full authorisations, to amend them or to withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

Whereas Article 26 (1) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that rape and sunflower seed may be bought in by an intervention agency, in particular where the Community market price for such seeds is lower than the buying-in price; whereas Article 2 of Commission Regulation No 282/67/EEC (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2709/87 (4), must specify the conditions under which intervention buying is to be authorized or suspended and the components to be taken into account for determining the Community market prices;
Whereas recourse to intervention on the slightest movement of prices must be avoided; whereas intervention purchasing should be triggered off only if market prices persistently remain below the intervention price; whereas a period of at least two weeks during which market prices are lower than the intervention price, should be required;
Whereas market prices recorded at locations outside production areas must be corrected by an amount representing the costs of movement between the main production areas and these locations; whereas this must be a fixed amount set on the basis of the different forms of transport used and of the distances between the production areas and these locations;
Whereas if the intervention arrangements are to run satisfactorily the number of locations at which prices are recorded must be kept to a strict minimum;
Whereas it is necessary for the Commission to obtain information on seed market prices in the Community;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 605/86 of 28 February 1986 laying down transitional arrangements relating to the detailed rules for the buying in of oil seeds by intervention agencies in Spain and Portugal (5) stipulates that during the period 1 November to 31 December 1987 the minimum quantities of oil seeds that may be offered for intervention in Spain and in Portugal are 60 and 30 tonnes respectively; whereas this provision will remain applicable after this Regulation enters into force;
Whereas under the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal prices and aid in these countries for certain oil and fat sector products differ from those applicable in the rest of the Community and the market in these products in the two countries, particularly in oil seeds, is subject to trade restrictions until 31 December 1990; whereas consequently the markets in both countries present special characteristics requiring specific arrangements for reporting market prices in connection with the triggering off and termination of intervention purchasing;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
After consulting the Economic and Financial Committee,
Whereas:
(1) On 4 January 2007 the authorities of Lebanon adopted a comprehensive programme of socio-economic reforms, which simultaneously embraces fiscal, structural and social measures, setting medium-term priorities for government action.
(2) Lebanon, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States on the other hand, have signed an Association Agreement (1), which entered into force on 1 April 2006.
(3) The authorities of Lebanon are committed to economic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a programme under the Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) which was approved on 9 April 2007.
(4) Relations between Lebanon and the European Union are developing within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is expected to lead to deeper economic integration. The EU and Lebanon have agreed on a European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan identifying medium-term priorities in EU-Lebanon relations and related policies.
(5) Lebanon faces substantial financing needs arising from the mounting financial constraints of the public sector, including a high level of public debt, aggravated by the July-August 2006 military conflict and a projected deterioration of the balance of payments in 2007.
(6) The Lebanese authorities have requested financial assistance on a concessional basis from the International Financial Institutions, the Community and other bilateral donors. Over and above the financing from the IMF and the World Bank, a substantial residual financing gap remains to be covered to relieve the country’s balance of payments, public finances and public debt and support the policy objectives attached to the authorities’ reform efforts.
(7) Lebanon is one of the most indebted countries in the world facing a heavy debt overhang. In these circumstances, the Community assistance to Lebanon should be made available in the form of a combination of a grant and loan, as an appropriate measure to help the beneficiary country at this critical juncture.
(8) In order to ensure efficient protection of the Community’s financial interests linked to the present financial assistance, it is necessary to provide for appropriate measures by Lebanon related to the prevention of, and to the fight against, fraud, corruption and any other irregularities linked to this assistance, as well as for controls by the Commission and audits by the Court of Auditors.
(9) The release of the Community financial assistance is without prejudice to the powers of the budgetary authority.
(10) This assistance should be managed by the Commission in consultation with the Economic and Financial Committee,","{'header': '21.12.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 337/111', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 10 December 2007\nproviding Community macro-financial assistance to Lebanon\n(2007/860/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 4 January 2007 the authorities of Lebanon adopted a comprehensive programme of socio-economic reforms, which simultaneously embraces fiscal, structural and social measures, setting medium-term priorities for government action.\n\n((2)) Lebanon, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States on the other hand, have signed an Association Agreement(1), which entered into force on 1 April 2006.\n\n((3)) The authorities of Lebanon are committed to economic stabilisation and structural reforms, supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) through a programme under the Emergency Post-Conflict Arrangement (EPCA) which was approved on 9 April 2007.\n\n((4)) Relations between Lebanon and the European Union are developing within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, which is expected to lead to deeper economic integration.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of 22 December 1994 on protection against  dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community  (1), as last amended by  Regulation (EC) No 1251/95  (2), in particular Article 23 thereof, which provides that Council  Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from  countries not members of the European Economic Community  (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC)  No 522/94  (4), shall continue to apply to proceedings in relation to which an investigation  pending on 1 September 1994 had not been concluded by the date of entry into force of Regulation  (EC) No 3283/94,
Having regard to Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, and in particular Articles 10 (6) and 14 thereof,
After consultation with the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
I.  PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1)  The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 1798/90  (5), as amended by  Regulations (EEC) No 2966/92  (6) and (EEC) No 2455/93  (7), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty  on imports of monosodium glutamate originating in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan, and  Thailand with the exception of imports from certain producers in these countries from which the  Commission accepted undertakings by Regulation (EEC) No 547/90  (8) and Decisions 92/493/EEC  (9)  and 93/479/EEC  (10).
(2)  During the review concluded by Regulation (EEC) No 2455/93 and Decision 93/479/EEC, all the  companies were informed of the essential facts and considerations on which it was intended to amend  the measures and were given the opportunity to make their views known. The Commission subsequently  accepted price undertakings from all known exporters. Exports from these countries made by other  exporters, which in this case were negligible, continued to be subject to anti-dumping duty.
(3)  By a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (11), the  Commission, after consultation with the Advisory Committee and in accordance with Article 14 of  Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Basic Regulation`), initiated a review  of the anti-dumping measures in force, following receipt of an application lodged by the Community  industry. The application alleged, inter alia, that the monosodium glutamate originating in the  countries concerned had been imported into the Community at prices lower than those required by the  existing price undertakings and, therefore, that the price undertakings are not suitable measures  in this proceeding. It should be noted that, with two exceptions, all exporters from which  undertakings have been accepted cooperated in this review. The following exporters cooperated in  this review:
Indonesia:
-  PT Indomiwon Citra Inti,
-  PT Jico Argung (related selling company of PT Indomiwon Citra Inti);
Republic of Korea:
-  Cheil Foods & Chemicals Inc.,
-  Miwon Co. Ltd,
-  Miwon Trading & Shipping Co., Ltd (related selling company of Miwon Co. Ltd);
Taiwan:
-  Ve Wong Corporation,
-  Tung Hai Fermentation Ind. Corp.;
Thailand:
-  Thai Fermentation Industry Corporation.
(4)  The product covered by the application and for which the review investigation was initiated is  monosodium glutamate produced in the form of crystals of various sizes and falling within CN code  ex  2922  42  10. It is mainly used as a flavour enhancer in soups, broths, fish and meat dishes  and ready made foods. The product is the same as that in the Regulation under review.
II.  REASONS TO BELIEVE THAT UNDERTAKINGS HAD BEEN VIOLATED
(5)  The application giving rise to  the abovementioned review, alleged, inter alia, that price undertakings had been violated. While  this review is still in progress and any conclusions on this issue are therefore necessarily  provisional, an examination of the allegation that price undertakings had been violated led to the  following results:
The Commission requested information on resale prices for the product concerned from all importers  having purchased monosodium glutamate from those exporters which cooperated in the abovementioned  review. The period for which such information was requested, i.e. 1 May 1993 to 30 April 1994,  corresponded to the investigation period of the review.
Information was received from independent importers relating to resale prices in the Community of  approximately 21  % of all the cooperating exporters' sales to the European Community. It covered  resales of the product concerned purchased from the aforementioned Indonesian, Korean and Taiwanese  exporters.
In spite of the fact that the Commission could only investigate resale prices from those importers  who agreed to cooperate, it found clear indications that the price undertakings were being violated  by the aforementioned Indonesian, Korean and Taiwanese exporters, as the great majority of resales  of the product concerned originating from each of them were made at prices which could not cover  the importers' purchase prices (i.e. set at the undertaking level) plus a reasonable amount for  selling, general and administrative expenses, profit and, where appropriate, customs duty. The  resale prices of this sample of transactions reflected the general situation on the Community  market, as described by the applicant.
Even if the export prices, taken at their face value did correspond to the terms of the  undertakings, the level of the resale prices of the merchandise in the Community nevertheless  constitutes a strong indication that compensation, in whatever form, was granted by the exporters  to their customers in the Community. This would constitute a violation of the undertakings.
(6)  In addition, two exporters refused to cooperate properly in the abovementioned review.
One of these exporters made some exports of the product concerned to a non-cooperating importer  located in Germany. The exporter concerned did not disclose fully its relationship with the German  importer, while the Commission had strong reasons to believe that these two companies were  related.
The other exporter submitted a response to the questionnaire which was issued in the course of the  abovementioned review, but it refused to cooperate in the verification of the information contained  therein.
(7)  Taking into consideration all the facts set out in recitals 5 and 6, the Commission concluded  that, in accordance with Article 10 (6) of the Basic Regulation, there were reasons to believe that  the price undertakings accepted by the Commission from the abovementioned exporters had been  violated. In these circumstances, the price undertakings concerned should be withdrawn and replaced  by a provisional anti-dumping duty based on the facts established before the acceptance of these  price undertakings.
III.  COMMUNITY INTEREST
(8)  The Council, in Regulation (EEC) No 2455/93, concluded that it was  in the Community interest that measures be imposed on imports of monosodium glutamate from the four  countries concerned.
(9)  It has been provisionally found that the conclusions on Community interest as set out in the  above Regulation are still valid and should remain unchanged. Moreover, it is in the fundamental  interest of the Community to take action in cases where undertakings are violated, as such  violation constitutes a circumvention of measures that have been duly adopted and should therefore  be remedied.
(10)  In the light of the above, it was considered to be in the interest of the Community that the  acceptance by the Commission of the price undertakings from the abovementioned companies be  withdrawn and replaced by a provisional anti-dumping duty.
IV.  EXPORTERS' COMMENTS
(11)  In accordance with Article 10 (6) of the Basic Regulation, the  exporters concerned were given the opportunity of expressing their views on the Commission's  observations and its intention to impose provisional anti-dumping duties. Their comments were taken  into account as appropriate.
V.  PROVISIONAL DUTIES
(12)  In the light of the above, the Commission concludes that, pursuant  to Article 10 (6) of the Basic Regulation, provisional duties should be calculated on the basis of  the facts established before the undertakings were accepted. The rate of duty corresponding to the  injury margin necessary to eliminate injurious dumping was established during the earlier  investigation for each exporter as an alternative to the price undertakings accepted by Decision  93/479/EEC. The amounts of these duties were disclosed to the exporters concerned and were not  disputed by them.
VI.  FINAL PROVISION
(13)  In the interests of sound administration, a period should be fixed  within which the parties concerned may make their views known in writing and request a hearing.  Furthermore, it should be stated that all findings made for the purpose of this Regulation are  provisional and may be reconsidered for the purpose of any definitive duty which the Commission may  propose,","{'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1754/95 of 18 July 1995 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of monosodium glutamate originating in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) Since the elections of April 1994 and the establishment of a democratic government, the Community has turned towards a strategy of support for the policies and reforms undertaken by the South African authorities.
(2) The Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2259/96 of 22 November 1996 on development cooperation with South Africa(3); that Regulation expired on 31 December 1999.
(3) The Agreement on trade, development and cooperation between the European Community and the Republic of South Africa stipulates in Chapter VII thereof that financial assistance in the form of grants is to be covered by a special financial facility established under the Community budget, that the Community declares its willingness to maintain its financial cooperation with South Africa at a substantial level, and that it will take the necessary decisions in this respect on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
(4) The abovementioned Agreement contains in Chapter V thereof provisions on aims, priorities, methods and implementation of development cooperation with South Africa.
(5) In the light of the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2259/96 and of Special Report No 7/98 of the Court of Auditors in respect of the European Community development aid programme regarding South Africa (1986 to 1996), development cooperation with South Africa should be continued subject to adaptations, in particular as regards simplification of procedures, greater focus on sectoral priorities and decentralised decision-making.
(6) Assistance provided under this Regulation should be implemented in coherence with actions of other donors, including multilateral institutions.
(7) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(4).
(8) This Regulation lays down, for the entire duration of the programme, a financial framework constituting the principal point of reference, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 May 1999 on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(5), for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure.

of 26 August 2004
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000(1), (EC) No 2433/2000(2), (EC) No 2434/2000(3) and (EC) No 2435/2000(4) establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements with the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Romania respectively, and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000 and (EC) No 2435/2000, the European Community has undertaken to establish for each marketing year from 1 July 2000 import tariff quotas at a reduced or zero rate of duty for 2750 tonnes of common wheat (serial No 09.4663) and 1750 tonnes of millet (serial No 09.4664) originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, 34250 tonnes of barley for the production of malt (serial No 09.4617), 16875 tonnes of wheat flour (serial No 09.4618) and 45250 tonnes of malt, not roasted, other than of wheat (serial No 09.4619) originating in the Czech Republic, 17000 tonnes of barley for the production of malt (serial No 09.4617), 16875 tonnes of wheat flour (serial No 09.4618) and 18125 tonnes of malt, not roasted, other than of wheat (serial No 09.4619) originating in the Slovak Republic, and 25000 tonnes of common wheat (serial No 09.4759) originating in Romania respectively.
(2) Regulations (EC) No 2290/2000, (EC) No 2433/2000, (EC) No 2434/2000 and (EC) No 2435/2000 lay down that some of these quotas are to be administered in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1602/2000(6). In the interest of simplification and taking into account the small volume of quotas for products originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the above provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 should also be applied to these quotas.
(3) To ensure that imports of the cereals sector products covered by the Czech, Slovak and Romanian tariff quotas are orderly and not speculative, they should be made subject to the issue of import licences. The licences will be issued, within the quantities set, at the request of the interested parties after a period of reflection and subject, where appropriate, to the fixing of a reduction coefficient in respect of the quantities applied for.
(4) To ensure the proper management of these quotas, deadlines for lodging licence applications should be laid down and, notwithstanding Articles 8 and 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(7), the information to be included in the applications and licences should be specified.
(5) To take account of delivery conditions, the import licences should be valid from the day of their issue until the end of the month following that in which they are issued.
(6) To ensure efficient management of the quota, the import licences should not be transferable and the import licence security should be fixed at a relatively high level, notwithstanding Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2110/2000(9).
(7) For the same reasons rapid two-way communication must be established between the Commission and the Member States regarding the quantities applied for and imported.
(8) The import duties on products falling within CN codes 1107 10 19 and 1001 90 99 (serial No 09.4619 for the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic and serial No 09.4759 for Romania) listed in points II, III and VI of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1218/96(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2511/2000(11), as worded before the entry into force of this Regulation and imported under licences applied for on or after 1 July 2000 are reimbursed in accordance with Articles 878 to 898 of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1218/96 lays down detailed rules applying to the import of certain cereals originating in the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Romania under quotas opened by Council Regulation (EC) No 3066/95(12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2435/98(13).

(2) Accidental releases of those active substances recently reported by several Member States have resulted in substantial losses of honey bee colonies. As a consequence, the Member States concerned have taken precautionary measures to temporarily suspend the placing on the market of plant protection products containing those substances.
(3) Clothianidin, thiamethoxam, and imidacloprid may only be authorised for uses as insecticide, including the use as seed treatment. Fipronil, however, may only be authorised for uses as insecticide for use as seed treatment. The accidents reported by Member States concern the inappropriate use of those active substances to treat seeds.
(4) To avoid future accidents, additional provisions, including appropriate risk mitigation measures, should be laid down for clothianidin, thiamethoxam, fipronil and imidacloprid.
(5) Directive 91/414/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 54 (2) and (3) and Article 63 (2) and (3) thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment (1), and in particular Title IV D thereof;
Having regard to the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom to provide services (2), and in particular Title V C thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (3);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (4);
Whereas the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community contains no provisions regarding freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services ; whereas, therefore, liberalisation of the activities covered by this Directive comes entirely under the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Whereas activities in wholesale trade and the activities of intermediaries in commerce, industry and small craft industries are already governed by two Council Directives of 25 February 1964 (5) ; whereas the coal trade is excluded from the scope of these Directives ; whereas the purpose of this Directive is to liberalise trade activities in that sector;
Whereas, moreover, the present Directive affects the selling activities of producers, since Article 2 (3) of the Council Directive of 7 July 1964 (6) concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in mining and quarrying (ISIC Major Groups 11-19) restricts the rights of a producer who establishes himself as such in another Member State and sells his own products in that State to selling in a single establishment in the country of production, until such time as trade in the products in question has been liberalised by other Directives;
Whereas the present Directive liberalises the wholesale coal trade ; whereas retail trade has already been liberalised by the Council Directive of 15 October 1968 (7) ; whereas therefore the restriction to selling in a single establishment in the country of production no longer applies to such products;
whereas the producer who, on the basis of the Council Directive of 7 July 1964 referred to above, establishes himself as such in another Member State is, in pursuance of that Directive, henceforth authorised to sell his own products in one or more undertakings in that Member State;
Whereas the present Directive must also enable a producer to establish himself in another Member State not as a producer but in order to sell his own products in that State, on a wholesale basis, in one or more undertakings;  (1)OJ No 2, 15.1.1962, p. 36/62.

(7)OJ No L 260, 22.10.1968, p. 1.
Whereas the restrictions on freedom to provide services in respect of intermediaries in the employment of one or more industrial or commercial undertakings should be abolished under this Directive ; whereas it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between activities of employed intermediaries and those of self-employed agents because the legal distinction between the two is not the same in all six countries ; whereas the activities of employed intermediaries fall within the same economic category as those of self-employed agents and it would be neither convenient nor useful to split up the liberalisation of this very special form of provision of services into a series of measures of partial liberalisation, effected as and when the activities of the employers are liberalised;
Whereas the General Programme for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment provides that restrictions on the right to join professional or trade organisations must be abolished where the professional activities of the person concerned necessarily involve the exercise of that right;
Whereas the position of paid employees accompanying the person providing services or acting on his behalf will be governed by the provisions laid down in pursuance of Articles 48 and 49 of the Treaty;
Whereas separate Directives, applicable to all activities of self-employed persons, concerning provisions relating to the movement and residence of beneficiaries, and where necessary Directives on the co-ordination of the safeguards required by Member States of companies or firms for the protection of the interests of members and of others, have been or will be adopted;
Whereas, moreover, in some Member States the wholesale coal trade is governed by rules relating to the taking up of that trade ; whereas, therefore, certain transitional measures, the purpose of which is to make it easier for nationals of other Member States to take up and pursue activities in wholesale trade, are the subject of a separate Directive;","{'title': 'Council Directive 70/522/EEC of 30 November 1970 concerning the attainment of freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of activities of self-employed persons in the wholesale coal trade and activities of intermediaries in the coal trade (ISIC ex Group 6112)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMember States shall abolish, in respect of the natural persons and companies or firms covered by Title I of the General Programmes for the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services (hereinafter called ""beneficiaries""), the restrictions referred to in Title III of those General Programmes affecting the right to take up and pursue the activities specified in Articles 2 and 3 of this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products in the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) The refunds must be fixed taking into account the factors referred to in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals (2).
(3) As far as wheat and rye flour, groats and meal are concerned, when the refund on these products is being calculated, account must be taken of the quantities of cereals required for their manufacture. These quantities were fixed in Regulation (EC) No 1501/95.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(5) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) It follows from applying the detailed rules set out above to the present situation on the market in cereals, and in particular to quotations or prices for these products within the Community and on the world market, that the refunds should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(2), second subparagraph, thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) has been notified on 23 April 2008 that sunflower oil originating from Ukraine was found contaminated with high levels of mineral oil. This contamination by mineral oil was later confirmed in several consignments of crude sunflower oil originating from Ukraine imported in recent months in the Community. Sunflower oil containing high levels of mineral oil is unfit for human consumption and therefore deemed to be unsafe. The source of contamination is not yet known.
(2) The European Commission has repeatedly urged the Ukrainian authorities to provide information on the origin of the contamination and on the measures taken to prevent it in future. Assurances were also sought from the Ukrainian authorities as to the establishment of effective measures aimed at guaranteeing the appropriate sampling and analysis on the presence of mineral oil in consignments of sunflower oil leaving Ukraine with destination the European Community.
(3) Investigations aimed at identifying the source of contamination are ongoing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities also committed to the establishment of an appropriate control system that will ensure that all consignments of sunflower oil to be exported to the European Union are certified as not containing levels of mineral oil making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. However, the details of this control system have still to be provided to the Commission. The Commission should assess the control and certification system in order to verify the accuracy and the reliability to guarantee that the sunflower oil exported to the Community does not contain levels of mineral oil, making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. It has to be ensured that no exports of sunflower oil to the Community will take place until such control and certification system is put in place and assessed and accepted by the Commission. The assessment of the control and certification system will be performed on the basis of detailed information provided by the Ukrainian authorities.
(4) After a request from the European Commission for an assessment of the risks related to the contamination of sunflower oil with mineral oil, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a statement on the contamination of sunflower oil with mineral oil exported from Ukraine. The statement refers to assessments performed by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) indicating the different level of toxicity depending of the type of mineral oil. EFSA concluded that the available analytical data for the contaminated sunflower oil from Ukraine indicated that the mineral oil present was of high viscosity. Based upon exposure estimates, EFSA concluded that the exposure of sunflower oil contaminated with high viscosity mineral oil, although being undesirable for human consumption, would not be of public health concern in this case. Given that the source of contamination has not yet been identified with certainty, there is the presumption of risk attached to the presence of unacceptable high levels of mineral oil in sunflower oil.
(5) Given the level of risk, even once the control and certification system will be accepted by the Commission, Member States should control the consignments of sunflower oil in order to verify that such consignments contain a level of mineral oil conform to what it is declared in the certificate. This system of double control is necessary and justified in order to provide additional guarantees for the accuracy and reliability of the control and certification system put in place by the Ukrainian authorities. The costs incurred for carrying out these controls are to be borne by the operators responsible for the import. Member States should inform the Commission of unfavourable results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Favourable results shall be reported to the Commission on a three-monthly basis. This obligation of information is necessary for the measures to be reassessed.
(6) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(7) Pending the assessment and acceptance of the control and certification system to be put in place by the Ukrainian authorities, no imports of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine should take place due to the risk of contamination with mineral oil.
(8) Member States have been informed of the contamination incident and have taken the appropriate measures to withdraw the contaminated sunflower oil and food products containing contaminated sunflower oil already placed on the market, as recommended by the European Commission via the RASFF.
(9) Given the urgency, pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and after having informed the authorities of Ukraine, the Commission adopted Decision 2008/388/EC on 23 May 2008 imposing special conditions governing the import of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine due to contamination risks by mineral oil (2), in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(2), first subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.

This contamination by mineral oil was later confirmed in several consignments of crude sunflower oil originating from Ukraine imported in recent months in the Community. Sunflower oil containing high levels of mineral oil is unfit for human consumption and therefore deemed to be unsafe. The source of contamination is not yet known.\n\n((2)) The European Commission has repeatedly urged the Ukrainian authorities to provide information on the origin of the contamination and on the measures taken to prevent it in future. Assurances were also sought from the Ukrainian authorities as to the establishment of effective measures aimed at guaranteeing the appropriate sampling and analysis on the presence of mineral oil in consignments of sunflower oil leaving Ukraine with destination the European Community.\n\n((3)) Investigations aimed at identifying the source of contamination are ongoing in Ukraine. The Ukrainian authorities also committed to the establishment of an appropriate control system that will ensure that all consignments of sunflower oil to be exported to the European Union are certified as not containing levels of mineral oil making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. However, the details of this control system have still to be provided to the Commission. The Commission should assess the control and certification system in order to verify the accuracy and the reliability to guarantee that the sunflower oil exported to the Community does not contain levels of mineral oil, making the sunflower oil unfit for human consumption. It has to be ensured that no exports of sunflower oil to the Community will take place until such control and certification system is put in place and assessed and accepted by the Commission. The assessment of the control and certification system will be performed on the basis of detailed information provided by the Ukrainian authorities.\n\n((4)) After a request from the European Commission for an assessment of the risks related to the contamination of sunflower oil with mineral oil, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a statement on the contamination of sunflower oil with mineral oil exported from Ukraine. The statement refers to assessments performed by the joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) indicating the different level of toxicity depending of the type of mineral oil. EFSA concluded that the available analytical data for the contaminated sunflower oil from Ukraine indicated that the mineral oil present was of high viscosity. Based upon exposure estimates, EFSA concluded that the exposure of sunflower oil contaminated with high viscosity mineral oil, although being undesirable for human consumption, would not be of public health concern in this case. Given that the source of contamination has not yet been identified with certainty, there is the presumption of risk attached to the presence of unacceptable high levels of mineral oil in sunflower oil.\n\n((5)) Given the level of risk, even once the control and certification system will be accepted by the Commission, Member States should control the consignments of sunflower oil in order to verify that such consignments contain a level of mineral oil conform to what it is declared in the certificate. This system of double control is necessary and justified in order to provide additional guarantees for the accuracy and reliability of the control and certification system put in place by the Ukrainian authorities. The costs incurred for carrying out these controls are to be borne by the operators responsible for the import. Member States should inform the Commission of unfavourable results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Favourable results shall be reported to the Commission on a three-monthly basis. This obligation of information is necessary for the measures to be reassessed.\n\n((6)) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.\n\n((7)) Pending the assessment and acceptance of the control and certification system to be put in place by the Ukrainian authorities, no imports of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine should take place due to the risk of contamination with mineral oil.\n\n((8)) Member States have been informed of the contamination incident and have taken the appropriate measures to withdraw the contaminated sunflower oil and food products containing contaminated sunflower oil already placed on the market, as recommended by the European Commission via the RASFF.\n\n((9)) Given the urgency, pending the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, and after having informed the authorities of Ukraine, the Commission adopted Decision 2008/388/EC on 23 May 2008 imposing special conditions governing the import of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine due to contamination risks by mineral oil(2), in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(2), first subparagraph of Regulation (EC) No\xa0178/2002.\n\n((10)) Those measures should be confirmed and amended as regards the costs of the controls, performed by the competent authorities of the Member States.\n\n((11)) It is therefore appropriate to repeal and replace Decision 2008/388/EC.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall prohibit the import of sunflower oil, falling within CN codes 1512\xa011\xa091 or 1512199010, originating in or consigned from Ukraine (hereafter referred to as sunflower oil), unless the consignment of sunflower oil is accompanied by a valid certificate, certifying the absence of unacceptable levels of mineral oil and the results of sampling and analysis for the presence of mineral oil.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The certificate provided for in paragraph 1 shall only be valid for imports of consignments of sunflower oil into the Community if the sampling and analysis of the consignment and the issuance of the certificate have taken place after the European Commission has assessed and formally accepted the control and certification system put in place by the Ukrainian authorities.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States will be informed of the details of the control and certification system put in place by the Ukrainian authorities and of the formal acceptance of it by the Commission through the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall take the appropriate measures to sample and analyse each consignment of sunflower oil originating in or consigned from Ukraine, accompanied by a valid certificate, presented for import to ensure that the consignments contain a level of mineral oil conform to what it is declared in the certificate.\nThey shall inform the Commission of unfavourable results through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules (1), and in particular Article 17(3) and (6) and Article 21(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 established quantitative restrictions on imports of certain textile products originating in certain third countries to be allocated on a first come, first served basis.
(2) Under that Regulation it is possible, in certain circumstances, to use other allocation methods, to divide quotas into tranches, or to reserve a proportion of a specific quantitative limit exclusively for applications which are supported by evidence of the results of past import performance.
(3) Rules for management of the quotas established for 2007 should be adopted before the quota year begins so that the continuity of trade flows is not affected unduly.
(4) The measures adopted in previous years, such as those in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2038/2005 of 14 December 2005 laying down rules for the management and distribution of textile quotas established for the year 2006 under Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 (2), proved to be satisfactory and it is therefore appropriate to adopt similar rules for 2007.
(5) In order to satisfy the greatest possible number of operators it is appropriate to make the ‘first come, first served’ allocation method more flexible by placing a ceiling on the quantities which can be allocated to each operator by that method.
(6) To guarantee a degree of continuity in trade and efficient quota administration, operators should be allowed to make their initial import authorisation application for 2007 equivalent to the quantity which they imported in 2006.
(7) To achieve optimum use of the quantities, an operator who has used up at least one half of the amount already authorised should be permitted to apply for a further amount, provided that quantities are available in the quotas.
(8) For the sake of sound administration, import authorisations should be valid for nine months from the date of issue but only until the end of the year at the latest. Member States should issue licences only after being notified by the Commission that quantities are available and only if an operator can prove the existence of a contract and can certify, in the absence of a specific provision to the contrary, that he has not already been allocated a Community import authorisation under this Regulation for the categories and countries concerned. The competent national authorities should, however, be authorised, in response to importers' applications, to extend by three months and up to 31 March 2008 licences of which at least one half has been used by the application date.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 3439/80 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2585 (3), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain polyester yarn originating in the United States of America.
(2) On 23 November 1984 Vita-tex Ltd, Slough, United Kingdom, an importer of polyester yarn from the United States, submitted an application to the United Kingdom authorities for a refund of an amount totalling £ . . . (4) sterling which it had definitively paid in anti-dumping duties on its imports of polyester yarn from the USA. The United Kingdom authorities forwarded the application to the Commission.
(3) The Commission examined the application and informed the applicant of the preliminary result of this examination and gave it an opportunity to comment. The comments made were taken into consideration prior to this Decision.
(4) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. The Commission altered its opinion following new representations made and information supplied by the applicant and the United Kingdom authorities. The Member States were informed of the Commission's revised opinion. None of the Member States disagreed with the revised opinion of the Commission.
B. Argument of the applicant
(5) The applicant has based its application on a comparison between the export prices concerned and the prices of goods sold in the United States of America.
C. Admissibility
(6) Initially the Commission informed the applicant and the Member States that it considered the application inadmissible as it appeared to have been submitted outside the time limit specified in Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84. Following further representations made by the applicant and the United Kingdom authorities the
Commission now accepts that the application was submitted in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular those concerning time limits.
D. Merits of the claim
(7) The applicant included in its application detailed information on the normal values in the United States at the time the imports concerned in the application took place. The Commission is satisfied with the representativeness and completeness of the information presented and therefore the normal values submitted by the applicant have been accepted.
(8) A comparison of the normal values mentioned in paragraph 7 above with the export prices concerned shows that the application is justified.
E. Amount of refund
(9) The amount to be refunded should be equal to the amount by which the duty collected exceeded the difference between the normal values and the export prices. The total difference for the shipments in question amounts to £ . . ..","{'title': '87/232/EEC: Commission Decision of 27 March 1987 concerning the application submitted by Vita-tex Ltd, Slough, United Kingdom, for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on certain imports of polyester yarn originating in the United States of America (Only the English text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe refund application for a total of £ . . . submitted by Vita-Tex Ltd, Slough, United Kingdom, is hereby granted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amount set out in Article 1 shall be refunded by the authorities of the United Kingdom.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom and to Vita-Tex Ltd, Slough, United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 27 March 1987.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nKarl-Heinz NARJES\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 358, 31. 12. 1980, p. 91.\n\n(3) OJ No L 246, 13. 9. 1985, p. 57.\n\n(4) In the published version of the present Decision, some figures have hereinafter been omitted, pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 concerning non-disclosure of business secrets.'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances listed in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 of 27 June 2007 on laying down the procedure for the renewal of the inclusion of a first group of active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and establishing the list of those substances (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. Azimsulfuron is listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 737/2007.
(2) The approval of azimsulfuron, as set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (4), expires on 31 December 2011. A notification was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007 for the renewal of the inclusion of azimsulfuron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within the time period provided for in that Article.
(3) That notification was found to be admissible by Commission Decision 2008/656/EC of 28 July 2008 on the admissibility of the notifications concerning the renewal of the inclusion in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of the active substances azimsulfuron, azoxystrobin, fluroxypyr, imazalil, kresoxim-methyl, prohexadione and spiroxamine, and establishing the list of the notifiers concerned (5).
(4) Within the time period provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 737/2007, the notifier submitted the data required in accordance with that Article together with an explanation as regards the relevance of each new study submitted.
(5) The rapporteur Member State prepared an assessment report in consultation with the co-rapporteur Member State and submitted it to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and the Commission on 1 June 2009. In addition to the assessment of the active substance, that report includes a list of the studies the rapporteur Member State relied on for its assessment.
(6) The Authority communicated the assessment report to the notifier and to the Member States for comments and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the assessment report available to the public.
(7) At the request of the Commission, the assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the Authority. The Authority presented its conclusion on the peer review of the risk assessment of azimsulfuron (6) to the Commission on 12 March 2010. The assessment report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for azimsulfuron.
(8) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing azimsulfuron may be expected to continue to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve azimsulfuron.
(9) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions not provided for in the first inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) Based on the review report, which points out that the manufacturing impurity phenol is of toxicological concern, a maximum level of 2 g/kg should, however, be set for that impurity in the technical material.
(11) From the new data submitted, it appears that azimsulfuron and its degradation products in aqueous photolysis may cause risks for aquatic organisms. Without prejudice to the conclusion that azimsulfuron should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(12) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(13) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing azimsulfuron. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(14) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (7) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(15) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should be amended accordingly.
(16) In the interest of clarity, Commission Directive 2010/54/EU of 20 August 2010 amending Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC to renew the inclusion of azimsulfuron as active substance (8) should be repealed.

amending Decision 2006/109/EC by accepting three offers to join the joint price undertaking accepted in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China
(2010/177/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 8 and 11(3) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). This Regulation was last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 500/2009 (3).
(2) The Commission, by Decision 2006/109/EC (4) accepted a joint price undertaking from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME) together with 20 cooperating Chinese companies or cooperating groups of companies. This Decision was amended by Commission Decision 2008/437/EC (5).
(3) The definitive Regulation gives the possibility to new Chinese exporting producers to be granted the same treatment as the cooperating companies in the original investigation, on the condition that these producers have been granted the new exporting producer treatment (NEPT) in accordance with Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005.
(4) Following three requests for NEPT based on Article 1(4) of the definitive Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 426/2008 (6) amended the definitive Regulation and assigned an individual duty rate of 28,6 % to the exporting producers HanDan County Yan Yuan Smelting and Casting Co., Ltd (HanDan), XianXian Guozhuang Precision Casting Co., Ltd (XianXian) and Wuxi Norlong Foundry Co., Ltd (Norlong).
(5) Following a request for NEPT based on Article 1(4) of the definitive Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 282/2009 (7) amended the definitive Regulation and assigned and individual duty rate of 28,6 % to the exporting producer Weifang Stable Casting Co., Ltd (Weifang).
(6) It is recalled that all four exporting producers received individual treatment (IT) during the NEPT investigation.
(7) Two of the four above-mentioned exporting producers granted NEPT (XianXian and Weifang) submitted together with the CCCME formal offers to join the joint liability undertaking accepted by the Commission.
(8) On 10 June 2009, the Commission, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (8), initiated a partial interim review of the definitive measures. The review is limited in scope to the examination of the form of the measures and in particular to the examination of the acceptability and workability of undertakings offered by exporting producers in the PRC.
(9) After the initiation of the partial interim review of the measures, yet another exporting producer granted NEPT, HanDan, submitted within the deadline, together with the CCCME a formal offer to join the joint liability undertaking accepted by the Commission.
(10) Another exporting producer granted NEPT, Norlong, submitted that it does not wish to adhere to the joint undertaking accepted by the Commission, but offered, within the deadline, a separate undertaking.
(11) On 15 December 2009, the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to accept the offers to join the joint price undertaking submitted by CCCME and HanDan, by CCCME and XianXian and by CCCME and Weifang and to reject the undertaking offered by Norlong were disclosed to interested parties. They were given the opportunity to comment. Their comments have been assessed before taking a final decision.
B.   UNDERTAKING OFFERS
(12) With regard to the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with Handan, XianXian and Weifang, it is noted that they are identical to the collective undertaking offer accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC and thus the CCCME and the three exporting producers undertake to ensure that the product concerned is exported at or above a minimum import price (MIP) set at a level that eliminates the injurious effect of dumping. It is recalled that the undertaking includes the indexation of the minimum import price of the product concerned in accordance with public international quotations for its main raw material, i.e. pig iron, given that casting prices vary significantly depending on the prices of pig iron.
(13) In addition, a further investigation showed that there are no company specific reasons that would call for a refusal of the offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan, XianXian and Weifang. In view of the foregoing, and as the companies received an individual duty rate, the Commission considers that it can accept the undertaking offer made by CCCME and the exporting producers.
(14) Moreover, the regular and detailed reports which the CCCME and the companies undertake to provide to the Commission will allow effective monitoring. It is, therefore, considered that the risk of circumventing the undertaking is limited.
(15) With regard to the separate undertaking offered by Norlong, it should be recalled that the original undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC was a joint liability undertaking of 20 companies together with the CCCME. The fact that it was offered as a joint undertaking contributed in a decisive manner to its acceptability by the Commission given that it increased the practicability and improved the control of the respect of the obligations deriving from the undertaking, all of this being necessary in view of the great number of exporting producers involved.
(16) Norlong argued that the Commission had already accepted in the past at least one individual undertaking from a company which had not been granted market economy treatment (MET) but only individual treatment (9), as is the case of Norlong. However, it should be emphasized that the situation in the case referred to by Norlong is different from the situation in the original undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC: in the case referred to by Norlong, only one undertaking offer of one exporting producer was finally accepted. It should also be recalled that that undertaking was subsequently withdrawn by the Commission because of numerous breaches found, including cross-compensation schemes (10).
(17) In the case of the undertaking accepted by Decision 2006/109/EC, the specificity of the situation, i.e. the great number of companies which exceeds 20, requires a particular set-up for a special control and monitoring. Norlong did not bring forward any relevant argument suggesting that it was in a different situation as the other companies part of the joint undertaking or justifying that the Commission should treat Norlong in a different way than the other companies that are part to the joint undertaking. Moreover, Norlong’s offer would imply a duplication of efforts of the Commission’s control and monitoring system. Since it would not be practicable and cost-effective for the Commission to control the respect of the obligations deriving from Norlong’s individual undertaking offer, the Commission considers that it cannot accept the separate undertaking offer made by Norlong.
(18) The Union industry objected to the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan, XianXian and Weifang, arguing that the MIP would be too low to protect the European industry from the effect of dumped imports and that the Union industry is suffering further injury. As regards the level of the MIP, it should be noted that anti-dumping duties were imposed at the level of the dumping margins found which were lower than the injury margins. Therefore, the MIP was also set on the normal value and thus eliminates merely the dumping established, in conformity with the principle of the lesser duty rule set out in Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation.
(19) The Union industry further argued that, despite the imposition of anti-dumping measures, the market share of Chinese exporters increased since the original investigation period (11). The Union industry claimed that this was due to an increase in exports from China combined with a sharp drop in Union consumption. However, no conclusive evidence with regard to the alleged sharp drop in consumption was submitted. Moreover, from the statistics available (12), it appears that dumped imports have decreased by 14 % since the original investigation period.
(20) In view of the above, none of the reasons put forward by the Union industry could alter the conclusion that the undertaking offer submitted by CCCME together with HanDan, Weifang and XianXian should be accepted.
(21) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the companies’ compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release into free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional upon (i) the presentation of an undertaking invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to Council Regulation (EC) No 268/2006 (13); (ii) the fact that imported goods are manufactured, shipped and invoiced directly by the said company to the first independent customer in the Union; and (iii) the fact that the goods declared and presented to customs correspond precisely to the description on the undertaking invoice. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty shall instead be payable.
(22) To further ensure the respect of the undertaking, importers have been made aware by Regulation (EC) No 268/2006 that the non-fulfilment of the conditions provided for by that Regulation, or the withdrawal by the Commission of the acceptance of the undertaking, may lead to a customs debt being incurred for the relevant transactions.

THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank, and in particular Article 28.5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Decision ECB/2013/28 of 29 August 2013 on the national central banks’ percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital (1) provides for the adjustment of the weightings assigned to the national central banks (NCBs) in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) capital (hereinafter the ‘capital key weightings’ and the ‘capital key’ respectively). This adjustment requires the Governing Council to determine the terms and conditions for transfers of capital shares between the NCBs that are members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) on 31 December 2013 in order to ensure that the distribution of these shares corresponds to the adjustments made. Accordingly, the adoption of a new decision is required that repeals Decision ECB/2013/18 of 21 June 2013 laying down the terms and conditions for transfers of the European Central Bank’s capital shares between the national central banks and for the adjustment of the paid-up capital (2) with effect from 1 January 2014.
(2) Decision ECB/2013/30 of 29 August 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (3) determines how and to what extent the NCBs of the Member States whose currency is the euro (hereinafter ‘euro area NCBs’) are under an obligation to pay up the ECB’s capital in view of the adjusted capital key. Decision ECB/2013/31 of 30 August 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the non-euro area national central banks (4) determines the percentage that the NCBs of the Member States whose currency is not the euro (hereinafter ‘non-euro area NCBs’) are under an obligation to pay up with effect from 1 January 2014 in view of the adjusted capital key.
(3) The euro area NCBs, with the exception of Latvijas Banka, have already paid up their shares in the ECB’s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2013/19 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (5). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/30 states that euro area NCBs should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/30.
(4) Furthermore, a separate decision of the Governing Council on the paying-up of capital, transfer of foreign reserve assets and contributions by Latvijas Banka to the European Central Bank’s reserves and provisions will lay down that Latvijas Banka, which will be a euro-area NCB from 1 January 2014, is under an obligation to pay up the remaining share of its subscription to the ECB’s capital in order to arrive at the amount shown next to its name in the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/30, taking into account the adjusted capital key.
(5) Likewise, the non-euro area NCBs have already paid up a percentage of their shares in the ECB’s subscribed capital as required under Decision ECB/2013/20 of 21 June 2013 on the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the non-euro area national central banks (6). In view of this, Article 2(1) of Decision ECB/2013/31 states that each of them should either transfer an additional amount to the ECB, or receive an amount back from the ECB, as appropriate, in order to arrive at the amounts shown in the third column of the table in Article 1 of Decision ECB/2013/31,","{'header': '21.1.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 16/55', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 29 August 2013\nlaying down the terms and conditions for transfers of the European Central Bank’s capital shares between the national central banks and for the adjustment of the paid-up capital\n(ECB/2013/29)\n(2014/31/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Decision ECB/2013/28 of 29 August 2013 on the national central banks’ percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital(1)provides for the adjustment of the weightings assigned to the national central banks (NCBs) in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) capital (hereinafter the ‘capital key weightings’ and the ‘capital key’ respectively).

Whereas:
(1) According to Commission Implementing Decision 2012/274/EU of 24 April 2012 determining the second set of regions for the start of operations of the Visa Information System (VIS) (2), the fourth region where the collection and transmission of data to the VIS for all applications should start comprises Benin, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Côte d’Ivoire, the Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo; and the fifth region comprises Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Rwanda and São Tomé and Principe.
(2) The Member States have notified the Commission that they have made the necessary technical and legal arrangements to collect and transmit the data referred to in Article 5(1) of the VIS Regulation to the VIS for all applications in those two regions, including arrangements for the collection and/or transmission of the data on behalf of another Member State.
(3) The condition laid down by the first sentence of Article 48(3) of the VIS Regulation thus being fulfilled, it is therefore necessary to determine the date from which the VIS is to start operations in a fourth and a fifth region.
(4) In view of the need to set the date for the start of the VIS in the very near future this Decision should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(5) Given that the VIS Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis, Denmark notified the implementation of the VIS Regulation in its national law in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community. Denmark is therefore bound under international law to implement this Decision.

Whereas:
(1) Negotiations with a view to adapting the trade agreement between the Community and Poland establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and the total liberalisation of trade in other agricultural products have recently been concluded. In the cereals sector, one of the new concessions provided for is the abolition of export refunds for malt.
(2) With a view to adopting this agreement, and in order to clarify the export terms at the beginning of April 2003 for all exporters in the cereals sector, in particular in view of the period of validity of export licences, those export refunds should be abolished from 1 April 2003.
(3) The authorities of Poland have undertaken to ensure that only consignments of Community products covered by the trade agreement on which no refund has been granted are allowed for import into that country. To that end, Article 7a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2305/2002(6), should apply to malt exports to Poland.
(4) It has been found that, in periods of increase in refund rates, the security of EUR 15 per tonne laid down in Article 10(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 is not sufficient to prevent large numbers of export licences in force for cereals and cereal products being returned to the issuing authorities. As such returns may generate problems in the administration of the exports, they should be discouraged by raising that security.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products (1), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3(2)(f) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (2) provides that European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) expenditure relating to fisheries markets is to be managed in a centralised manner.
(2) Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 specifies the types of expenditure that are incurred by the Member States.
(3) The financing of this expenditure follows the rules of centralised direct management between the Commission and the Member States.
(4) In order to ensure that Community funds are soundly managed and to protect the financial interests of the Community, Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 contains certain obligations for Member States concerning the management and control of these funds, as well as providing information regarding their legal and administrative framework for fulfilment of these obligations and to recover undue amounts if irregularities are detected in the management of these funds. Furthermore, the Communities' financial interests in relation to the expenditure financed under Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 are protected by the relevant rules pertaining to the protection of those interests in Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (3), Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) (4), Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities (5) and Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests (6).
(5) To ensure sound management of financial flows, in particular because the Member States themselves mobilise, in a first step, the funds to cover the expenditure referred to in Article 35 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 before the Commission reimburses their expenditure on a biannual basis, the Member States should collect the relevant information concerning the expenditure and transmit it to the Commission together with the declaration of expenditure.
(6) The Commission should reimburse Member States biannually on the basis of those declarations of expenditure and the supporting documents to that declaration.
(7) To enable the Commission to make efficient use of information from the Member States, that information should be sent electronically.
(8) To avoid the application of different exchange rates for aid paid to producer organisations in currencies other than the euro, on the one hand, and in the declaration of expenditure, on the other, Member States concerned should apply the same exchange rate in their declarations of expenditure as that used when making those payments to the beneficiaries. The exchange rates applicable must be laid down according to operative events as defined by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1925/2000 establishing the operative events for the exchange rates to be applied when calculating certain amounts provided for by the mechanisms of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (7).

This Decision provides for the opening of a new annual tariff quota for bananas originating in Mexico.
(3) In order to implement this tariff quota Regulation (EC) No 1362/2000 should be adjusted.

(4) In accordance with Decision No 2/2008 the new tariff quota should be open from 1 January to 31 December of each calendar year.

COUNCIL DECISION 2013/88/CFSP
of 18 February 2013
amending Decision 2010/800/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 29 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 2010/800/CFSP of 22 December 2010 concerning restrictive measures against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (1), and in particular Articles 10(1) and 12(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 22 December 2010, the Council adopted Decision 2010/800/CFSP.
(2) On 10 December 2012, the Council expressed its deep concern about the intent of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (the ""DPRK"") to launch a ""working satellite"", as such a launch makes use of ballistic missile technology, representing another clear violation of the DPRK's international obligations as set out in particular under United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution (UNSCR) 1695 (2006), UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009), and directly contravening the international community's unified call not to conduct such launches.
(3) On 22 January 2013, the UNSC adopted UNSCR 2087 (2013), condemning the DPRK's launch of 12 December 2012, which used ballistic missile technology and was in violation of UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009).
(4) On 12 February 2013, the DPRK carried out a nuclear test, in violation of its international obligations under UNSCR 1718 (2006), UNSCR 1874 (2009) and UNSCR 2087 (2013) and representing a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.
(5) Paragraph 5(a) of UNSCR 2087 (2013) provides that additional persons and entities are to be subject to restrictive measures.
(6) In addition, paragraph 5(b) of UNSCR 2087 (2013) establishes that the prohibition to supply, sell or transfer certain items, materials, equipment, goods and technology in accordance with paragraph 8(a)(ii) of UNSCR 1718 (2006) is also to apply to the items specified in paragraph 5(b) of UNSCR 2087 (2013).
(7) Paragraph 8 of UNSCR 2087 (2013) clarifies certain methods for States to dispose of items seized consistent with provisions of UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009) and in accordance with paragraph 14 of UNSCR 1874 (2009).
(8) Paragraph 12 of UNSCR 2087 (2013) also calls on States to exercise vigilance and restraint regarding the entry into or transit through their territories of individuals working on behalf or at the direction of designated individuals or entities.
(9) In line with paragraph 13 of UNSCR 2087 (2013), it is necessary to establish that no claims in connection with the performance of any contract or transaction affected by measures decided on pursuant to relevant UNSC resolutions or measures of the Union or any Member State in accordance with relevant decision of the UNSC or covered by this Decision, may be granted to designated persons or entities or any other person or entity in the DPRK.
(10) In accordance with the Council's conclusions on the DPRK of 10 December 2012, it is appropriate to adopt additional restrictive measures.
(11) An additional criterion for autonomous designation by the Union of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures should be included in Decision 2010/800/CFSP.
(12) The sale, supply or transfer to the DPRK of certain other goods relevant to the DPRK's weapons of mass destruction-related programmes, in particular its ballistic-missile sector, should be prohibited, especially certain types of aluminium.
(13) Furthermore, it should be clarified that where this decision provides for a prohibition on financial services, this includes the provision of insurance and re-insurance services.
(14) Moreover, the sale, purchase, transportation or brokering of gold, precious metals and diamonds to, from or for the Government of the DPRK should be prohibited.
(15) In addition, the delivery of newly printed or minted or unissued DPRK denominated banknotes and coinage to or for the benefit of the Central Bank of the DPRK should be prohibited.
(16) The sale or purchase of DPRK public or public-guaranteed bonds should be prohibited.
(17) Moreover, the opening of new branches, subsidiaries, or representative offices of DPRK banks in the territories of Member States, and the establishment of new joint ventures, or the taking of an ownership interest by the DPRK banks, including the Central Bank of DPRK, with banks within the jurisdiction of Member States, should be prohibited. Furthermore, Member States should take the appropriate measures to prohibit financial institutions within their territories or under their jurisdiction from opening representatives offices or subsidiaries in the DPRK.
(18) Following a decision by the UNSC Committee established pursuant to UNSCR 1718 (2006), six entities should be removed from the lists set out in Annexes II and III to Decision 2010/800/CFSP and should be added to the list set out in Annex I to that Decision. It is also necessary to amend the entries for those entities.
(19) Furthermore, in accordance with Article 12(3) of Decision 2010/800/CFSP, the Council has carried out a complete review of the list of other persons and entities set out in Annexes II and III to that Decision and has concluded that those persons and entities should continue to be subject to the appropriate restrictive measures provided for in that Decision.
(20) Decision 2010/800/CFSP should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '19.2.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 46/28', 'title': ""COUNCIL DECISION 2013/88/CFSP\nof 18 February 2013\namending Decision 2010/800/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 22 December 2010, the Council adopted Decision 2010/800/CFSP.\n\n((2)) On 10 December 2012, the Council expressed its deep concern about the intent of the Democratic People\'s Republic of Korea (the ""DPRK"") to launch a ""working satellite"", as such a launch makes use of ballistic missile technology, representing another clear violation of the DPRK\'s international obligations as set out in particular under United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution (UNSCR) 1695 (2006), UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009), and directly contravening the international community\'s unified call not to conduct such launches.\n\n((3)) On 22 January 2013, the UNSC adopted UNSCR 2087 (2013), condemning the DPRK\'s launch of 12 December 2012, which used ballistic missile technology and was in violation of UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009).\n\n((4)) On 12 February 2013, the DPRK carried out a nuclear test, in violation of its international obligations under UNSCR 1718 (2006), UNSCR 1874 (2009) and UNSCR 2087 (2013) and representing a serious threat to regional and international peace and security.\n\n((5)) Paragraph 5(a) of UNSCR 2087 (2013) provides that additional persons and entities are to be subject to restrictive measures.\n\n((6)) In addition, paragraph 5(b) of UNSCR 2087 (2013) establishes that the prohibition to supply, sell or transfer certain items, materials, equipment, goods and technology in accordance with paragraph 8(a)(ii) of UNSCR 1718 (2006) is also to apply to the items specified in paragraph 5(b) of UNSCR 2087 (2013).\n\n((7)) Paragraph 8 of UNSCR 2087 (2013) clarifies certain methods for States to dispose of items seized consistent with provisions of UNSCR 1718 (2006) and UNSCR 1874 (2009) and in accordance with paragraph 14 of UNSCR 1874 (2009).\n\n((8)) Paragraph 12 of UNSCR 2087 (2013) also calls on States to exercise vigilance and restraint regarding the entry into or transit through their territories of individuals working on behalf or at the direction of designated individuals or entities.\n\n((9)) In line with paragraph 13 of UNSCR 2087 (2013), it is necessary to establish that no claims in connection with the performance of any contract or transaction affected by measures decided on pursuant to relevant UNSC resolutions or measures of the Union or any Member State in accordance with relevant decision of the UNSC or covered by this Decision, may be granted to designated persons or entities or any other person or entity in the DPRK.\n\n((10)) In accordance with the Council\'s conclusions on the DPRK of 10 December 2012, it is appropriate to adopt additional restrictive measures.\n\n((11)) An additional criterion for autonomous designation by the Union of persons and entities subject to restrictive measures should be included in Decision 2010/800/CFSP.\n\n((12)) The sale, supply or transfer to the DPRK of certain other goods relevant to the DPRK\'s weapons of mass destruction-related programmes, in particular its ballistic-missile sector, should be prohibited, especially certain types of aluminium.\n\n((13)) Furthermore, it should be clarified that where this decision provides for a prohibition on financial services, this includes the provision of insurance and re-insurance services.\n\n((14)) Moreover, the sale, purchase, transportation or brokering of gold, precious metals and diamonds to, from or for the Government of the DPRK should be prohibited.\n\n((15)) In addition, the delivery of newly printed or minted or unissued DPRK denominated banknotes and coinage to or for the benefit of the Central Bank of the DPRK should be prohibited.\n\n((16)) The sale or purchase of DPRK public or public-guaranteed bonds should be prohibited.\n\n((17)) Moreover, the opening of new branches, subsidiaries, or representative offices of DPRK banks in the territories of Member States, and the establishment of new joint ventures, or the taking of an ownership interest by the DPRK banks, including the Central Bank of DPRK, with banks within the jurisdiction of Member States, should be prohibited.

It also provides that refund certificates applied for and, in some cases, refund certificates issued, are to be communicated to the Commission.
(2) Recent reductions in export refund rates, due to the combined effects of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and of the movements in agricultural commodity prices on the world market, have led to a situation in which less or no applications for refund certificates have been submitted, consequently easing the pressure on the Union budget for export refunds on goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty. In those circumstances where the Union is not in danger of breaching its international commitments, it is appropriate to simplify the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, therefore reducing the administrative burden.
(3) It is therefore appropriate to increase the payment threshold beneath which small exporters are exempted from submitting a refund certificate at individual and at global level. It is also appropriate to suspend the obligations for the competent authorities of the Member States to notify the amounts of refund certificates applied for where the refunds applicable to all the basic products are either suspended, not fixed or equal to zero, to notify certain refund certificates issued where no refund certificates were issued and, where no amounts are involved, the obligation to notify certain information for guaranteeing the functioning and the management of the refund certificate system and to inform the Commission that no amounts have been granted.

(1) A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (‘the Stabilisation and Association Agreement’), was signed in Luxembourg on 16 June 2008. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement is in the process of ratification.
(2) On 16 June 2008 an Interim Agreement was concluded on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (2) (‘the Interim Agreement’), which was approved by Council Decision 2008/474/EC (3). The Interim Agreement provides for the early entry into force of the trade and trade-related provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. It entered into force on 1 July 2008.
(3) The Interim Agreement and the Stabilisation and Association Agreement provide that certain fish and fishery products originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina may be imported into the European Union, within the limits of tariff quotas of the Union (‘quotas’), at a reduced or a zero rate of customs duty.
(4) The tariff quotas provided for in the Interim Agreement and in the Stabilisation and Association Agreement are annual and have been adopted for an indefinite period. It is necessary to open the tariff quotas for 2008 and following years and to provide for a common system for their management.
(5) This common management should ensure that all importers in the European Union have equal and continuous access to the tariff quotas and that the rates laid down for the quotas are applied uninterruptedly to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted. In order to ensure the efficiency of the system, Member States should be authorised to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. Close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission is required and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly. For reasons of speed and efficiency, communication between the Member States and the Commission should, as far as possible, take place by electronic transmission.
(6) The quotas opened by this Regulation should therefore be managed in accordance with the system for management of tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of acceptance of customs declarations which is provided for in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (4).
(7) As the Interim Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2008, this Regulation should apply from the same date and should remain in force after the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Customs Code Committee,","{'header': '13.4.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 98/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 354/2011\nof 12 April 2011\nopening and providing for the management of tariff quotas of the Union for certain fish and fishery products originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) A Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, of the other part (‘the Stabilisation and Association Agreement’), was signed in Luxembourg on 16 June 2008.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/119/EC(2), and in particular the third and the fourth subparagraphs of Article 8(2) thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), and in particular Article 7(3A)(b) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provided for the Commission to carry out a programme of work for the examination of the active substances used in plant protection products which were already on the market on 25 July 1993. Detailed rules for the carrying out of this programme were established in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member States for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), designated the active substances which should be assessed in the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, designated a Member State to act as rapporteur in respect of the assessment of each substance and identified the producers of each active substance who submitted a notification in due time.
(3) Atrazine is one of the 89 active substances designated in Regulation (EC) No 933/94.
(4) In accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, the United Kingdom, being the designated rapporteur Member State, submitted on 11 November 1996 to the Commission the report of its assessment of the information submitted by the notifiers in accordance with Article 6(1) of that Regulation.
(5) On receipt of the report of the rapporteur Member State, the Commission undertook consultations with experts of the Member States as well as with the main notifier Syngenta as provided for in Article 7(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(6) The Commission organised a tripartite meeting with the main data submitter and the rapporteur Member State for this active substance on 6 June 2003.
(7) The assessment report prepared by the United Kingdom has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. This review was finalised on 3 October 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for atrazine.
(8) The dossier and the information from the review were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants. The Committee was asked to comment on the aspects of possible contamination of groundwater by atrazine. In its opinion(7), the Scientific Committee on Plants did not accept the reported calculations of the environmental concentrations in groundwater. The Committee is also of the opinion that available monitoring data does not demonstrate that concentrations of atrazine or its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 μg/l in groundwater and it expects that for soils with pH above six concentrations of atrazine and its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 μg/l.
(9) Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing atrazine satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. In particular available monitoring data were insufficient to demonstrate that in large areas concentrations of the active substance and its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 μg/l in groundwater. Moreover it cannot be assured that continued use in other areas will permit a satisfactory recovery of groundwater quality where concentrations already exceed 0,1 μg/l in groundwater. These levels of the active substance exceed the limits in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC and would have an unacceptable effect on groundwater.
(10) Atrazine should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(11) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing atrazine are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(12) In the light of the information submitted to the Commission it appears that, in the absence of efficient alternatives for certain limited uses in certain Member States, there is a need for further use of the active substance so as to enable the development of alternatives. It is therefore justified in the present circumstances to prescribe, under strict conditions aimed at minimising risk, a longer period for the withdrawal of existing authorisations for the limited uses considered as essential for which no efficient alternatives appear currently to be available for the control of harmful organisms.
(13) Any period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing atrazine allowed by Member States, should be limited to a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing season.
(14) This Decision does not prejudice any action the Commission may undertake at a later stage for this active substance within the framework of Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances(8), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 807/2003(9).

Whereas, under Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70, only refunds on exports to third countries and intervention to stabilize agricultural markets, respectively granted and undertaken according to Community rules within the framework of the common organization of the agricultural markets, may be financed; whereas the inspections carried out show that a part of the expenditure declared by the Member States does not meet these conditions and therefore must be disallowed; whereas the amounts declared by each of the Member States concerned, those recognized as chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section and the difference between the two amounts and the difference between the expenditure recognized as chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section and that charged in respect of the year are shown in the Annex to this Decision;

Whereas the expenditure declared by Spain in respect of the olive-oil register, amounting to Pta 600 038 445, by France in respect of the cessation and reduction of milk production, amounting to FF 531 272 940,06, and by Italy for public storage of olive oil, amounting to Lit 142 558 268 250, is not covered by this Decision since further investigations are necessary; whereas, therefore, these amounts have been deducted from the expenditure declared by those Member States for 1993 and will be cleared later;
Whereas, before a financial correction that is eligible for the conciliation procedure set up by Commission Decision 94/442/EC (9) is fixed by the Commission, it is necessary that the Member State be given an opportunity, if it so wishes, of availing itself of that procedure, and should this occur, it is essential that the Commission study the report drawn up by the conciliation body; whereas the period set for the procedure will not have expired, in respect of all the eligible corrections, by the date of adoption of this Decision; whereas the clearance decision should not, however, be delayed further; whereas the corresponding amounts have therefore been deducted from the expenditure declared by the Member States concerned in respect of 1993 and will be cleared later;

Whereas the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 (2), decided that the Canary Islands should progressively become part of the Community's customs territory and that, again progressively, all common policies should be applied to them; whereas it was  decided that this should be without prejudice to special measures designed to take account of the specific constraints arising from their remoteness, insular nature and previous economic and tax arrangements;
Whereas, under Articles 2 and 10 of the abovementioned Regulation, application of the common agricultural policy is conditional on entry into force of specific supply arrangements; whereas application must moreover be accompanied by special measures for  the agricultural production of the Canary Islands;
Whereas the Council Decision 91/314/EEC of 26 June 1991 setting up a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary Islands (Poseican) (3) set out the general lines of the options to be exercised to take account of the  specific features and constraints encountered in the islands;
Whereas for the preparation and implementation of policy instruments a fuller picture is needed of the islands' market requirements, with due attention paid to local production and traditional trade flows, so that the most suitable measures can be  framed for supporting and improving agriculture in the islands, and in particular developing tropical products;
Whereas the measures must be drawn up within the framework of a partnership between the Commission and the national and regional authorities in order to secure complementarity with measures implemented at national and regional level;
Whereas owing to the complexity of the preparatory work needed in order to take due account of the specific features and constraints as mentioned above and to the requirements involved in the partnership it will not be possible to apply from 1 January  1992 the measures that are to accompany introduction of the common agricultural policy to the islands; whereas application should be deferred to at the latest 1 July 1992;
Whereas it should be recalled that until entry into force of the specific supply arrangements the provisions of the Act of Accession on application of the common agricultural policy to the Canary Islands shall apply, except for those governing access of  products originating in the islands to other parts of the Community,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 284/92 of 3 February 1992 amending, as regards the common agricultural policy, Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nIn the second sentence of Article 10 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 the date of '1 January 1992' shall be replaced by that of '1 July 1992'.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1992.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the provisions of Articles 92, 92A and 119 of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders (the 1990 Schengen Convention) (1),
Whereas:
(1) The 1990 Schengen Convention provides that the costs arising from the installation and operation of C.SIS, including the cost of the wide-area network, and its encryption, connecting the national sections of the Schengen Information System (SIS) to the C.SIS shall be borne jointly by the Contracting Parties.
(2) The financial obligations arising from the installation and operation of the C.SIS are regulated by a specific Financial Regulation, as amended by the Decision of the Schengen Executive Committee of 15 December 1997 amending the Financial Regulation on C.SIS (2) (hereinafter the ‘C.SIS Financial Regulation’).
(3) As regards the communication infrastructure for the Schengen environment, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Council was authorised by Decision 1999/870/EC (3) and Decision 2007/149/EC (4) to act, in the context of the integration of the Schengen acquis within the European Union, as the representative of certain Member States for the purposes of concluding and managing contracts relating to the installation and the functioning of the communication infrastructure for the Schengen environment, ‘SISNET’ pending its migration to a communication infrastructure under the responsibility of the European Union.

(6) The management by the same entity of the technical support function and of the wide-area network, including encryption, connecting it to the national sections of the SIS, including all the financial obligations stemming from their installation and operation, should make proceedings smooth, ensuring synergies and saving efforts.
(7) The technical support function is currently managing the encryption of the network connecting the national sections to the technical support function.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3805/85 (2), and in particular Articles 14a (4) and 65 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3),
Having regard to the Council Regulation (EEC) No 1678/85 of 11 June 1985 fixing the conversion rates to be applied in agriculture (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2332/86 (5),
Whereas, under the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) fo Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, an aid system was introduced for the use of grape musts and concentrated grape musts produced in wine-growing zones C III (a) and C III (b) for the preparation in the United Kingdom and Ireland of certain products, falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff and for the use of concentrated grape musts produced in the Community for the manufacture of certain products marketed in the United Kingdom and in Ireland with instructions for obtaining from them a beverage in imitation of wine;
Whereas the products falling within heading No 22.07 of the Common Customs Tariff referred to in the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of the abovementioned Regulation are at the moment produced exclusively from concentrated grape must; whereas, at present, aid should therefore be fixed for the use of concentrated grape must alone;
Whereas implementation of the aid system requires administrative arrangements for checking both the origin of the products for which aid is given and the use to which they are put;
Whereas, to ensure that the aid system and the controls operate properly, operators concerned must be required to submit written applications giving the information necessary to identify the product and enable the operations to be checked;
Whereas, so that the aid system can have an appreciable effect on the quantity of Community products used, a minimum quantity for which applications may be submitted should be fixed;
Whereas it should also be stated that aid will be granted only for products having the minimum quality characteristics required for use for the purposes indicated in the second and third indents of the first subparagraph of Article 14a (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79;
Whereas Article 14a (3) of that Regulation sets criteria for fixing the aid; whereas application of those criteria gives the aid amounts fixed below;
Whereas, to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to make the necessary checks, obligations on operators in regard to the keeping of stock records should be laid down in addition to the provisions of Title II of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1153/75 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3203/80 (7);
Whereas it should be laid down that entitlement to aid is established at the moment when the processing operations are completed; whereas, to allow for technical losses, the quantity actually used should be allowed to be up to 10 % less than that shown in the application;
Whereas for technical reasons operators lay in their stocks a long time before manufacturing the marketed products; whereas arrangements should accordingly be made to enable advance payment of the aid to be made to operators, the competent authorities being guaranteed by an appropriate security against the risk of incorrect payment; whereas the period within which advance payment is to be made and the procedure for release of the security should be specified;

(1) By its decision of 19 December 2002(3) and its decision of 19 December 2002(4), the Council approved the conclusion of Agreements in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Community and the United States of America, and the European Community and Canada, respectively relating to the modification of concessions with respect to cereals provided for in schedule CXL annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Agreements amend the conditions for importing barley and medium and low quality common wheat by fixing import quotas for these products from 1 January 2003.
(2) By the above decisions the Council authorised the Commission to derogate temporarily for these products from the system of import duties provided for in Article 10(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 pending approval of a formal amendment of that Regulation. To allow the Agreements approved by the Council to be implemented in full, the rules of application should also be adapted temporarily as regards the import duties in the cereals sector laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1249/96(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1900/2002(6).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1287/95(2), and in particular Article 5(2)(c) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(3), and in particular Article 7(4) thereof,
After consulting the Committee for the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Article 7(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 stipulate that the Commission is to exclude expenditure from Community financing where it finds that it has not been incurred in accordance with Community rules.
(2) The above Articles of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 as well as Article 8(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1663/95 of 7 July 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 regarding the procedure for the clearance of the accounts of the EAGGF Guarantee Section(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2025/2001(5), provide that the Commission is to carry out the necessary checks, forward its findings to the Member States, consider any comments from the latter, enter into bilateral discussions to reach an agreement with the Member States concerned and formally communicate its conclusions to them, referring to Commission Decision 94/442/EC of 1 July 1994 setting up a conciliation procedure in the context of the clearance of the accounts of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) Guarantee Section(6), as last amended by Decision 2001/535/EC(7).
(3) The Member States have had the opportunity to request that a conciliation procedure be initiated. That procedure has been applied in some cases and the reports issued on the outcome have been considered by the Commission.
(4) Articles 2 and 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 provide that refunds on exports to third countries and intervention intended to stabilise agricultural markets may be financed only where they are either granted or undertaken in accordance with the Community rules governing the common organisations of agricultural markets.
(5) The findings of checks performed, the results of bilateral discussions and the outcome of the conciliation procedures have shown that some expenditure declared by the Member States does not meet those conditions and cannot therefore be financed under the EAGGF Guarantee Section.
(6) The Annex to this Decision sets out the amounts that are not recognised as being chargeable to the EAGGF Guarantee Section. Those amounts do not relate to expenditure incurred more than 24 months before the Commission's written notification of the results of the checks to the Member States.
(7) As regards the cases covered by this Decision, the assessment of the amounts to be excluded on grounds of non-compliance with Community rules was notified by the Commission to the Member States and is set out in a summary report on the subject.
(8) This Decision is without prejudice to any financial conclusions that the Commission may draw from the judgments of the Court of Justice in cases pending on 30 April 2003 and relating to its content,","{'title': '2003/536/EC: Commission Decision of 22 July 2003 excluding from Community financing certain expenditure incurred by the Member States under the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) (notified under document number C(2003) 2587)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe expenditure itemised in the Annex hereto that has been incurred by the Member States' accredited paying agencies and declared under the EAGGF Guarantee Section is hereby excluded from Community financing because it does not comply with Community rules.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Hellenic Republic, the French Republic and the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 22 July 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 13.\n\n(2) OJ L 125, 8.6.1995, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 160, 26.6.1999, p. 103.\n\n(4) OJ L 158, 8.7.1995, p. 6.\n\n(5) OJ L 274, 17.10.2001, p. 3.\n\n(6) OJ L 182, 16.7.1994, p. 45.\n\n(7) OJ L 193, 17.7.2001, p. 25.\n\nANNEX\n\nTotal corrections\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

(2) The increase of the ceiling for subheading 1a for the year 2010 will be fully offset by decreasing the ceilings for commitment appropriations under headings 1a, 1b, 2, 3a and 5 for the year 2009 as well as the ceilings for commitment appropriations under headings 1a, 2 and 5 for 2010.
(3) In order to keep an appropriate relationship between commitments and payments, the annual ceilings for payment appropriations will be adjusted. The adjustment will be neutral.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 17 of 6 February 1962, First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty (1), as last amended by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 6 and 8 thereof,
Having regard to the notification and application for negative clearance submitted on 23 December 1988 by Fiat Geotech Technolgie per la Terra SpA and Hitachi Construction Machinery Ltd concerning a joint venture, as well as the amendment thereto  submitted on 12 June 1992,
Having regard to the summary of the notification published (2) pursuant to Article 19 (3) of Regulation No 17,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
I. THE FACTS
(1) On 23 December 1988 the Commission was requested to give negative clearance for, or, alternatively, to exempt pursuant to Article 85 (3), a joint venture for the manufacture, distribution and sale of hydraulic excavators and related products.
The parties
(2) The notifying parties are Fiat Geotech Tecnologie per la Terra SpA (Fiat) and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd (Hitachi). Fiat is a subsidiary of Fiat SpA of Turin. Hitachi is a subsidiary of Hitachi Limited of Japan.
The product and market
(3) The principal product involved is hydraulic excavators of between 10,5 and 45 tonnes. These are medium to large excavators used mainly in road construction, large public works contracts and in mines and quarries.
(4) Such excavators form part of the wider earthmoving machinery market which includes six other types of equipment (wheel loaders, crawler loaders, backhoe loaders, dozers, graders and scrapers). They are sold throughout the world, and although there  are local markets, the more important customers which, however, represent only 10 % of the market, are international contracting firms that may buy anywhere in the world for use anywhere in the world.
(5) After the worldwide recession in the early 1980s, when there was a drop in demand of about 35 %, the earthmoving machinery market seems to be on a slight rise or, at least, to have stabilized. Market changes have, however, influenced the structure  of producers operating throughout the sector, which means that some companies have left the sector, joint ventures and mergers have been entered into to cope with new market conditions, certain plants of companies still in business following the setting  up of joint ventures have been closed down and some producers have acquired plants abroad in order to be present directly in strategic markets. Within the Community the 8 largest manufacturers have 72 % of the market; the market leader has about 18 %.  Fiat is in fifth place while Hitachi is not a full-line producer present in all product lines.
(6) Analysis of the earthmoving machinery market structure shows up separate subsectors which have, to some extent, developed differently over recent years. As regards the hydraulic excavator subsector in particular, it has grown as a percentage of  machines produced in the entire sector. Although the number of units sold show a decline, the sales of such excavators have held up relatively well compared with the sales of other types of earthmoving machinery.
(7) The Community market is second in the world for excavators (with approximately 20 % of world sales) after the Japanese market; about 15 % of the excavators sold in the Community are produced outside.
(8) There are many producers of hydraulic excavators. Within the Community the 8 largest manufacturers have 75 % of the market. The market leader has nearly 15 %. Fiat, having sixth place within the Community, has a very uneven penetration with a large  share above all in Italy, followed by Spain and France, and little elsewhere. Hitachi is in eighth place, and has a substantial presence only in the United Kingdom, Ireland and The Netherlands. Fiat and Hitachi combined had fourth place with about 12 %  of the market, which tey expect to rise to some [. . .] % (3) following the creation of the joint venture. There are many smaller producers, most of them operating on a local basis, with about 15 % of the market. At present European manufacturers  produce small quantities using components bought in from other suppliers. Even leading European manufacturers rely primarily on external suppliers for components. This is due to low output, as well as to the characteristics of the product and the  manufacturers is based not su much on product innovation and price as on product diversification between manufacturers, who cater for the specific market requirements in their own main countries or areas of operation.
(9) The joint venture also makes hydraulic calinders, which are used as components of hydraulic excavators, but also of other earthmoving machinery, either for incorporation in the joint venture's principal products or for sale. In addition, the  arrangements concern the purchase of parts for incorporation in and the sale of spare parts for the principal product, and may involve the manufacture and/or distribution of other earthmoving or construction machinery. Many of the parts or components  used in excavators, for example the motors, are also used in a wide variety of other products.
The arrangements
(10) The notified agreements provide for the formation of a joint venture company called Fiat-Hitachi Excavators SpA (Fiat-Hitachi), based in Italy. It began trading by taking over the existing Fiat range of excavators and cylinders, but developed a new  Fiat-Hitachi range using Hitachi technology. The joint venture also organized the integration of the marketing structures and networks of Fiat and Hitachi in the countries indicated as exclusive joint-venture countries.
(11) The joint venture has an exclusive market covering Western Europe (including the whole of the Community), the Mediterranean basin and Africa. It has non-exclusive access to the USA (where Hitachi has a joint venture with Deere) and the former  Comecon countries. It has no access to the rest of the world which is the exclusive territory of Hitachi (other than for the right of Fiat to continue to produce and sell its non-Hitachi design excavators through Fiatallis Latino-Americana).
(12) Both Fiat and Hitachi license their relevant technology to the joint venture. The Fiat licence makes Fiat Hitachi joint owners of the technology with Fiat. The Hitachi licence is exclusive for the joint venture's exclusive market, and non-exclusive  elsewhere. These licences are perpetual and irrevocable.
(13) After discussion with the services of the Commission, the parties have undertaken that, in so far as the Community is concerned, the agreements allow passive sales into the other's exclusive territory. This undertaking has been incorporated into  the agreements. This means, in so far as the Community is concerned, that although Hitachi will not seek to sell to Community-based contractors or other undertakings, it will accept orders coming from such purchasers.
(14) The arrangements provide for the joint venture to buy all its motors from Iveco (which is part of the Fiat group) and all hydraulics which it does not manufacture itself from Hitachi.
(15) The two parent companies undertake that should they decide to manufacture and/or sell, on the joint venture's exclusive market any type of earthmoving machinery not then manufactured or marketed, each of them grant to the other first refusal right  to realize such initiative together for the manufacture of such products through Fiat-Hitachi or by some other form of cooperation.
(16) The arrangements include a minority participation by the Sumitomo Corporation in the joint venture. They also include provisions for the joint venture to buy plant, materials and components through Sumitomo, but at the joint venture's option rather  than exclusively.
(17) The term of the joint venture runs until 2001, and is renewable. The various exclusivities remain in force until the end of that year.
The parties' submissions
(18) The parties ask for negative clearance claiming that, as Fiat is withdrawing from the market, Fiat and Hitachi are no longer competitors.
(19) Alternatively, the parties ask for an exemption under Article 85 (3). They argue that:
-  the agreements will lead to technologically-advanced products,
- distribution and after-sales service will be improved,
- the market share of the joint venture for 1988 is estimated at only some [. . .] % in the Community as a whole,
- the agreements will, therefore, result in benefits for the consumer in terms of price, quality and reliability,
- all the potentially restrictive provisions of the agreements are indispensable to achieving the objectives; in particular, the joint venture will be free to use all technology after the expiry of the relevant licences.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
Article 85
(1)
(20) The creation of the joint venture Fiat-Hitachi does not constitute a concentration within the meaning of Article 3 (2), second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between  undertakings (4). Fiat and Hitachi were actual competitors in Europe and worldwide before they entered into the agreement to create their joint venture. They have remained at least potential competitors thereafter. Hitachi operates on the same product  markets as Fiat-Hitachi in Japan and in the Far East and indirectly, through its joint venture with Deere, also in the USA. Fiat continues to develop, manufacture and sell its product range based on its own technology through Fiatallis Latino-Americana  and to operate in the other subsectors of the earthmoving machinery market. Both parent companies have retained their technolgies for the production of hydraulic excavators and components and merely granted a licence to their joint venture and the  relevant agreements are to terminate in the event of liquidation of the joint venture. As exclusive suppliers of motors and hydraulics, they are furthermore actively interested in the production and marketing acitivities of Fiat-Hitachi. Under these  circumstances, the joint venture has to be qualified as cooperative in nature. Its creation would have led to coordination of competitive behaviour between the parent companies, on the one hand, and between the parent companies and the joint venture on  the other hand, even if the parties had not included restrictive clauses in their contractual arrangements.
(21) The parties have put together their European hydraulic excavator manufacturing and distribution activities. By agreeing not to compete with their joint venture, they have furthermore excluded any competition with each other and with the joint  venture in the latter's contractual territory.
(22) The agreement gives Fiat-Hitachi an exclusive territory covering the whole of the Community, while excluding it from Hitachi'y home market, Japan, and from the Far East. This constitutes a ban on active imports by Hitachi into the Community.
(23) The creation of the joint venture is expected to give Fiat and Hitachi a captive market for components for 16 % of the excavators sold within the Community.
(24) These provisions in the agreements will have as their object or effect to appreciably restrict competition within the meaning of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty.
Article 85
(3)
(25) The joint venture will develop better excavators than were currently being produced by Fiat and Hitachi separately, as each party will incorporate technically better components at its disposal. In addition, the merging of the separate and largely  complementary distribution systems of Fiat and Hitachi improves the distribution of the resulting product.
(26) The joint venture is expected to have 16 % of the Community market for excavators. This will not give it a dominant position in this market. Moreover, it should be more effective than either Fiat and Hitachi separately, and, therefore, the creation  of the joint venture will bring about a more balanced market structure and the joint venture will in future operate throughout the Community. In consequence, the pruchasers of tractors should also benefit from the improvements in the products and of  their distribution.
(27) Although the exclusive purchasing provisions, described in recital 14, foreclose sales opportunities for third party manufacturers of motors and hydraulics, this restriction results from the setting up of the joint venture and appears to be  reasonably necessary to its operation. In addition to that, the restriction will not have the effect of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products in question. In effect, even if third party manufacturers were to offer  terms such that, in the absence of such provisions, the joint venture might be led to purchase from them rather than from its parent companies, these manufacturers will still have access to a large market comprising not only other manufacturers of  hydraulic excavators but also manufacturers of the wide variety of products in which such motors and hydraulics are incorporated.
(28) With the undertaking referred to in recital 13, the provisions on distribution as described above also appear to be no more than is necessary to allow the joint venture to function.
(29) The notified agreements therefore meet the requirements for exemption pursuant to Article 85 (3).
(30) The agreements will continue in force in their present form until the end of 2001. They were notified to the Commission on 23 December 1988. It appears appropriate therefore, pursuant to Articles 6 (1) and 8 (1) of Regulation No 17, to grant such  an exemption for a period of 13 years with effect from that date,","{'title': '93/48/EEC: Commission Decision of 21 December 1992 relating to a proceeding pursuant to Article 85 of the EEC Treaty (IV/33.031 - Fiat/Hitachi) (Only the English and Italian texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '85', 'title': 'Article 85', 'text': ""Article 85\n\n(1)\n\n(20) The creation of the joint venture Fiat-Hitachi does not constitute a concentration within the meaning of Article 3 (2), second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between  undertakings (4).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 131 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 has taken over the restrictions previously laid down in Council Directive 76/769/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (2). In entry 6, paragraph 1, of Annex XVII to that Regulation, the term ‘product’, used in the original restriction on asbestos in Directive 76/769/EEC, was replaced by ‘article’ which does not cover mixtures. In order for entry 6, paragraph 1, to cover the same items as that Directive, the term ‘mixtures’ should be added.
(2) The derogations in entries 16 and 17 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 as regards the use of lead carbonates and lead sulphates in paints for the restoration and maintenance of works of art and historic buildings and their interiors should apply not only to the use but also to the placing on the market in order to allow those paints to be available for restoration and maintenance works as well.
(3) The restriction in entries 28, 29 and 30 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 makes reference to a specific concentration limit laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 (3) and to a concentration limit specified in Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (4) that are applied in order to determine whether a substance or mixture is covered by that restriction. It should be clarified that the concentration limit specified in Directive 1999/45/EC applies only where a specific concentration limit is not set out in Part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.
(4) Commission Regulation (EU) No 519/2012 of 19 June 2012 amending Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants as regards Annex I (5) added short-chain chlorinated paraffins (hereinafter ‘SCCPs’) to Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on persistent organic pollutants and amending Directive 79/117/EEC (6). Production, placing on the market and use of SCCPs is therefore prohibited, subject to certain specific exemptions. Entry 42 in Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, which restricts two uses of SCCPs that are now banned under Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 has become superfluous and should therefore be deleted.
(5) A harmonised testing method adopted by the European Committee for Standardization for determining the water soluble chromium VI content of cement in accordance with Directive 2003/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2003 amending for the 26th time Council Directive 76/769/EEC relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (nonylphenol, nonylphenol ethoxylate and cement) (7) should be used. For the purpose of clarity, entry 47 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should contain a reference to that testing method.
(6) The substance methylenediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) in entry 56 of Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, identified by CAS number 26447-40-5 and EC number 247-714-0, encompasses all isomeric mixtures and all specific isomers. However, certain specific isomers have specific CAS or EC numbers. In order to clarify that all isomers are covered, three specific CAS and EC numbers should be added.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 552/2009 of 22 June 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards Annex XVII (8) deleted notes E, H and S from the foreword to Appendices 1 to 6 to Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, as well as from the Appendices 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6. For reasons of coherence, the notes E, H and S should be deleted also from Appendix 4.
(8) The entry on diisopentylphthalate in Appendix 6 to Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 indicates incorrect EC and CAS numbers, which should be corrected.
(9) New standards concerning the testing methods for azocolourants and azodyes have been adopted by the European Committee for Standardization. It is therefore necessary to update Appendix 10 to Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 to take account of those standards.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6 (2) of Directive 91/414/EEC Germany received on 8 June 2001 an application from BASF AG for the inclusion of the active substance tritosulfuron in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2002/268/EC (2) confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(2) For this active substance, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 5 September 2002.
(3) For tritosulfuron the draft assessment reports were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 20 May 2008 in the format of the Commission review report for tritosulfuron.
(4) The documents and information on tritosulfuron were also submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for separate consultation. The EFSA was invited to prepare a scientific opinion on the toxicological relevance of the soil and groundwater metabolite TBSA of tritosulfuron in the context of the human risk assessment. The EFSA was asked whether, on the basis of the data available, the metabolite TBSA shows a genotoxic potential or an indication of impaired fertility and what are the implications for toxicological reference values for humans.
(5) In its opinion of 11 December 2007 (3), the EFSA concluded that TBSA did not show any clastogenic or other genotoxic potential and has no direct effect on fertility and that therefore there is no requirement for any adjustment of the default safety factor for potential effect on fertility. That opinion was taken into account.
(6) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to include tritosulfuron in Annex I to that Directive, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing these active substances may be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive.
(7) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Directive 91/414/EEC as a consequence of including an active substance in Annex I, Member States should be allowed a period of six months after inclusion to review existing provisional authorisations of plant protection products containing tritosulfuron to ensure that the requirements laid down by Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular in its Article 13 and the relevant conditions set out in Annex I, are satisfied. Member States should transform existing provisional authorisations into full authorisations, amend them or withdraw them in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC. By derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURES
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems (‘TCS’) originating in Japan.
(2) In Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation No 1015/94, the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty camera systems listed in the Annex to that Regulation (‘the Annex’), representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94, but which cannot be regarded as television camera systems.
(3) In October 1995, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2474/95 (3), amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94, in particular as regards the definition of the like product and certain models of professional camera systems which were explicitly exempted from the definitive anti-dumping duty.
(4) In October 1997, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1952/97 (4), amended the rates of the definitive anti-dumping duty for two companies concerned, namely for Sony Corporation and Ikegami Tsushinki Co. Ltd pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation. Furthermore, the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty certain new models of professional camera systems by adding them to the Annex.
(5) In January 1999 and January 2000, the Council, by Regulations (EC) No 193/1999 (5) and (EC) No 176/2000 (6), amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex and thus excluding those from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty. In October 2004, the Council, by Regulation (EC) 1754/2004 (7), amended Regulation (EC) No 176/2000.
(6) In September 2000, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 (8), confirmed the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 pursuant to Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.
(7) In January 2001 and in May 2001, the Council, by Regulations (EC) No 198/2001 (9) and (EC) No 951/2001 (10), amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty.
(8) In September 2001, further to an interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1900/2001 (11) confirmed the level of the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 on imports of TCS from the exporting producer Hitachi Denshi Ltd.
(9) In September 2002, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1696/2002 (12), amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty.
(10) In April 2004, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 825/2004, amended Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 by adding certain successor models of professional camera systems to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus excluding them from the application of the definitive anti-dumping duty.
B.   INVESTIGATION CONCERNING NEW MODELS OF PROFESSIONAL CAMERA SYSTEMS
1.   Procedure
(11) Two Japanese exporting producers, namely Sony Corporation (‘Sony’) and Victor Company of Japan Limited (‘JVC’) informed the Commission that they intended to introduce new models of professional camera systems into the Community market and requested the Commission to add these new models of professional camera systems, including their accessories, to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 and thus exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties.
(12) The Commission informed the Community industry accordingly and commenced an investigation limited to the determination of whether the products under consideration fall within the scope of the anti-dumping duties and whether the operational part of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly.
2.   Models under investigation
(13) The requests for exemption were received for the following models of camera systems, supplied with the relevant technical information:
(i) Sony:
— viewfinder HDVF-C30W
(ii) JVC:
— Camera head KY-F560E
3.   Findings
(i)   Viewfinder HDVF-C30W
(14) It was found that viewfinder HDVF-C30W falls under the product description of Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. However, it can only be used with camera heads that do not fall under the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of that Regulation. In particular, the signal-to-noise ratio of these camera heads is 54 dB, whereas the description in Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 for the camera heads requires ‘55 dB or more at normal gain’. Therefore, it was concluded that this viewfinder should be regarded as a professional camera system falling within the definition of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. As a result, this viewfinder should be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000.
(15) In accordance with the established Community Institutions' practice, this model should be exempted from the duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of Sony-Viewfinder HDVF-C30W imported on or after 1 April 2003 should be exempted from the duty from this date.
(ii)   Camera head KY-F560E
(16) It was found that camera head KY-F560E, although falling within the product description of Article 1(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000, is mainly used in technical and medical applications. It was therefore concluded that this model was to be regarded as a professional camera system falling within the definition of Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000. It should therefore be excluded from the scope of the existing anti-dumping measures and added to the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000.
(17) In accordance with the established Community Institutions’ practice, this model should be exempted from the duty from the date of receipt by the Commission services of the relevant request for exemption. Therefore, all imports of JVC-Camera head KY-F560E imported on or after 15 April 2004 should be exempted from the duty from this date.
4.   Information of the interested parties and conclusions
(18) The Commission informed the Community industry and the exporters of the TCS of its findings and provided them with an opportunity to present their views. None of the parties objected to the Commission's findings.
(19) On the basis of the foregoing, Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 should be amended accordingly,","{'header': '21.1.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 19/9', 'title': 'COUNCIL

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1929/92  of 10 July 1992  opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for rum, tafia and arrack originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States (1992 to 1993)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the Fourth ACP-EEC Convention entered into force on 1 September 1991 (1);
Whereas Protocol 6 to that Convention provides that products originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States which fall within CN codes 2208 40 10, 2208 40 90, 2208 90 11 and 2208 90 19 shall, until the entry into force of a common  organization of the market in spirits, be allowed into the Community free of customs duties under conditions such as to permit the development of traditional trade flows between the ACP States and the Community and between the Member States; whereas the  Community shall until 31 December 1993 fix each year the quantities which may be imported free of customs duties on the basis of the largest quantities imported annually from the ACP States into the Community in the past three years for which statistics  are available, increased, until 31 December 1992, by an annual growth rate of 37 % on the market of the United Kingdom and 27 % on the other markets of the Community;
Whereas, by virtue of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1820/87 of 25 June 1987 concerning the application of Decision No 2/87 of the ACP-EEC Council of Ministers on the advance implementation of the Protocol to the Third ACP-EEC Convention consequent on the  Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the European Communities (2), provision is made for special arrangements for the quota duties to be applied by those two Member States until 31 December 1992;
Whereas those two Member States will apply the quota duty indicated in Article 1 as from 1 January 1993; whereas, by reason of the characteristics peculiar to the market in rum, the quota period ranges from 1 July to 30 June;
Whereas, having regard to the levels reached by imports of the products concerned into the Community during the past three years for which statistics are available, the annual quota volume for the period from 1 July 1992 to 30 June 1993 must be fixed at  214 268 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas although this volume is calculated on the basis of the reference year 1991, that is, for an amount of 184 402 hectolitres of pure alcohol, it is appropriate for reasons inherent in the rum market to take only the second six months of 1991 as a  basis for calculating the specific growth rates applicable until 31 December 1992, namely, 104 111 hectolitres of pure alcohol, 17 562 hectolitres of which were imported by the United Kingdom and 86 549 hectolitres by the other Member States; whereas  the quota volume for the second six months of 1992 must accordingly be fixed at 133 977 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas the quota volume calculated for the first six months of 1993 should not be increased but should be fixed at the same amount as applied in the last corresponding quota period for which statistics are available, that is the first six months of  1991, for which the amount is 80 291 hectolitres of pure alcohol;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all  Member States until the quota has been used up;
Whereas, following the case-law of the Court of Justice, it is unlawful to allocate the Community quotas between the Member States, unless overriding circumstances of an administrative, technical or economic nature prevent acting otherwise; whereas, in  addition, in cases where it is decided to allocate quotas, a mechanism should be set up whereby the integrity of the Common Customs Tariff may be protected;
Whereas the economic difficulties which could result for the French overseas departments (FOD) from the sudden change in the arrangements for importing rum from the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States constitute circumstances having a binding  effect which justify the temporary and partial maintenance of these arrangements; whereas, however, the arrangements for allocation of the quota into national shares should be phased out, being justified only on a transitional basis, and whereas they  should in any event definitively disappear as from 1 January 1993;
Whereas, in these circumstances, it is advisable to increase to 80 % the volume of the Community reserve by means of a system for the automatic transfer of Member State share to the reserve as soon as 80 % of the latter has been used up; whereas any  quantities allocated to Member States from the quota volume which have not been used up by 1 January 1993 should also be returned to the reserve;
Whereas, during the past three years for which statistical data are available, imports from Member States have been as follows:
(in hectolitres of pure alcohol)
Member State  1989  1990  1991       Benelux  7 621  9 339  13 229  Denmark  1 748  2 404  1 602  Germany  48 591  50 451  62 242  Greece  586  5 699  6 014  Spain  156  9 514  22 916  France  19  -  -  Ireland  2 973  2 282  2 783  Italy   431  54  9 947  Portugal  -  -  124  United Kingdom  83 773  70 436  65 545       Total  145 898  150 179  184 402
Whereas, in view of these factors, of market forecasts for the products in question and of the estimates submitted by certain  Member States, quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:
Benelux 6,30
Denmark 1,20
Germany 33,56
Greece 2,55
Spain 6,80
France -
Ireland 1,68
Italy 2,18
Portugal -
United Kingdom 45,73;
Whereas provision should be made for a mechanism to prevent, when the Community quota is not exhausted, goods from being imported into a Member State which has exhausted its share only after the full application of customs duties, or after having been  diverted to another Member State which has not yet exhausted its share; whereas, in these circumstances, if, during the period from 1 July to 31 December 1992, the Community reserve were to be almost entirely used up, Member States should return to the  said reserve all of the unused portion of their initial shares so as to avoid part of the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State, when it could be used in others;
Whereas measures should be laid down to ensure that Protocol 6 is implemented under conditions such as to permit the development of traditional trade flows between the ACP States and the Community, on the one hand, and between the Member States on the  other;
Whereas this form of administration requires close collaboration between the Member States and the Commission, and the Commission must be able to keep account of quota utilization rates and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of the quotas may be carried out  by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1929/92 of 10 July 1992 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for rum, tafia and arrack originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States (1992 to 1993)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

'. . .
At the end of 1987 the cost of living in Munich was 8,3 % higher than in Bonn - the capital at that time - and that, in the absence of a specific weighting, such a significant difference reduced the purchasing power of officials serving in Munich in  comparison with that of their colleagues serving in Bonn.
In particular, in view of the wide discrepancy found in this case, the obligation to establish a specific weighting could not depend on the number of officials and other servants of the Communities concerned.

Whereas, by letter dated 24 April 1968, the Government of the Polish People's Republic stated that it was prepared to give such guarantee for exports to the Community of live swine and pig carcases ; whereas it will ensure that such exports are made only by the State foreign trade agency Animex ; whereas it will ensure also that deliveries of the above-mentioned products are not made at free-at-Community-frontier prices lower than the sluice-gate prices valid on the day of customs clearance ; whereas, to that end, it will see to it in particular that the State foreign trade agency Animex does not take any action which might indirectly bring about prices lower than the sluice-gate prices, such as taking over marketing or transport costs, granting rebates, resorting to linked transactions or any other action having similar effect;
Whereas the Government of the Polish People's Republic has, furthermore, stated that it is prepared to communicate regularly to the Commission, through the State foreign trade agency Animex, details of exports of live swine and pig carcases to the Community and to enable the Commission to exercise continuous supervision of the effectiveness of the measures it has taken;
Whereas questions affecting observance of the guarantee given have been discussed in detail with representives of the Polish People's Republic ; whereas following these discussions, it may be assumed that the Polish People's Republic is in a position to abide by its guarantee ; whereas, consequently, there is no need to levy an additional amount on imports of the above-mentioned products originating in and coming from the Polish People's Republic;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 28 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Midi-Pyrénées; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;

Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas the Commission, in order to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty and the Community provisions on the common organization of the market in wine, requires accurate up to date data on the production potential of the areas under vines in the Community and on medium-term trends in production and supply;
Whereas Article 1 of Regulation No 24 on the progressive establishment of a common organization of the market in wine (3) provided that Member States should, not later than 31 December 1964, prepare a viticultural land register which should thereafter be kept up to date;
Whereas Commission Regulation No 26/64/EEC of 28 February 1964 laying down additional provisions for the preparation of the viticultural land register, for its management and for keeping it up to date (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1456/76 (5), provides that the complete revision of the Community viticultural land register referred to in Article 3 (1) should take place every 10 years, beginning in 1979;
Whereas a land register in the strict sense involves major administrative work on the establishment, processing and constant updating of a list or register containing information on the owners and on all parcels of land under vines with sufficient details for their identification ; whereas viticultural land registers in this sense have been established only by some Member States, which have moreover been able to update them only partially and at irregular intervals ; whereas the surveys on the areas under vines carried out by certain Member States have different reference years ; whereas these national land registers and surveys do not therefore permit precise uniform synchronized observation of production potential and supply on the Community vine markets;
Whereas, in order to assess the Community wine market situation and developments therein, every 10 years basic statistical surveys covering the total areas under vines should be conducted in vine-growing holdings and, in between the basic surveys, smaller statistical surveys should be conducted only on the area under vines of wine grape varieties;
Whereas, for economic and technical reasons and in view of their limited significance on the Community wine market, vines cultivated in the open air in Member States with a total area under vines of less than 500 hectares, vines cultivated under glass and vines produced on very small areas solely for home consumption by the growers should all be excluded from the surveys;
Whereas detailed information is necessary on the use of the area under vines for the production of wine grapes, table grapes and material for vegetative propagation of vines, as well as on the varieties and the age of the vines ; whereas the overproduction of table wine in particular can create serious difficulties in the wine economies of certain producer countries ; whereas it is therefore necessary to record separately the area under vines intended for the production of quality wines psr and of table wines;
Whereas, in order to keep the development of wine production potential under constant observation, there should be annual intermediate surveys of any changes by way of grubbing, new planting or replanting in the area under vines of wine grape varieties;
Whereas the results of both the basic and the intermediate surveys should be forwarded to the Commission as quickly as possible;  (1)OJ No C 276, 20.11.1978, p. 1. (2)OJ No C 296, 11.12.1978, p. 58.

Whereas consideration should also be given to statistics resulting from the application of other Community provisions laying down measures for reorganizing Community wine production;
Whereas, since sample survey methods can produce accurate results at moderate cost over large areas under vines, Member States should be allowed to conduct the surveys either exhaustively or by sample, provided that standards of statistical reliability are laid down;
Whereas, in order to be able to assess the production of wine in the Community, information is required each year on yields per hectare and on the mean natural alcoholic strength of fresh grapes, of grape must and of wine ; whereas, in view of the existence of areas with widely differing yields, the area under vines of wine grape varieties should be subdivided into yield classes;
Whereas the Commission must submit reports in order to enable the Council to examine the extent to which the surveys carried out and the information communicated can help achieve the objectives of this Regulation ; whereas, where appropriate, it must propose the harmonization of the methods used;
Whereas Member States and the Commission must cooperate as fully as possible when applying this Regulation ; whereas the implementing rules must be laid down after consultation with the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics, set up by Decision 72/279/EEC (1);
Whereas the procedure to be followed by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics must be laid down;
Whereas statistical surveys allow production potential to be adjusted to market demand in good time ; whereas such adjustment can considerably reduce the ever-increasing costs of managing the wine market ; whereas the Community should therefore be made financially responsible with regard to the expenses incurred by the Member States concerned in connection with the first basic survey under this Regulation;
Whereas the establishment of the survey system under this Regulation requires the consequent amendment of certain Community provisions in the wine sector,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 357/79 of 5 February 1979 on statistical surveys of areas under vines', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(1) The standard EN 10080:2005 ‘Steel for the reinforcement of concrete — Weldable reinforcing steel — General’ was established by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 21 April 2005.

(2) Italy and the Commission have raised formal objections in respect of standard EN 10080:2005.
(3) The Italian formal objection was lodged on the grounds that EN 10080:2005 does not satisfy the essential requirement of mechanical resistance and stability in Annex I to Directive 89/106/EEC as it does not differentiate clearly the intended use of the reinforcing steels, i.e. the reinforcing steel with specific performance required for use in seismic areas which is an important safety issue of works regulated in Italy.
(4) The Commission’s formal objection was lodged on the grounds that the Annex ZA to EN 10080:2005 foresees the indication of the performance characteristics according to technical classes, while the standard itself neither defines the technical classes nor the corresponding technical performance characteristics.
(5) In the light of the results of the examination of the objections raised against the reference of standard EN 10080:2005 ‘Steel for the reinforcement of concrete — Weldable reinforcing steel — General’, the reference of standard EN 10080:2005 should be withdrawn from the list of harmonised standards in the Official Journal of the European Union with the result that compliance with relevant national standards transposing the harmonised standard EN 10080:2005 no longer confers the presumption of fitness for use and of conformity to the relevant provisions of Directive 89/106/EEC,","{'header': '8.12.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 343/102', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 5 December 2006\non the withdrawal of the reference of standard EN 10080:2005 ‘Steel for the reinforcement of concrete — Weldable reinforcing steel — General’ in accordance with Council Directive 89/106/EEC\n(notified under document number C(2006) 5869)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/893/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The standard EN 10080:2005 ‘Steel for the reinforcement of concrete — Weldable reinforcing steel — General’ was established by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) on 21 April 2005.

(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 28 of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 the provisions applicable to the importation of products referred to in Annexes VII and VIII to that Regulation from non-member countries are not to be more favourable or less favourable than those applicable to the production and marketing of those products in the Community. Chapter V of Annex VII to that Regulation should therefore be amended, in order to introduce certain technical amendments, to harmonise the processing standards for milk and milk products and to clarify the import requirements applicable to them.
(4) Following the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, adopted on 29 March 2006, related to the animal health risks of feeding animals with ready-to-use dairy products without further treatment (2), it is appropriate to amend the specific hygiene requirements for milk, milk-based products and colostrums. Account should also be taken of the methods for the inactivation of possible foot-and-mouth disease virus in milk described in the 1999 Report of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on a Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot-and-Mouth Disease (3) and of Appendix 3.6.2 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (4), 2005 edition, of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
(5) Taking account of the amended specific hygiene requirements in Chapter V of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, it is appropriate to replace the model health certificates in Chapters 2(A), 2(B) and 2(C) of Annex X to that Regulation by a single model certificate for the importation from third countries of milk and milk products not intended for human consumption.
(6) It is necessary to update the reference to the specific health certificate in Part I of Annex XI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 setting out lists of third countries from which Member States may authorise imports of animal by-products not intended for human consumption.
(7) Annexes VII, X and XI to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

Whereas approval of confidentiality should not, however, impinge on the other obligations pursuant  to Directive 76/768/EEC and the responsibilities arising from the Articles concerning the cosmetic  product's safety, from the Annexes, and from the provisions as to the information necessary for  appropriate medical treatment and the case-file to which the national monitoring authorities must  have access;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority of the Member State that received the notification for the placing on the market of that product, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.
(2) A notification concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) was submitted by Florigene Ltd, Melbourne, Australia, to the competent authority of the Netherlands in March 2007.
(3) The notification covers import, distribution and retailing of Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12 as for any other carnation.
(4) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of the Netherlands prepared an assessment report, which was submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States. That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) for ornamental use should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled.
(5) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.
(6) The opinion adopted on 12 March 2008 (published 26 March 2008) (2) by the European Food Safety Authority (hereafter EFSA), concluded, from all evidence provided, that cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) are unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use. EFSA also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the notifier is in line with the intended use of the carnation.
(7) An examination of the full notification, additional information provided by the notifier, specific objections raised by the Member States and the opinion of EFSA, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of cut flowers of the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed ornamental use.
(8) A unique identifier has been assigned to the genetically modified carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12) for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(9) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended use with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.
(10) Proposed labelling, on a label or in an accompanying document, should include wording to inform operators and final users that the cut flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12 can not be used for human or animal consumption nor for cultivation.
(11) A detection method as required by Annex III B.D.12 to Directive 2001/18/EC, was verified, tested and single-laboratory validated for the Dianthus caryophyllus L., line 123.8.12 in January 2008 by the Community Reference Laboratory established by Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC (1), and in particular Article 6(1), Article 7(e), and Article 13(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 of 12 March 2010 laying down lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof authorised for the introduction into the European Union of certain animals and fresh meat and the veterinary certification requirements (2) lays down the list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which live ungulate animals, including those susceptible to bluetongue, may be introduced into the Union and the veterinary certification requirements for such introduction.
(2) In particular, with regard to animals susceptible to bluetongue, certificates BOV-X, BOV-Y, OVI-X, OVI-Y and RUM set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 include inter alia the requirement that the animals come from a territory which, at the date of issue of the certificate accompanying them had been free from bluetongue for a period of twelve months.
(3) As a result of new technical developments, ""inactivated vaccines"" against bluetongue have become available which do not pose the risk of undesired local circulation of the vaccine virus to unvaccinated cattle, sheep and goats. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for the control of bluetongue and for the prevention of clinical disease in such animals in the Union.
(4) To ensure better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and to reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, the rules on vaccination laid down in Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (3) were recently amended by Directive 2012/5/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production.
(5) Accordingly, Directive 2000/75/EC now provides for the use of inactivated vaccines in all parts of the EU.
(6) As a result of the evolving epidemiological situation as regards bluetongue, and to align with the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) standards, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 of 26 October 2007 on implementing rules for Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of certain animals of susceptible species in relation to bluetongue (5) was amended recently. The EU standards require the absence of virus circulation for a minimum period of two years in order to consider a territory free from bluetongue. The period of twelve months referred to in the relevant certificates set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Directive 2000/75/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 apply to intra-Union movements of live ungulates of species susceptible to bluetongue. It is appropriate that the models of veterinary certificates BOV-X, BOV-Y, OVI-X, OVI-Y and RUM set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 be amended to align the animal health requirements for imports into the Union, as regards bluetongue, to the requirements for intra-Union movement in animals susceptible to that disease.
(8) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

of 4 July 1990
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics originating in the People's Republic of China, and accepting an undertaking offered by the exporter
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 10 and 11 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for in the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In September 1989, the Commission received a complaint lodged by the International Association of Users of Yarn of Man-made Fabrics and of Natural Silk (Aiuffass) on behalf of Spinnhuette GmbH & Co., KG Seidentechnik, a company representing the entire Community production of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics.
The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of resulting material injury, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics, falling within CN codes ex 5007 10 00, ex 5007 20 10, and ex 5007 20 21 and originating in the People's Republic of China, and commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant. It sent questionnaires to the parties directly concerned and also gave them the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) All of the known interested parties, the Community producer, an independent importer and the exporter, returned the questionnaire duly completed to the Commission. The exporter and the importer also made known their views in writing. The exporter requested and was granted a hearing.
(4) The Commission verified the information received to the extent it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following companies:
(a) Community producer:
Spinnhuette GmbH & Co., KG Seidentechnik, Celle, Germany;
(b) Community importer:
H. Delacamp GmbH & Co., KG, Hamburg, Germany.
(5) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January 1989 to 30 September 1989.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION
(6) The product subject to investigation is a plain woven silk fabric made out of raw silk of a weight of 40 g/m2 or more but not exceeding 50 g/m2. The product is used by the office supplies industry for inking and for the further manufacture of typewriter ribbon spools.
(7) With respect to the physical and technical characteristics, the uses and the markets for this product, the Commission has concluded that the Chinese imports are like products to those produced in the Community, within the meaning of Article 2 (12) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
C. DUMPING
(8) In order to establish whether the imports originating in the People's Republic of China were dumped, the Commission had to take account of the fact that this country does not have a market economy and the Commission therefore had to base its determination on the normal value in a market economy country.
(9) The complainant had claimed that the Community producer and the Chinese producer are the only producers of the product in question in the world. This information has not been contested by any interested party during the investigation and so the normal value was determined, in accordance with Article 2 (5) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, by reference to the prices actually paid or payable in the Community, duly adjusted to include a profit margin of 5 %, considered to be reasonable for this product.
(10) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
(11) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability. Such as physical characteristics, payment terms, transport and insurance costs. All comparisons were trade at an ex-works level.
(12) The examination of the facts shows that imports of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics originating in the People's Republic of China were being dumped, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. The weighted average dumping margin for the exporter, as a percentage of the cif price of the product at the Community frontier, was 47,2 %.
D. INJURY
(a) Volume and price of imports
(13) With regard to the injury, the Commission has established that imports into the Community from the People's Republic of China of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics, in volume terms, fell during the period 1986 to 1988 but that in the first nine months of 1989 the level of imports was equivalent to that for all the preceeding year 1988. As a result, the market share of the exporter, which had remained almost constant during 1986 to 1988, increased in absolute terms by 6 % during the first nine months of 1989. These products are imported into the Federal Republic of Germany by an importer, who subsequently re-sells throughout the Community, although the Federal Republic of Germany is the main market for these products, representing over 80 % of total Community consumption.
(14) The weighted average resale prices of these imports undercut the prices of the Community producer during the investigation period by between 10 to 15 % and were lower than those required to cover the costs of the Community producer and to provide a reasonable profit. The level of the import prices also deprived the Community producer of price increases which normally would have occurred during this same time period from the increasing costs of its raw materials.
(b) Impact on the Community industry
(15) Over the period from 1986 to 1988, production, capacity utilization and sales declined for the Community industry although market share remained stable. However, for the first nine months of 1989, there was a significant deterioration in all these factors with a reduction of market share of 6 %. The Community producer, which had operated with reasonable profit margins in 1987 and 1988, began to generate financial losses in 1989 and had therefore to reduce its level of employment with the introduction of short time working for its remaining employees.
(c) Causality
(16) Given the development of the increase in volume and the gain of market share of the dumped imports, the decline in sales and loss of market share of the Community industry during the first nine months of 1989 and the fact that prices of the dumped imports have undercut and suppressed the prices of the Community industry, the Commission has concluded that the injury suffered by the Community industry was caused by the effect of dumped imports, originating in the People's Republic of China, into the Community.
(17) The Commisson examined whether other factors might have been responsible for the injury to the Community industry. There are no imports originating in other third countries. Consumption in the Community of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics has been falling steadily in the Community by approximately 10 % per annum. Whereas this trend in consumption can explain the decrease in sales of the Community producer during the period in which injury has been examined, it cannot explain the significant loss of market share in the first nine months of 1989, which is clearly paralleled by an increase in market share by the exporter. Equally the Community producer was profitable in the years 1987 and 1988 when consumption was also declining, and therefore the Commission does not consider that falling consumption has contributed to the injury found.
(d) Conclusion
(18) In these circumstances, the Commission has concluded that the volume of Chinese dumped imports, and the prices at which they are offered for sale in the Community, taken in isolation, have to be considered as causing material injury to the Community industry concerned.
E. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(19) Although the requirements of the Community for silk typewriter ribbon are not great and are diminishing, there is and will continue to be a demand for this product in the Community. It would not be in the Community's interest for there to be a sole supplier of this product. The material injury caused to the Community producer by the dumped imports puts its survival at risk. Any protective measures should not however lead to the withdrawal of Chinese imports from the market or eliminate competition between these imports and Community production. The Community producer is in the weaker competitive position, quite apart from the fact that it is suffering from the dumping from China, since it is dependent on China for its supplies of raw silk. The Commission considers that the Community interest would best be protected by the imposition of a provisional anti-dumping duty and the acceptance of a price undertaking which should ensure the maintenance of effective competition between the two suppliers.
(20) The Commission considers that the situation warrants the imposition of provisional measures at this stage of the proceeding in order to prevent further injury being caused during the remainder of the proceeding.
F. MEASURES
Price undertaking
(21) The only known exporter of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics, China National Silk Import and Export Corporation - Zhejiang Branch, requested and was informed of the main conclusions of the investigation; it submitted its comments and subsequently offered a price undertaking.
(22) This undertaking has the effect of raising prices by an amount which in no case exceeds the dumping margin established but which is sufficient to remove the injury caused to the Community industry, since the price of the imports plus the importer's costs and profit is thereby raised to the level of a selling price at which the Community producer can make a reasonable profit. It is, moreover, possible to monitor and control that this undertaking is respected. Under these circumstances, the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the investigations can be terminated for the exporter concerned without imposing an anti-dumping duty.
In addition, where there is reason to believe that the undertaking has been violated, provisional and definitive duties may be imposed based on the facts established before the acceptance of the undertaking.
This solution met with no objection within the Advisory Committee.
Duty
(23) On the basis of the information available, the Commission believes that the exporter, who has offered an undertaking, currently represents all Chinese exports of the pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics to the Community. However, in order to safeguard the effectiveness of the undertaking and to prevent possible circumvention by the appearance of other exporters in the future, a provisional anti-dumping duty should be imposed.
(24) The Commission considered that this duty should be based on the facts established in the investigation period for the exporter who fully cooperated in the investigation. Consequently, having regard to the extent of the injury caused, the rate of such a duty should be less than the dumping margin provisionally established but adequate to remove the injury caused. Having taken into account the selling price needed to provide an adequate profit (5 % margin on the sales price for this product) for the Community producer and the purchase price of the Community importer and their costs and profit margin, the Commission determined the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury to be 24,6 % of the net free-at-Community-frontier price, not cleared through customs. The Commission considered that, to ensure the effectiveness of the protective measures and to facilitate customs clearance, the provisional duty should take the form of an ad valorem duty.
G. TIME LIMIT
(25) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, a period should be fixed within which the interested parties may make their views known and apply to be heard orally by the Commission.","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1937/90 of 4 July 1990 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of pure silk typewriter ribbon fabrics originating in the people's Republic of China, and accepting an undertaking offered by the exporter"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

By the same Regulation an undertaking offered by the German Democratic Republic exporter was accepted by the Commission and the proceeding as it concerned Spain was terminated.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, a Brazilian exporter concerned made written submissions making known its views on the duty.
This exporter also requested to be informed of certain facts and essential considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to recommend definitive action, and this request was granted.
C. Dumping
(3) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty. The Commission, therefore, considers its findings on dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2553/84 to be definitive.
D. Injury
(4) Although the abovementioned Brazilian exporter alleged that the Community industry was not being injured by the dumped imports, no fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry has been submitted.
The Commission has therefore confirmed the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 2553/84.
(5) In the Commission's view, therefore, the facts as finally determined show that the injury being caused by dumped imports of oxalic acid originating in Brazil, taken in isolation from that caused by other factors, has to be considered as material.
E. Community interest
(6) No information has been submitted regarding Community interests subsequent to the imposition of the provisional duty and the Commission's conclusions on Community interest in Regulation (EEC) No 2553/84 therefore remain unchanged.
In these circumstances, protection of the Community's interest calls for the imposition of a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of oxalic acid originating in Brazil.
F. Definitive duty
(7) In the light of the above determinations and since the Commission's conclusions on the rate of the provisional anti-dumping duty as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2553/84 have remained unchanged, the amount of the definitive anti-dumping duty should be the same as the amount of the provisional anti-dumping duty.
G. Undertaking
(8) The only Brazilian exporter to cooperate in the investigation, IndĂşstrias Qumicas e Explosivos SA, having been informed that the main findings of the preliminary investigation had been confirmed, offered an undertaking which the Commission considered would eliminate the injury caused by the dumped imports and which was therefore considered acceptable,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 228/85 of 29 January 1985 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of oxalic acid originating in Brazil', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/660/EEC of 4 December 1990 on the transitional measures applicable in Germany with regard to certain Community provisions relating to the protection of the environment, in connection with the internal market (1),
Whereas Article 1 (2) of Directive 90/660/EEC provides that the Federal Republic of Germany shall take the measures necessary to ensure that substances and preparations which do not comply with Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the  approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances (2), as last amended by Directive 90/517/EEC (3), are not placed on the territory of the Community other  than the territory of the former German Democratic Republic; whereas any substance which does not appear on the inventory provided for in Article 13 of Directive 67/548/EEC (European inventory of existing commercial chemical substances - Einecs (4))  must be notified in accordance with the provisions of that Directive; whereas the conditions governing the notification of substances existing on the market of the former German Democratic Republic prior to 18 September 1981 which do not appear on the  inventory shall be laid down by the Commission;
Whereas any derogations from Community law provided for in connection with regard to the specific situation existing in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic must be temporary and cause the least possible disturbance to the functioning  of the common market and must also reflect the high standard of protection for man and the environment achieved in the Community;
Whereas it seems, therefore, to be appropriate to subject chemical substances existing on the market of the former German Democratic Republic prior to 18 September 1981 which do not appear on the inventory to a simplified notification procedure with  certain minimum requirements, similar to Article 6 (1) of Directive 67/548/EEC,","{'title': '92/3/EEC: Commission Decision of 9 December 1991 establishing the conditions governing the notification of chemical substances existing on the market of the former German Democratic Republic prior to 18 September 1981 which do not appear on the inventory provided for in Article 13 of Directive 67/548/EEC (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Decision concerns the conditions governing the notification of substances existing on the market of the former German Democratic Republic prior to 18 September 1981 which do not appear on the inventory provided for in Article 13 of  Directive 67/548/EEC.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nSubstances covered by this Decision are those which do not appear on the inventory provided for in Article 13 of Directive 67/548/EEC for which proof can be furnished to the satisfaction of the German competent authorities established  pursuant to Article 7 (1) of Directive 67/548/EEC, that they existed on the market in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic prior to 18 September 1981.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nFor all substances defined in Article 2 the provisions of Directive 67/548/EEC are applicable unless otherwise specified.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community;
Having regard to Council Directive No 72/161/EEC (1) of 17 April 1972 concerning the provision of socio-economic guidance for and the acquisition of occupational skills by persons engaged in agriculture, and in particular Article 11 (3) thereof;
Whereas on 8 January 1974, 6 November 1974 and 21 January 1975 the Government of Denmark, acting in pursuance of the second indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive No 72/161/EEC, forwarded the text of the following provisions for the implementation of Title II of that Directive (on the acquisition of occupational skills by persons engaged in agriculture):    - Law No 259 of 4 June 1970 on adult education colleges, agricultural colleges, domestic science colleges and continuation schools;
- Order No 271 of 2 June 1971 under the Law relating to the vocational training of semi-skilled workers etc. and to retraining;
- Order No 388 of 17 August 1972 under the Law on spare-time education etc.;
- Law No 29 of 3 February 1960 on state aids for agricultural training courses;
- Order of the Ministry of Education of 7 October 1974 on theoretical basic training for farmers who have not attended an agricultural college but who possess several years' practical experience of farming;
Whereas on 8 January 1974 and 21 January 1975 the Government of Denmark also forwarded additional information and documentation regarding courses of training and further training in agriculture already in existence under the above laws;
Whereas, under Article 11 (3) of Directive No 72/161/EEC, the Commission must decide whether, having regard to the objectives of the Directive and to the need for a proper connection between the various measures, the provisions forwarded comply with the Directive and thus satisfy the conditions for financial contribution by the Community;
Whereas it is a basic aim of Title II of Directive No 72/161/EEC to enable persons aged 18 or over engaged in agriculture to have the opportunity of acquiring new agricultural skills, or of improving those which they already possess, so that they are in a position to be able to integrate into modern agriculture;
Whereas, to that end, the Member States are therefore required under Articles 5 (1) and 6 (1) of Directive No 72/161/EEC to introduce, in addition to the normal agricultural training provided in their country, measures designed to give farmers and hired and family agricultural workers further training of a general, technical and economic nature;  (1)OJ No L 96, 23.4.1972, p. 15.
Whereas under the third indent of Article 12 (2) of Directive No 72/161/EEC the Guidance Section of the EAGGF is to refund to Member States 25 % of the expenditure incurred in respect of such measures, up to a maximum of 1 500 units of account for each person engaged in agriculture having completed a course of basic or advanced vocational training;
Whereas the theoretical courses of basic training for farmers who have not attended an agricultural college but who possess several years' practical experience of farming which already exist under Law No 259 of 4 June 1970 and the Order of 7 October 1974 satisfy the requirements imposed in respect of complete courses designed to enable persons engaged in agriculture generally to improve their occupational skills or to acquire new ones;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 20(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The approval of the active substance Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97, previously referred to as ‘Paecilomyces fumosoroseus Apopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874’, as set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (2), expires on 31 December 2015.
(2) An application for the renewal of the inclusion of Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC (3) was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1141/2010 (4) within the time period provided for in that Article.
(3) The applicant submitted the supplementary dossiers required in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No 1141/2010. The application was found to be complete by the rapporteur Member State.
(4) The rapporteur Member State prepared a renewal assessment report in consultation with the co-rapporteur Member State and submitted it to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and the Commission on 3 June 2013.
(5) The Authority communicated the renewal assessment report to the applicant and to the Member States for comments and forwarded the comments received to the Commission. The Authority also made the supplementary summary dossier available to the public.
(6) On 28 April 2014 (5) the Authority communicated to the Commission its conclusion on whether Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 can be expected to meet the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. The Commission presented the draft review report for Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 to the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed on 12 December 2014.
(7) It has been established with respect to one or more representative uses of at least one plant protection product that the approval criteria provided for in Article 4 are satisfied. Those approval criteria are therefore deemed to be satisfied.
(8) The Commission further considered that Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 is a low-risk active substance pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 is not a substance of concern and fulfils the conditions set in Annex II point 5 to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 is a micro-organism for which following the assessment by the Rapporteur Member State and the Authority taking into account the intended uses is expected to pose a low risk for humans, animals and the environment. Firstly no mycotoxins are detected and the substances produced by the strain are clearly identified and are not of toxicological concern. Therefore the risk for operators, workers consumers and the environment is considered to be low. Secondly the strain has a low viability in an aquatic environment and is not related to any known fish or daphnid pathogenes. Therefore the risk for aquatic non-target organisms is considered to be low. Finally taking into account the intended uses, no concentrated quantities of the microorganisms are released in the sewages and this indicates a low risk to biological methods of sewage treatment.
(9) It is therefore appropriate to renew the approval of Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97 and to include it in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 as a low-risk active substance.
(10) In accordance with Article 22(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, low risk substances are to be listed separately in the Regulation referred to in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is therefore appropriate to add a Part D in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011. That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) This Regulation should apply from the day after the date of expiry of the approval of the active substance Isaria fumosorosea strain Apopka 97.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,","{'header': '27.2.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 56/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/306\nof 26 February 2015\nrenewing the approval of the active substanceIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market, and amending the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The approval of the active substanceIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97, previously referred to as ‘Paecilomyces fumosoroseusApopka strain 97, PFR 97 or CG 170, ATCC20874’, as set out in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011(2), expires on 31 December 2015.\n\n((2)) An application for the renewal of the inclusion ofIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC(3)was submitted in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) No\xa01141/2010(4)within the time period provided for in that Article.\n\n((3)) The applicant submitted the supplementary dossiers required in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No\xa01141/2010.

Those approval criteria are therefore deemed to be satisfied.\n\n((8)) The Commission further considered thatIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 is a low-risk active substance pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.Isaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 is not a substance of concern and fulfils the conditions set in Annex II point 5 to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.Isaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 is a micro-organism for which following the assessment by the Rapporteur Member State and the Authority taking into account the intended uses is expected to pose a low risk for humans, animals and the environment. Firstly no mycotoxins are detected and the substances produced by the strain are clearly identified and are not of toxicological concern. Therefore the risk for operators, workers consumers and the environment is considered to be low. Secondly the strain has a low viability in an aquatic environment and is not related to any known fish or daphnid pathogenes. Therefore the risk for aquatic non-target organisms is considered to be low. Finally taking into account the intended uses, no concentrated quantities of the microorganisms are released in the sewages and this indicates a low risk to biological methods of sewage treatment.\n\n((9)) It is therefore appropriate to renew the approval ofIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97 and to include it in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 as a low-risk active substance.\n\n((10)) In accordance with Article 22(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, low risk substances are to be listed separately in the Regulation referred to in Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is therefore appropriate to add a Part D in the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011. That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) This Regulation should apply from the day after the date of expiry of the approval of the active substanceIsaria fumosoroseastrain Apopka 97.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plants, Animals, Food and Feed,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Renewal of the approval of active substance', 'text': 'Article 1\nRenewal of the approval of active substance\nThe approval of the active substance\nIsaria fumosorosea\nstrain Apopka 97, as specified in Annex I, is renewed subject to the conditions laid down in that Annex.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Amendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011', 'text': 'Article 2\nAmendments to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0In Article 1 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 the second paragraph is replaced by the following paragraph:\n‘The active substances approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are as set out in Part B of the Annex to this Regulation.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in order to carry out the tasks assigned to it, the Commission must be kept informed of the position and trend of earnings in the Member States of the Community with regard, on the one hand, to their variations in terms of the structure of the labour force and, on the other hand, to the distribution of employees according to earnings level;
Whereas the development of the Community and the operation of the internal market increase the need for comparable data on the structure of earnings, particularly as a means of analysing the progress of economic and social cohesion and for establishing reliable comparisons between the Member States and the regions of the Community;
Whereas the best method of assessing the situation as regards the structure and distribution of earnings is to produce Community statistics of the structure of earnings using harmonized methods and definitions, as was done in 1966, 1972, 1974 and 1978 pursuant to Regulations No 188/64/EECC (1), (EEC) No 2395/71 (2), (EEC) No 178/74 (3), and (EEC) No 495/78 (4) respectively;
Whereas, owing to the changes which occur in the structure of the labour force and in the distribution of earnings, particularly as regards economic activities, the results of the earlier surveys are no longer up to date and do not cover all the Member States;
Whereas the data currently available for the Member States as a whole supply only averages and are not therefore likely to provide any indication either of the relationship between earnings and the individual characteristics of wage earners (particularly age, sex, professional status, length of service) or of the spread of earnings;
Whereas statistical information in this field is available only in certain Member States and valid comparisons cannot therefore be made; whereas the statistics of the structure of earnings must consequently be carried out on the basis of common definitions and harmonized methodologies;
Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards enabling harmonized information to be produced is action which can be effectively undertaken only at Community level; whereas these standards will be implemented in each Member State on the authority of the agencies and institutions appointed to compile official statistics;
Whereas, pursuant to Decision 93/464/EEC (5), the production of Community statistics on the structure of earnings is one of the priority actions in the Statistical Programme 1993 to 1997;
Whereas it seems appropriate to make provisions for exceptions for certain Member States, in order to take account of particular technical difficulties encountered by such States in the collection of certain types of information, provided that the quality of the statistical information is not affected;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 3, 9d(1) and 9e(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The applications for the authorisation of the additives listed in the Annexes to this Regulation were submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) The use of the micro-organism preparation of Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 866/1999 (3). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that micro-organism preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that micro-organism preparation, as specified in Annex I, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(6) The use of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 528.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 418/2001 (4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time-limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex II, should be authorised without a time-limit.
(7) The use of the enzyme preparation of 3-phytase produced by Trichoderma reesei (CBS 528.94) was provisionally authorised for the first time for sows and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 358/2005 (5). It was authorised without a time-limit for pigs for fattening and piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 943/2005 (6). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to laying hens. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.
(8) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2106) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (ATCC 2105) was authorised without a time-limit for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 833/2005 (7). New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to piglets. The EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.
(9) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Aspergillus aculeatus (CBS 589.94), endo-1,4-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma longibrachiatum (CBS 592.94), alpha-amylase produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9553), bacillolysin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (DSM 9554) and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma viride (NIBH FERM BP 4842) was provisionally authorised for the first time for piglets by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2437/2000 (8). It was authorised without a time-limit for chickens for fattening by Regulation (EC) No 358/2005. New data were submitted in support of an application to extend the authorisation of the use of this enzyme preparation to turkeys for fattening. The EFSA has delivered an opinion on the use of this preparation which concludes that it does not present a risk for this additional animal category. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 9e(1) of Directive 70/524/EEC for an authorisation of that preparation for that use are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex III, should be provisionally authorised for four years.
(10) The assessment of these applications shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annexes. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (9).

fixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'header': '17.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 370/57', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) Νo 2158/2004\nof 16 December 2004\nfixing the export refunds on products processed from cereals and rice', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other.

In its letter of 8 October 1990, the German Government also informed the Commission, pursuant to Article 9 (3), of a supplementary measure it intends to take in support of the coal industry with regard to 1989.
Pursuant to the above Decision, the Commission must give a ruling on the following financial measures submitted to it for approval:
- aid totalling DM 3 550 million to sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry in 1990,
- aid totalling DM 152 million under a scheme for maintaining the underground labour force in deep mines (Bergmannspraemie) for 1990,
- aid totalling DM 20 million for special depreciation in 1990,
- aid totalling DM 306 million to finance social benefit schemes in the coal industry in 1990, corresponding to the difference between actual and standard social charges,
- supplementary aid totalling DM 982 million to sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry in 1989.
The measures which the German Government intends to take to support the coal industry comply with the provisions of Article 1 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC. The Commission must therefore give a ruling under Article 10 of the Decision as to whether  they comply with the objectives and criteria set out in that Decision and whether they are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
II
In accordance with Articles 4 and 12 of the Decision, coal undertakings are authorized, where necessary, to grant rebates on their list prices or production costs for deliveries to the Community iron and steel industry under long-term contract of coking  coal, blast furnace coke and coal for injection into blast furnaces. These rebates must not cause the delivered prices of Community coal and coke to work out lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries and coke made from  non-member country coking coal.
Since 1 January 1989, the German Government's policy on aid to sales of coal and coke to the Community steel industry has been based on the principle of placing a ceiling on the amount of such aid for the years 1989, 1990 and 1991. The overall amount of  aid planned for the period from 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1991 amounts to DM 10 960 million, while the total quantities eligible for this aid are expected to be 69,8 million tonnes.
On 28 February 1990, the Commission adopted Decision No 90/199/ECSC (2) on aid from the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal industry in 1989. This Decision authorized the German Government to grant aid of DM 2 865 million under the new system to  sales of coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry. The Commission had noted in its Decision that the amount of aid, which corresponded to the budgetary resources available for the year 1989, would not cover the full amount necessary course  of that year to cover an estimated quantity of 24,5 million tonnes of coal and coke.
By its letter of 8 October 1990, the German Government informed the Commission of the adjustment it intended to make to the amount authorized by the Decision. Compared with this amount, the additional sum for 1989 will be DM 982 million, bringing the  total amount of aid to sales of coal and coke for 1989 to DM 3 847 million.
The German Government also plans to pay coal producers, within the framework of the budgetary resources available, a sum of DM 3 550 million for 1990, in respect of production of 23,8 million tonnes of coal and coke.
In view of the notification, the Commission feels that the progressive reduction in aid which is one of the objectives of the new scheme is beginning to take effect. It notes in the light of the information supplied by the German Government that this  downward trend should become more marked in the course of 1991.
The Commission welcomes both the principle of placing a ceiling on aid and its progressive reduction, which should help speed up restructuring of the coal industry and hence improve its competitiveness in conformity with the first indent of Article 2  (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
Moreover, this aid is compatible with the provisions of Articles 4 and 12 of the Decision, as it does not lead to delivered prices lower than those which would be charged for coal from non-member countries.
It will also be necessary, pursuant to Article 11 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, to ensure that this aid does not lead to discrimination within the meaning of the ECSC Treaty, as between Community buyers or users of coal or coke.
The German Government is to communicate at the end of 1990 any changes with regard to sales and information relating to production costs and the guide price, in order to enable the Commission to ensure that all the abovementioned provisions are complied  with.
III
The aid of DM 152 million to finance mineworkers' bonuses (Bergmannspraemie) of DM 10 for every shift worked underground enables the undertakings to maintain a skilled underground workforce. This type of aid, which helps to increase productivity, is  specifically provided for in Article 6 of the Decision and contributes to an improvement of the competitiveness of the industry in accordance with the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.
The aid covering special depreciation improves the competitiveness of the coal industry in that it enables restructuring to be speeded-up.
Since, at 0,1 % of the production cost, it is very low, this aid will not give the German coal undertakings a significant competitive advantage over other Community coal producers, especially since the returns do not cover the production costs. In view  of its purpose, this measure conforms to the objective specified in the first indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.
The information supplied to the Commission regarding aid to finance social benefit schemes in the coal industry shows that the aid which the German Government intends to grant for these purposes makes the ratio between the burden per mineworker in  employment and the benefits per person in receipt of benefit lower than the corresponding ratio in other industries. The difference between actual and standard charges in 1990 amounts to DM 306 million. Since the limits set in Article 7 of Decision No  2064/86/ECSC have thereby been exceeded, this must be considered as indirect aid to current production and must be examined on the basis of Article 10 (2) of the Decision. The reduction of about 1 % in production costs which it entails will not give the  German coal industry a significant competitive advantage over other Community coal producers. Since this measure reduces the industry's operating costs, it helps solve the social and regional problems relating to developments in the coal industry by  permitting a better phasing of restructuring and rationalization measures. It thus helps to achieve the objective referred to in the third indent of Article 2 (1) of the Decision.
IV
Consequently, the aid measures referred to in this Decision are compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
This Decision does not prejudge the compatibility with Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of the amounts of aid scheduled by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany for the years following 1990 under the system it has established for aid to sales of  coal and coke to the Community iron and steel industry,","{'title': '91/406/ECSC: Commission Decision of 6 February 1991 on financial aid by the Federal Republic of Germany to the coal industry in 1990 and supplementary aid to the coal industry for 1989 (only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Government of the Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorized to grant aid of DM 4 028 million to the German coal industry for the 1990 calendar year.

(2) Pharmacologically active substances and their classification regarding MRLs in foodstuffs of animal origin are set out in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 (2).
(3) An application for the establishment of maximum residue limits for lufenuron in salmonidae has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency.
(4) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the establishment of a MRL for lufenuron for salmonidae, applicable to muscle and skin in natural proportions.

(6) The Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use recommended the extrapolation of the MRLs for lufenuron from salmonidae to other fin fish species.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 37/2010 should therefore be amended to include the substance lufenuron for fin fish species.

(2004/927/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the second indent of Article 67(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) Under the Treaty of Amsterdam the European Community acquired the power to adopt measures in the field of visas, asylum, immigration and other policies relating to the free movement of persons, as laid down in Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter ‘the Treaty’).
(2) Under Article 67 of the Treaty, as introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, most of those measures were to be adopted by the Council acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament.
(3) Under the second indent of paragraph 2, of the same Article 67, the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the European Parliament, shall take a decision, after a transitional period of five years following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, with a view to providing for all or parts of the areas covered by Title IV to be governed by the procedure referred to in Article 251 thereof.
(4) Pursuant to Article 67(5) of the Treaty which was added by the Treaty of Nice the Council shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251, adopt the asylum-related measures provided for in Article 63(1) and (2)(a) provided that the Council has, unanimously and after consultation of the European Parliament, adopted Community legislation defining the common rules and basic principles governing those issues, as well as the measures on judicial cooperation in civil matters provided for in Article 65 with the exception of aspects relating to family law; those provisions are not affected by this Decision.
(5) Moreover, pursuant to the Protocol on Article 67 of the Treaty, annexed to that Treaty by the Treaty of Nice, as from 1 May 2004 the Council shall act by a qualified majority, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, when adopting the measures referred to in Article 66 of the Treaty; that Protocol is not affected by this Decision.
(6) In addition to that which follows from the Treaty of Nice, when approving ‘the Hague Programme’: ‘Strengthening Freedom, Security and Justice in the European Union’ at its meeting on 4 and 5 November 2004 the European Council asked the Council to adopt a decision based on Article 67(2) of the Treaty no later than 1 April 2005 to the effect that the Council is required to act in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 when adopting, in conformity with the case law of the Court of Justice relating to the choice of legal basis for Community acts, the measures referred to in Article 62(1), (2)(a) and (3) and Article 63(2)(b) and 3(b) of the Treaty.
(7) However, the European Council took the view that, pending the entry into force of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, the Council should continue to act unanimously after consulting the European Parliament when adopting measures in the field of the legal migration of third-country nationals to and between Member States referred to in Article 63(3)(a) and (4) of the Treaty.
(8) The transition to co-decision procedures for the adoption of measures referred to in Article 62(1) of the Treaty is without prejudice to the requirement for the Council to act unanimously when taking the decisions referred to in Article 3(2) of the Act of Accession of 2003, Article 15(1) of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the, implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis (1), Article 4 of the Protocol annexed to the Treaty on the European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union and any future accession treaty.
(9) The transition to codecision procedures for the adoption of measures referred to in Article 62(2)(a) of the Treaty is without prejudice to the competence of the Member States concerning the geographical demarcation of their borders, in accordance with international law.
(10) Incentive measures to support the action of Member States regarding the integration of third country nationals residing legally in their territories might be adopted by the Council acting in accordance with the appropriate legal basis provided for in the Treaty.
(11) As a consequence of the transition to co-decision procedures for the adoption of measures referred to in Articles 62(2) and (3) of the Treaty, the Regulations reserving to the Council implementing powers with regard to certain detailed provisions and practical procedures for examining visa applications and for carrying out border checks and surveillance should be amended so as to require the Council to act by qualified majority in those cases.
(12) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, those Member States have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision,","{'header': '31.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 396/45', 'title':
