Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

Having regard to Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the marketing of compound feedingstuffs (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 82/957/EEC (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas, until Community methods have been introduced, the Member States may not, under the said Directive 79/373/EEC, require or permit declaration of the energy value of compound feedingstuffs except where such a declaration was required or permitted on their territory and official methods of calculation were, moreover, already in application at the time when the said Directive was adopted;
Whereas scientific and technical knowledge is now such that the energy value of compound poultryfeed can be calculated by means of a uniform method in all Member States; whereas this method should therefore be adopted and made applicable not only in Member States which require or permit declaration of the energy value on the labels of compound poultryfeed but also in those Member States which had to wait for the adoption of a Community method before requiring or permitting such declarations;
Whereas in case of differences between the result of the official findings for energy value and the value declared by the manufacturer, it is desirable to permit a minimum tolerance to allow for deviations due to the method used for sampling the feedingstuff, the manufacturing process or analytical divergences;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices (1), and in particular the third paragraph of Article 4 and Article 5(3) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2), as required under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95,
Whereas:
(1) Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices (HICPs) are harmonised inflation figures required by the Commission and the European Central Bank for the performance of their functions under Article 121 of the EC Treaty. HICPs are designed to facilitate international comparisons of consumer price inflation. They serve as important indicators for the management of monetary policy.
(2) Under heading (a) of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, Stage I of the measures necessary to achieve comparable indices of consumer prices entails the production of an interim series of indices.
(3) Under heading (b) of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, during Stage II the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) starts with the index for January 1997, the year 1996 being the common index reference period.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 does not, however, preclude updating the HICPs to another common index reference period.
(5) Following the accession of 10 new Member States in 2004, some HICP sub-indices, governed by the system of classification of individual consumption by purpose adapted to the needs of HICPs (COICOP/HICP), as set in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September 1996 on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices (3), refer to different index reference periods; however, HICPs should be compiled on the basis of common index reference periods in order to ensure comparability in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.
(6) Updating the common index reference period would improve the relevance of the HICPs in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.
(7) It is considered good practice to update the index reference period of price indices when major revisions of the indices are taking place, whether in terms of items, geographical coverage, or both.
(8) It is necessary to establish rules for common index reference periods of COICOP/HICP sub-indices integrated within the HICP at different points in time, in order to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability and relevance requirements of Articles 4 and 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.
(9) In this context it is necessary to clarify and harmonise the terminology in order to guide operational practice concerning reference periods for HICPs. It is further necessary to amend Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96 of 20 November 1996 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices: transmission and dissemination of sub-indices of the HICP (4).

They serve as important indicators for the management of monetary policy.\n\n((2)) Under heading (a) of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, Stage I of the measures necessary to achieve comparable indices of consumer prices entails the production of an interim series of indices.\n\n((3)) Under heading (b) of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, during Stage II the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) starts with the index for January 1997, the year 1996 being the common index reference period.\n\n((4)) Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 does not, however, preclude updating the HICPs to another common index reference period.\n\n((5)) Following the accession of 10 new Member States in 2004, some HICP sub-indices, governed by the system of classification of individual consumption by purpose adapted to the needs of HICPs (COICOP/HICP), as set in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September 1996 on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(3), refer to different index reference periods; however, HICPs should be compiled on the basis of common index reference periods in order to ensure comparability in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.\n\n((6)) Updating the common index reference period would improve the relevance of the HICPs in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.\n\n((7)) It is considered good practice to update the index reference period of price indices when major revisions of the indices are taking place, whether in terms of items, geographical coverage, or both.\n\n((8)) It is necessary to establish rules for common index reference periods of COICOP/HICP sub-indices integrated within the HICP at different points in time, in order to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability and relevance requirements of Articles 4 and 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.\n\n((9)) In this context it is necessary to clarify and harmonise the terminology in order to guide operational practice concerning reference periods for HICPs.

","COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 868/90
of 2 April 1990
imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Yugoslavia and Romania and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duties imposed on such imports
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission following consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional measures
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 3074/89 (2) the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Yugoslavia and Romania.
(2) Regulation (EEC) No 342/90 (3) extended the provisional anti-dumping duty for a period not exceeding two months.
B. Subsequent procedure
(3) Having been informed of the main conclusions of the preliminary investigation, the Romanian exporter and one Yugoslav producer/exporter requested, and were granted, an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. They also made written submissions making known their views of the findings.
C. Dumping
(4) As no new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duties in respect of imports originating in Yugoslavia and Romania, the findings on dumping with regard to Yugoslavia and Romania, as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 3074/89, are therefore considered to be definitive.
D. Injury
(5) With regard to injury, it was claimed by the Romanian exporter that the Commission had imposed anti-dumping duties on certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, falling within CN codes 7306 30 51, 7306 30 59, ex 7306 30 71 and ex 7306 30 79, which had not been exported to the Community by Romania. However, the investigation by the Commission reveals that, during the investigation period, welded tubes falling within all four mentioned CN codes were exported by Romania.
(6) Furthermore, the Romanian exporter claimed that the quantity exported to the Community was approximately the same in 1988 as it was in 1985 and consequently did not cause any injury to the Community production. The Commission is of the opinion that the situation in 1985 cannot be compared to the situation in 1988, because until May 1987 (4) a price undertaking was in force. During the reference period, the injury suffered was due to the price undercutting by the exporter concerned, which was the most attributable factor.
(7) The findings on injury, as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 3074/89, are therefore confirmed.
E. Community interest
(8) No observations were received from any user of welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel imported from Yugoslavia and Romania and subject to provisional anti-dumping duties within the time limit laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 3074/89.
(9) The Commission's conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken is therefore confirmed. Under these circumstances, protection of the Community's interest calls for the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Yugoslavia and Romania.
F. Rate of duty
(10) The provisional anti-dumping duties were calculated as being adequate to remove the injury to the Community industry. The provisional findings of the Commission having been confirmed, the amounts of the definitive anti-dumping duties should be the same as the amounts of the provisional anti-dumping duties.
G. Undertakings
(11) The Romanian exporter, Metalexportimport, and the Yugoslav producer/exporter, Zeljezara Sisak, having been informed that the findings of the preliminary investigation would be confirmed, offered undertakings concerning their exports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, to the Community.
(12) The effect of these undertakings will be to increase the export prices of the products concerned to the Community to an extent sufficient to eliminate the injury caused to the Community industry. The Commission therefore considered the undertakings offered acceptable.
(13) After consultation within the Advisory Committee, these undertakings were accepted by Commission Decision 90/166/EEC (1).
H. Collection of provisional duty
(14) In view of the high level of the dumping margins found and the seriousness of the injury caused to Community producers, it is considered necessary that amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty should be collected in full.","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 868/90 of 2 April 1990 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain welded tubes, of iron or non-alloy steel, originating in Yugoslavia and Romania and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duties imposed on such imports', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 28 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Aquitaine; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under  this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of natural gas supply and repealing Council Directive 2004/67/EC (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 has established a Gas Coordination Group in order to facilitate the coordination of measures concerning security of gas supply. This Group should be composed of the Member States, in particular of their Competent Authorities, as well as the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas and representative bodies of the industry concerned and relevant customers.
(2) Security of gas supply is a shared responsibility of natural gas undertakings, Member States, and the Commission within their respective areas of activities and competence. Moreover, customers using gas for electricity generation or industrial purposes may also have an important role to play in security of gas supply through their ability to respond to a crisis with demand-side measures. Therefore, in order to ensure the best coordination of measures to be taken under Regulation (EU) No 994/2010, the representative bodies of the industry concerned and those of relevant customers should participate actively in the work of the Gas Coordination Group.
(3) The Commission should, in consultation with the Member States, decide on the composition of the Group, ensuring it is fully representative and that a three-level approach is respected which involves first the relevant natural gas undertakings and industry, then Member States at national or regional level, and then the Union.
(4) The following bodies of the industry concerned should be considered to be representative:
— the representative European association of the storage system operators in the sense of Article 2(10) of Directive 2009/73/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 2003/55/EC (2) and of LNG system operators in the sense of Article 2(12) of Directive 2009/73/EC,
— the European association of the gas supplying industry,
— the international association representing gas producers in Europe,
— the European association of gas traders.
(5) As for the relevant consumers, four main sectors consuming natural gas should be distinguished:
— the industrial sector,
— the power sector using gas as a fuel,
— the household sector,
— the district heating sector.
(6) The Gas Coordination Group should act as adviser to the Commission to facilitate the coordination of security of supply measures in the event of a Union or regional emergency. It is also the main body to be consulted by the Commission in the context of the establishment of the Preventive Action Plans and the Emergency Plans. The Gas Coordination Group should monitor the adequacy and appropriateness of measures to be taken under the Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 and exchange all information relevant for security of gas supply at national, regional and Union levels.
(7) Rules on disclosure of information by members of the group should be laid down.
(8) Personal data should be processed in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required pursuant to Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopts a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (4), an initial list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period from 1994 to 1996; whereas this list has been enlarged by Decision 95/189/EC (5) as regards the zones eligible for Objective 2 in Sweden;
Whereas Article 9 (6) second subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 provides that, on an exceptional basis, the Commission can accede to a request from Austria, Finland or Sweden that assistance under Objective 2 be planned and implemented for the whole period from 1995 to 1999; whereas Sweden has requested implementation of this provision and accordingly the assistance under Objective 2 will cover the period 1995 to 1999;
Whereas the Swedish Government has submitted to the Commission on 16 June 1995 the single programming document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Norra Norrlandskusten; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF);
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments, including the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (9), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (10), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (11), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (12), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the single programming document satisfies the conditions and includes the information required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas certain measures provided for in the present single programming document involve co-financing with existing aid schemes that were notified to the EFTA Surveillance Authority as existing aid on entry into force of the Agreement on the European Economic Area or have been approved by the EFTA Surveillance Authority or the Commission since 1 January 1994, or with new or altered aid schemes that have not yet been approved by the Commission; whereas the existing aid schemes will, if necessary, be brought into line with Articles 92 and 93 of the Treaty or replaced by other approved aid schemes;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (13), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (14), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC(2), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(3), as last amended by Directive 92/118/EEC, and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 98/653/EC of 18 November 1998 concerning emergency measures made necessary by the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Portugal(4), as last amended by Decision 1999/713/EC(5), prohibits the dispatch of bovine products until 1 February 2000.
(2) The current BSE incidence rate in Portugal calculated over the past 12 months per 1000000 bovine animals over 24 months of age is 236. According to the Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (International Office of Epizootic Diseases (OIE)), 1999 edition, a country or zone will be classified as having a high incidence of BSE if the BSE incidence rate, calculated over the past 12 months, has been greater than 100 cases per 1000000 animals within the cattle population over 24 months of age in the country or zone.
(3) The OIE Animal Health Code recommends that bovine meat and meat products can only be traded from countries or zones classified as having a high incidence of BSE under certain strict conditions, such as an effective feed ban, a permanent system for the identification of cattle enabling animals to be traced back to the herd and dam of origin, the removal of specified risk materials and the slaughter and complete destruction of certain higher risk animals, such as offspring and birth cohorts of BSE cases. Thereafter bovine meat and products are only eligible for trade on the basis of either of two schemes: namely a certified herds scheme, indicating that the products have been derived from animals born, raised and having remained in herds without BSE cases for the last seven years, or a date-based scheme, indicating that the products were derived from animals born after the date of an effective feed ban.
(4) Missions on BSE-related issues were carried out in Portugal by the Food and Veterinary Office from 14 to 18 June and from 25 to 29 October 1999 the conclusions of which were that Portugal has an effective feed ban and that a complete set of legislation on cattle identification and registration has been introduced.
(5) Portugal put forward a first proposal for a date-based scheme to the Commission on 3 December 1999; this scheme must be examined in the light of measures taken by Portugal as regards the feed ban, the traceability of cattle, the culling of offspring and birth cohorts of BSE cases and the removal of specified risk materials; furthermore the implementation of those measures should be verified by a Community mission before the Commission can propose a partial lifting of the ban to the Standing Veterinary Committee.

Whereas Article 4 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2641/88 of 25 August 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the aid scheme for the use of grapes, grape must and concentrated grape must to produce grape juice (7), as last amended  by Regulation (EEC) No 2056/91 (8), fixes that part of the aid intended to finance 35 % of the promotion campaign;
Whereas Annex IV to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2093/93 of 28 July 1993 fixing the buying-in prices, aids and certain other amounts applicable for the 1993/94 wine year to intervention measures in the wine sector (9), fixes the amount of aid for the  1993/94 wine year;

amending Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(2), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2345/2001(3), and in particular Articles 4(8), 6(7), 11(5), 13(5) and 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For the suckler cow premium, Article 29a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 of 28 October 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 169/2002(5), lays down a rule for the rounding off of the number of animals for the purposes of calculating the minimum and maximum number of heifers expressed as a percentage. Article 17(3) of that Regulation also lays down the number of heifers that may benefit from that premium where a premium application covers two to five animals after adjustment to the individual ceiling. The coexistence of the two rules raises problems in application and produces differences in the way premium applications are dealt with. In order to ensure the application of a single rounding-off rule while retaining the rule that is most favourable to producers, Article 17(3) of the Regulation should be deleted.
(2) Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 lays down certain rules relating to the payment of advances. Due to exceptionally unfavourable weather conditions, producers in some Member States have been unable to harvest enough fodder of sufficiently high quality to feed their livestock throughout the winter. In order to allow producers to meet the additional financial charges resulting from the need to buy additional fodder, an increase in the amount of the advance for the special premium, the suckler cow premium, the slaughter premium and the additional payments should be authorised.
(3) The second paragraph of Article 42 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 lays down special rules as regards the allocation year for animals subject to the special premium scheme where that premium has been granted in accordance with one of the options provided for in Article 8 of that Regulation. Under the above Article 8, Member States which decide to grant the special premium at the time of slaughter are to provide that the premium is also to be granted when eligible animals are being dispatched to another Member State or being exported to a third country. The second paragraph of Article 42 contains no reference to these cases. Determining the allocation year does not raise any difficulties where animals are dispatched to another Member State as the aid application is submitted before the animal leaves the territory of the Member State concerned under the third subparagraph of Article 8(6) of that Regulation. However, where animals are exported to third countries, as the aid application may also be submitted after the animals leave Community customs territory, the scope of the second paragraph of Article 42 must be clarified.
(4) Under Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 the conversion into national currency of premium amounts and of the extensification payment is to be carried out in accordance with the average, calculated pro rata temporis, of the exchange rates applicable in the month of December preceding the allocation year determined in accordance with Article 42. It should be made clear that the exchange rate is fixed annually by the Commission, as in the case of the other common market organisations.
(5) Taking into account the difficulties encountered, the provision of this Regulation relating to the advance on premiums and on the additional payments should enter into force immediately. Moreover, in order to give producers and the competent authorities in the Member States time to adapt to the new rule, provision should be made for the deferred application of the rule relating to the rounding-off of the number of heifers. As regards the annual fixing of the exchange rate, its application should be made to coincide with the start of the next calendar year. Finally, in order to take into account the situation of exports carried out during the current year, the provision relating to the allocation year should apply retroactively.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1830/2002 of 14 October 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 2342/1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal as regards premium schemes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 2342/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular the third indent of Article 8(5), Article 9(2)(b) and Article 9(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Italy will host the universal exhibition named ‘EXPO Milano 2015’ which will take place in Milan from 1 May to 31 October 2015. The central theme of this exhibition is ‘Feeding the planet — Energy for life’.
(2) The authorisation to export products of animal origin to the Union is granted to third countries based on a number of requirements laid down in the Union legislation, which take into account animal and public health concerns. However, not all the products of animal origin from countries taking part in EXPO Milano 2015 are authorised to be introduced into the Union.
(3) Certain derogations to the Union import health requirements were therefore established by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/329 (2) in order to authorise the introduction of certain products of animal origin exclusively for the purpose of their use in EXPO Milano 2015.
(4) Japan is not listed in Annex II to Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 (3) as a third country from which the introduction into the Union of fresh meat of domestic porcine animals is authorised.
(5) Japan has requested to be authorised to introduce into the Union, exclusively for the purpose of their use in EXPO Milano 2015, fresh meat of domestic porcine animals and certain meat products and treated stomachs, bladders and intestines obtained from domestic porcine animals which have undergone the non-specific treatment ‘A’, as defined in Part 4 of Annex II to Decision 2007/777/EC.
(6) It is considered that those products of animal origin offer sufficient animal health guarantees in relation to their introduction in the Exhibition site of EXPO Milano 2015 as defined by Regulation (EU) 2015/329 for the following reasons. Japan duly reports outbreaks of diseases in animals to the World Organisation for Animal Health. African swine fever has never been reported in Japan, rinderpest has not been reported in Japan since 1922, swine vesicular disease not since 1975, classical swine fever not since 1992 and foot and mouth disease not since 2010. In addition, those products comply with the public health requirements of Japan and are fit for human consumption in Japan. Furthermore, EXPO Milano 2015 is a temporary event and Regulation (EU) 2015/329 provides for strict control measures for the products of animal origin which do not completely fulfil the health import requirements of the Union. That Regulation also ensures that those products are traceable in all stages of transport, storage, delivery and disposal of their remainder or waste and are to be used only for the purposes of the exhibition.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EU) 2015/329 with respect to the transit and storage requirements provided therein. In this context, a specific animal health import certificate model should be established for the introduction of such products. However, the other requirements set out in that Regulation should apply.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (1), and in particular Article 6(3) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Own Resources,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 371 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (2), certain Member States may continue to exempt certain transactions. These transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT own resources base.
(2) By virtue of Article 371 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Ireland may continue to exempt transactions listed in point 10 of Part B of Annex X to that Directive.
(3) Ireland has requested authorisation from the Commission to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base since it is unable to make the precise calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point 10 of Part B of Annex X to the VAT Directive. Such calculation is likely to involve an unjustified administrative burden in relation to the effect of these transactions on Ireland’s total VAT own resources base. Ireland is able to make a calculation using approximate estimates for this category of transactions.

Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2826/2000(2), and in particular Article 12a thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2768/98 of 21 December 1998 on the aid scheme for the private storage of olive oil(3), and in particular Article 1(2) thereof,

(1) The first paragraph of Article 12a of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, in order to regularise the market in the event of serious disturbance in certain regions of the Community, bodies offering sufficient guarantees and approved by the Member States may be authorised to conclude storage contracts for the olive oil they market.
(2) The third paragraph of Article 12a of that Regulation provides for aid to be granted for the performance of storage contracts. The aid may be granted by means of tenders.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2768/98 establishes detailed rules and conditions for invitation to tender.
(4) The Commission has noted that average market prices for olive oil in Spain and Greece over the period from 17 to 31 January 2001, which constitutes a representative period, are less than 95 % of the intervention price for the 1997/98 marketing year for virgin and extra virgin olive oil. The quantities of olive oil available are causing market disturbances that could be reduced by measures for the private storage of virgin and extra virgin olive oil in bulk.
(5) In order to determine the aid to be granted for the performance of contracts for the private storage of olive oil in bulk, an invitation to tender should be opened for a limited period for a maximum quantity of virgin and extra virgin olive oil.
(6) In view of the period covered by this tendering procedure and subject to market developments, in order to ensure that the measure is effective contracts need not and should not extend beyond the end of 2001.
(7) Article 12a of Regulation No 136/66/EEC lays down that priority should be given to producer groups and associations thereof recognised in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 952/97 of 20 May 1997 on producer groups and associations thereof(4).

","Council Decision
of 30 March 2004
authorising Germany to apply a measure derogating from Article 21 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes
(2004/290/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(1), and in particular Article 27(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a request submitted in the form of two letters addressed to the Commission, registered by the Commission's General-Secretariat on 1 September 2003 and 12 November 2003, the German Government sought authorisation to introduce three measures derogating from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC in order to prevent tax evasion and avoidance.
(2) Considerable value added tax (VAT) losses were established in the construction and in the building-cleaning businesses, where VAT was openly invoiced but not paid to the fiscal authorities, while the recipient exercised his right to deduct. The non-compliant operators could not be identified or identification was achieved too late to recover lost VAT. The number of such cases has increased to an extent requiring legal measures. The envisaged liability of the recipient for VAT only concerns businesses which can exercise their right to deduct and does not cover private persons. It is limited to two specific branches, where the losses in terms of VAT have achieved an intolerable dimension. A similar derogation has already been granted to Austria by Decision 2002/880/EC(2).
(3) VAT losses were also identified for supplies of immovable property pursuant to Article 13(B)(g) and (h), appearing particularly vulnerable to fraud and avoidance of VAT, where the supplier has exercised the option to make the supply taxable. Immovable property is a high-value good; thus the taxable amount and the losses in terms of VAT - even on one single transaction - are particularly high. The maintaining of the option to render a supply of immovable property taxable is necessary to keep the VAT system neutral. In the specific circumstances of the supply of immovable property, the envisaged liability of the recipient for VAT appears the most appropriate solution for addressing the particularly high risk involved. It avoids a double tax responsibility of supplier and recipient, which would involve a higher economic risk for the recipient and burdensome recovery procedures for the fiscal authorities, and prevents fiscal responsibility of a third person, like a notary, resulting in higher economic charges for suppliers and recipients. In practice the derogation will only cover supplies between taxable persons and is therefore limited to specific cases.
(4) The derogation does not affect the amount of value added tax due at the final consumption stage and has no impact on the Communities' own resources from VAT,","{'title': '2004/290/EC: Council Decision of 30 March 2004 authorising Germany to apply a measure derogating from Article 21 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 21(1)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC, as worded in Article 28(g) thereof, the Federal Republic of Germany is hereby authorised, with effect from 1 April 2004, to designate the recipients of the supplies of goods and services referred to in Article 2 of this Decision as the persons liable to pay VAT.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nIn the following instances the recipient of the supply of goods and services may be designated as the person liable to pay VAT:\n\n1. where building-cleaning services are supplied to a taxable person, except where the recipient of the supply exclusively rents not more than two residences or where construction work is supplied to a taxable person;\n\n2. where immovable property is supplied to a taxable person under Article 13(B)(g) and (h) and where the supplier has exercised his right to tax the supply.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 December 2008.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 March 2004.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nM.

The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 16244) as a feed additive for all animal species, to be classified in the additive category ‘technological additives’.
(4) It results from the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) of 3 February 2010 (2) that Pediococcus pentosaceus (DSM 16244) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that this preparation has the potential to improve the production of silage. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory established by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats (1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' arrival at destination.
(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(4) EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 of 5 July 2005 concerning the improvement of the trade arrangements for processed agricultural products provided in Protocol 3 of the Europe Agreement (4) provides for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Romania, from 1 December 2005.
(5) Romania has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into its territory only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds.
(6) In the light of those arrangements, as a transitory measure in view of the possible accession of Romania to the European Union and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.
(7) Since the measures laid down in EU-Romania Association Council Decision No 3/2005 will apply as from 1 December 2005 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.

DECISION No 1350/2008/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 16 December 2008
concerning the European Year of Creativity and Innovation (2009)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 149 and 150 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (3),
Whereas:
(1) Europe needs to strengthen its capacity for creativity and innovation for social and economic reasons in order to respond effectively to the development of the knowledge society: innovative capacity is closely linked with creativity as a personal attribute, and to be harnessed to full advantage it needs to be widely disseminated throughout the population. This requires an approach based on lifelong learning.
(2) Education and training systems should cater sufficiently and at all appropriate levels for the development of key competences to support creativity and innovation, with a view to finding innovative and original solutions in personal, occupational and social life.
(3) The Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 concluded that ‘a European framework should define the new basic skills to be provided through lifelong learning’ as a key measure in Europe's response to ‘globalisation and the shift to knowledge-based economies’, and emphasised that ‘people are Europe's main asset’.
(4) The Commission Communication of 21 November 2001 entitled ‘Making a European Area of Lifelong Learning a Reality’ and the subsequent Council Resolution of 27 June 2002 on lifelong learning (4) identified the provision of ‘the new basic skills’ as a priority and stressed that ‘lifelong learning must cover learning from pre-school age to that of post-retirement’.
(5) Recommendation 2006/962/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 on key competences for lifelong learning (5) identified various key competences, in particular, ‘mathematical competence and basic competences in science and technology’, ‘learning to learn’, ‘digital competence’, a ‘sense of initiative and entrepreneurship’, ‘cultural awareness and expression’ and ‘social and civic competences’.
(6) The Brussels European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007 noted that education and training are prerequisites for a well-functioning knowledge triangle (education-research-innovation) and play a key role in boosting growth and jobs. It called for particular attention to be given to stimulating the potential of small and medium-sized enterprises, including those in the cultural and creative sectors, in view of their role as drivers of growth, job creation and innovation.
(7) Declaring a European Year of Creativity and Innovation is an effective way of helping to meet the challenges facing Europe by raising public awareness, disseminating information about good practices and promoting research and policy debate. By creating an environment for simultaneously promoting these objectives at European, national, regional and local levels, it can achieve greater synergy and critical mass than disparate efforts at different levels.
(8) As the promotion of creativity and of a capacity for innovation through lifelong learning falls within the objectives of existing Community programmes, such a Year can be implemented by using those programmes within the existing margins which they provide for setting funding priorities on an annual or multi-annual basis; programmes and policies in other fields, such as culture, communication, enterprise, cohesion, rural development, research and the information society, also contribute to promoting creativity and a capacity for innovation and may support the initiative within their respective legal frameworks.
(9) Since the objective of this Decision, namely to support the efforts of the Member States to promote creativity, through lifelong learning, as a driver for innovation and as a key factor for the development of personal, occupational, entrepreneurial and social competences and the well-being of all individuals in society, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2009/827/EC (2) authorised, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 258/97, the placing on the market of Chia (Salvia hispanica) seed as a novel food ingredient to be used in bread products with a maximum content of 5 % Chia (Salvia hispanica) seeds.
(2) On 14 April 2011 The Chia Company made a request to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom for an extension of use of Chia seed on the market as a novel food ingredient. In particular, they asked to use up to 10 % Chia seed in certain food categories and to sell pre-packed Chia seed with a recommended daily intake of up to 15 g.
(3) On 16 March 2012, the competent food assessment body of the United Kingdom issued its initial assessment report. In that report it came to the conclusion that extending the use of Chia seeds for the proposed food categories meets the criteria set out in Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97.
(4) On 26 March 2012, the Commission forwarded the initial assessment report to all Member States.
(5) Reasoned objections were raised within the 60-day period laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 6(4) of Regulation (EC) No 258/97, in particular concerning the possible lack of toxicological data. Additional explanations by the applicant alleviated these concerns to the satisfaction of the Member States and the Commission.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1617/1999(2), and in particular Article 4 and Article 5(3) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank(3),
Whereas:
(1) By virtue of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each Member State is required to produce a harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) starting with the index for January 1997.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September 1996 on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(4), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1688/98(5), defines the coverage of the HICP as those goods and services which are included in household final monetary consumption expenditure and requires coverage of COICOP/HICP class 12.5.1 ""Financial services n.e.c."" in full by December 1999 without specific exclusion of charges expressed as a proportion of the transaction value.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2214/96 of 20 November 1996 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices: transmission and dissemination of subindices of the HICP(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1749/1999(7), requires a harmonised subindex for COICOP/HICP expenditure class 12.6.2 ""Other financial services n.e.c."" excluding interest payments and charges expressed as a proportion of the transaction value.
(4) There is considerable scope for non-comparability by excluding service charges that are expressed as a proportion of transaction values; a harmonised methodology for the treatment of such charges is necessary to ensure that the resulting HICPs meet the comparability requirement as laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95.
(5) The treatment of service charges that are expressed as a proportion of transaction values should be consistent with the treatment of goods and services in the health, education and social protection sectors as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2166/1999(8).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) A case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild boar and a number of outbreaks of that disease in livestock were confirmed in Bulgaria in January 2011. As a consequence, Bulgaria has taken measures in the framework of Council Directive 2003/85/EC of 29 September 2003 on Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (3).
(2) In addition, Commission Decision 2011/44/EU of 19 January 2011 concerning certain protection measures against foot-and-mouth disease in Bulgaria (4) was adopted, as it was necessary to reinforce the control measures taken by Bulgaria. That Decision is to apply until 30 June 2011.
(3) Annex I to Decision 2011/44/EU lists the areas in Bulgaria where cases of foot-and-mouth disease have been confirmed. The areas surrounding those areas are listed in Annex II to that Decision. The protection measures laid down in Decision 2011/44/EU differ depending on whether an area is listed in Annex I or in Annex II to that Decision.
(4) Annex I to Decision 2011/44/EU currently lists the region of Burgas and Annex II to that Decision lists the regions of Kardjali, Haskovo, Yambol, Sliven, Shumen and Varna.
(5) As no new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease have been reported in Bulgaria since 7 April 2011 and surveillance carried out in the areas listed in Annex I and Annex II has not revealed foot-and-mouth disease infection in domestic animals of species susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, it is appropriate to reduce the areas under restriction listed in Annexes I and II to Decision 2011/44/EU, respectively.
(6) However, surveillance in accordance with point 4(g) of Part B of Annex XVIII to Directive 2003/85/EC to rule out infection of wildlife with the foot-and-mouth disease virus cannot be completed until at least maternal antibodies have vanished in susceptible to foot-and-mouth disease wild animals born in that area after the first case of that disease was reported in January 2011.
(7) It is therefore necessary to prolong the application of the measures laid down in Decision 2011/44/EU until 30 September 2011.
(8) Decision 2011/44/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.7.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 173/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 29 June 2011\namending Decision 2011/44/EU concerning certain protection measures against foot-and-mouth disease in Bulgaria\n(notified under document C(2011) 4573)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2011/388/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) A case of foot-and-mouth disease in wild boar and a number of outbreaks of that disease in livestock were confirmed in Bulgaria in January 2011.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (1), and in particular, Article 57(2) thereof;
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal health and under certain circumstances to human health. There is a risk that the disease agent might be spread to other holdings thus reducing sharply the profitability of poultry farming, to wild birds and from one Member State to other Member States and third countries through the international trade in live birds or their products.
(2) Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H5N1 has been isolated from wild birds in certain parts of the Community and in third countries adjacent to the Community or populated by migratory birds during winter. The likelihood of virus introduction with wild birds is increasing during the forthcoming migratory season.
(3) Early detection systems and biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of transmission of avian influenza to poultry flocks are in place in France.
(4) In its opinion on ‘Animal health and welfare aspects of avian influenza’ of 20 September 2005 the Animal Health and Welfare Panel of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) recommends that preventive vaccination can be considered if a high risk of virus introduction is identified in densely populated poultry areas. However, such a practice should not jeopardise the strict biosecurity and other measures that should be in force in such areas aimed at eradicating any introduction of virus.
(5) On 21 February 2006, France has submitted to the Commission for approval a plan for preventive vaccination in the light of the particular risk of introduction of avian influenza in certain areas of its territory. The Commission has immediately examined this plan in collaboration with France and deems that after certain adaptations it is in conformity with the relevant Community provisions. It appears therefore appropriate to approve this plan.
(6) According to this plan France intends to vaccinate ducks and geese against highly pathogenic avain influenza H5N1. This should be considered as a ‘pilot project’ since there is limited experience with preventive vaccination in these species.
(7) Only vaccines authorised in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products (2) or Regulation No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (3) should be used.
(8) Where preventive vaccination is carried out in France monitoring on vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks and movement restrictions for vaccinated birds have to be implemented.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '25.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 55/51', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 24 February 2006\non introducing preventive vaccination against highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 and related provisions for movements in France\n(notified under document number C(2006) 632)\n(Only the French text is authentic)\n(2006/148/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal health and under certain circumstances to human health.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue(1), and in particular Article 8(2)(d) and (3), Article 9(1)(c) and Article 12(1), thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In the light of the evolution of the bluetongue situation in four Member States in 2001, Commission Decision 2001/783/EC of 9 November 2001 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and on rules applicable to movements of animals in and from those zones(2), as last amended by Decision 2002/906/EC(3), was adopted.
(2) It is clear from the results of the epidemiological survey carried out by Spain that the Balearic Islands are free of bluetongue and therefore, at the request of Spain, they should be deleted from Annex I B to Decision 2001/783/EC.
(3) As serotype 2 is the only serotype circulating in the provinces of Isernia and Aquila, it is appropriate that the epidemioloical situation of those two provinces be considered as equivalent to the one prevailing in Latium and Toscana. Therefore, at the request of Italy, those two provinces should be moved from Annex I A, which lists territories where serotypes 2 and 9 are circulating, to Annex I C which lists territories where only serotype 2 circulates.
(4) In 2002, during the activity period of the vector and following the vaccination campaigns the virus circulation has been as negligible in regions listed in Annex I B than in regions listed in Annex I C, therefore the two annexes should be agregated as they are now epidemiologically equivalent.
(5) Provision should be made for movements of animals to be slaughtered when the risk of contact between those animals and vectors may be ruled out from the point of entry in a non-restricted zone to the slaughterhouse.
(6) Decision 2001/783/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': '2003/14/EC: Commission Decision of 10 January 2003 amending Decision 2001/783/EC as regards the bluetongue protection and surveillance zones and conditions for movements of animals for immediate slaughter (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2002) 5562)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDecision 2001/783/EC is amended as follows:\n\n1. in Article 2 the fourth indent is deleted;\n\n2.

(Text with EEA relevance)

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (1), and in particular Article 5(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 17 November 2009 the Commission granted a mandate to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), whose tasks have been assumed by the European Securities and Markets Authority established on 1 January 2011 pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (2) (ESMA), requesting their advice with regard to the technical assessment of the legal and supervisory framework of Australia in respect of credit rating agencies.
(2) In its advice delivered on 18 April 2012, ESMA suggested that the Australian legal and supervisory framework in respect of credit rating agencies be considered equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.
(3) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, the fulfilment of three conditions needs to be assessed in order to consider a third country legal and supervisory framework equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.
(4) According to the first condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to authorisation or registration and subject to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis. The Australian legal and regulatory framework for credit rating agencies was introduced on 1 January 2010. All relevant laws and regulations, namely the Corporations Act (2001) and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) Act (2001), have entered into force. According to this regulatory framework, credit rating agencies have to be registered and are supervised on an ongoing basis by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The Australian legal and supervisory framework endows ASIC with sufficient powers to enable effective supervision and enforcement of credit rating agencies, including the power to sanction CRAs in breach of the applicable rules: ASIC can be warranted to seize books not produced by CRAs. On the basis of a search warrant granted by the competent judicial authority, ASIC has the power to search the premises of CRAs. In addition, ASIC is empowered by the Corporations Act to apply to a federal court for orders to cancel the licence of a credit rating agency. Following such cancellation of a licence, ASIC can apply to a court for orders to permanently prohibit the CRA from issuing credit ratings in Australia. Under the Corporations Act, ASIC may also apply for orders to stop unlawful behaviour by a CRA or impose fines where it has contravened any of its obligations under the relevant financial services legislation. The cooperation agreement concluded between ESMA and ASIC provides for information exchange with regard to enforcement and supervisory measures taken against cross border CRAs.
(5) According to the second condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to legally binding rules which are equivalent to those set out in Articles 6 to 12 and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. The Australian legal and supervisory framework meets the objectives of the EU regulatory framework for credit rating agencies in relation to conflicts-of-interest management. Conflicts-of-interest management is required by the Australian legislation (ASIC Act) including the obligation to manage conflicts of interest and organisational requirements, notably with regard to outsourcing, record keeping and confidentiality. With regard to corporate governance, the ASIC’s licence conditions require a CRA to be organised in a manner that ensures its business interest does not impair the independence and accuracy of its credit rating activities. The Australian framework also requires CRAs to establish a rigorous review function for rating methodologies and contains a wide range of disclosure requirements with regard to credit ratings and rating activities. Therefore, the Australian legal and supervisory framework meets the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 in respect of the management of conflicts of interest, the organisational processes and procedures that a credit rating agency needs to have in place, the quality of ratings and of rating methodologies, the disclosure of credit ratings and the general and periodic disclosure of credit rating activities. It thus provides for equivalent protection in terms of integrity, transparency, good governance of credit rating agencies and reliability of the credit rating activities.
(6) According to the third condition, the regulatory regime in the third country must prevent interference by the supervisory authorities and other public authorities of that third country with the content of credit ratings and methodologies. Any such interference with credit ratings and rating methodologies would be contrary to the objectives of Chapter 7 of the Australian Corporations Act of 2001 and ASIC’s objectives. Neither ASIC nor any other public authority is empowered to interfere with the content of credit ratings or credit rating methodologies.
(7) In view of the factors examined, the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 can be considered to be met by the Australian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies. Therefore, the Australian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies should be considered equivalent to the legal and supervisory framework established by Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. The Commission, in cooperation with ESMA, will continue monitoring the evolution of the Australian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies and the fulfilment of the conditions on the basis of which this decision has been taken.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,","{'header': '9.10.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 274/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 5 October 2012\non the recognition of the legal and supervisory framework of Australia as equivalent to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit rating agencies\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/627/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 17 November 2009 the Commission granted a mandate to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), whose tasks have been assumed by the European Securities and Markets Authority established on 1 January 2011 pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)(2)(ESMA), requesting their advice with regard to the technical assessment of the legal and supervisory framework of Australia in respect of credit rating agencies.\n\n((2)) In its advice delivered on 18 April 2012, ESMA suggested that the Australian legal and supervisory framework in respect of credit rating agencies be considered equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.\n\n((3)) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, the fulfilment of three conditions needs to be assessed in order to consider a third country legal and supervisory framework equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.\n\n((4)) According to the first condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to authorisation or registration and subject to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 of 30 June 1992 establishing a support system for producers of certain arable crops(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1624/98(2), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(1)(d) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 provides that the Commission is to calculate a final regional reference amount based on the observed reference price for oilseeds by substituting the observed reference price for the projected reference price. The Commission has determined the observed reference price using the data provided pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 3405/93(3).
(2) Article 5(1)(e) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 specifies that if the area of land for which the crop-specific oilseed compensatory payment is made, after application of Article 2(6) of that Regulation, exceeds the maximum guaranteed area (MGA), the final regional reference amounts must be reduced in accordance with Article 5(1)(f) and (g) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.
(3) The maximum guaranteed area was exceeded for the 1997/1998 and 1998/1999 marketing years but the information provided by the Member States, in particular the data forwarded in accordance with Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 658/96(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 610/1999(5), indicates that there has been no such overrun for the 1999/2000 marketing year. The Commission may accordingly decide, under Article 5(1)(h) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, that the final reference amounts for the following marketing year need not be reduced. It should therefore be decided not to apply the reduction for the 1999/2000 marketing year.
(4) The producers received an advance payment at the level set in Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1684/1999(6).
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Joint Meeting of Management Committees for cereals, oils and fats and dried fodder,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 550/2000 of 14 March 2000 setting the final reference amounts for producers of soya beans, rape or colza seed and sunflower seed for the 1999/2000 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 24 June 2004, Monsanto Europe S.A., submitted to the competent authorities of Germany an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xMON810 maize (the application).
(2) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of MON863xMON810 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with the provision of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 31 March 2006, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a favourable opinion in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xMON810 maize as described in the application (the ‘products’) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment (3). In its opinion, EFSA concluded that it was acceptable to use the data for the single events in support of the safety of the products and considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(4) In October 2006, upon request of the Commission, EFSA published detailed clarifications on how the comments of the competent authorities of the Member States had been taken into account in its opinion and also published further information on the different elements considered by the Scientific Panel on Genetically Modified Organisms of EFSA.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(6) On 26 February 2007, in the light of a report published by the World Health Organisation listing kanamycin and neomycin as ‘critically important antibacterial agents for human medicine and for risk management strategies of non-human use’, the European Medicines Agency issued a statement highlighting the therapeutic relevance of both antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine. On 13 April 2007, taking into account this statement, EFSA indicated that the therapeutic effect of the antibiotics at stake will not be compromised by the presence of the nptII gene in GM plants. This is due to the extremely low probability of gene transfer from plants to bacteria and its subsequent expression and to the fact that this antibiotic resistant gene in bacteria is already widespread in the environment. It thus confirmed its previous assessment of the safe use of the antibiotic resistance marker gene nptII in genetically modified organisms and their derived products for food and feed uses.
(7) On 14 May 2008, the Commission sent a mandate to EFSA, with a request: (i) to prepare a consolidated scientific opinion taking into account the previous opinion and the statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants intended or already authorised to be placed on the market and their possible uses for import and processing and for cultivation; (ii) to indicate the possible consequences of this consolidated opinion on the previous EFSA assessments on individual GMOs containing ARM genes. The mandate brought to the attention of EFSA , inter alia, letters by the Commission from Denmark and Greenpeace.
(8) On 11 June 2009, EFSA published a statement on the use of ARM genes in GM plants which concludes that the previous assessment of EFSA on MON863xMON810 maize is in line with the risk assessment strategy described in the statement, and that no new evidence has become available that would prompt EFSA to change its previous opinion.
(9) On 15 March 2007, following a scientific publication regarding a re-analysis of the MON 863 90-day rat study and questioning the safety of MON 863 maize, the Commission consulted EFSA on what impact this analysis study might have on its earlier opinion on MON 863 maize. On 28 June 2007, EFSA indicated that the publication does not raise new issues which are toxicologically relevant and confirmed its earlier favourable safety assessment on MON 863 maize.
(10) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(11) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(12) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xMON810 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(13) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(14) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs.
(15) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c), of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (6).
(16) The uses, other than food and feed, which were authorised for the same GMO under Commission Decision 2006/47/EC (7) as well as equivalent conditions for placing on the market and monitoring are included in this Decision and are therefore regulated only by this Decision.
(17) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health has not delivered an opinion within the time-limit laid down by its Chairman.
(18) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. It is accordingly for the Commission to adopt the measures,","{'header': '5.3.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 55/73', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 2 March 2010\nauthorising the placing on the market of products containing, consisting of, or produced from genetically modified maize MON863xMON810 (MON-ØØ863-5xMON-ØØ81Ø-6) pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document C(2010) 1198)\n(Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2010/140/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 24 June 2004, Monsanto Europe S.A., submitted to the competent authorities of Germany an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from MON863xMON810 maize (the application).\n\n((2)) The application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of MON863xMON810 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation.

Whereas on 30 April 1985 the Government of the United Kingdom forwarded a modification to the programme for the improvement of livestock marketing and the processing of livestock products in Scotland approved by Commission Decision 79/954/EEC (3), and on 4 September 1985 provided additional information;
Whereas this modification relates to the further modernization, rationalization and expansion of facilities for the marketing and processing of
- cattle, sheep and pigs
- poultry and eggs, as well as rabbits and game birds
- by products
- milk and milk products
- venison
and to the modernization and expansion of freezing facilities, cold stores, energy saving equipment and marketing facilities with the aim of adapting processing and marketing techniques to the needs of the market; whereas it therefore constitutes a programme within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77;
Whereas insofar as markets for the auctioning of livestock and the rationalization undertaken in the slaughterhouses are concerned, projects should be eligible for Community aid only where the facilities to be provided will result in the creation of more efficient units of optimum size;
Whereas in so far as the modification relates to milk and milk products, approval of the programme does not extend to that part which relates to the use of cows milk;
Whereas projects concerning the pet food industry may not be aided unless further information is provided to comply with the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1932/84 (4);
Whereas, in so far as the programme relates to the erection and modernization of cold stores, approval may extend only to the part which is connected with processing and marketing facilities and is not intended for the storage of intervention products;
Whereas the modification includes sufficient of the details listed in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, to show that the objectives listed in Article 1 of that Regulation can be achieved in the abovementioned sector; whereas the estimated time for implementation of the modification does not exceed the period laid down in Article 3 (1) (g) of the Regulation;

COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 9/2006
of 5 January 2006
fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.
(10) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'header': '6.1.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 3/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 9/2006\nof 5 January 2006\nfixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.\n\n((2)) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Italian Government submitted to the Commission on 27 November 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the region of Veneto fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The plan includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the other financial instruments proposed for implementing the plan.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The single programming document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(7) The Commission has satisfied itself that the single programming document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(8) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing Financial Instruments.
(9) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(10) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this single programming document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/726/EC: Commission Decision of 26 November 2001 approving the single programming document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Veneto in Italy (notified under document number C(2001) 2889)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Veneto in Italy eligible under Objective 2 for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2012/735/EU, the Council authorised the signature, on behalf of the Union, of the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other part (‘the Agreement’). Pursuant to Decision 2012/735/EU, the Agreement is to be applied on a provisional basis, pending the completion of the procedures for its conclusion. The Agreement applies on a provisional basis from 1 March 2013.
(2) Annex II to the Agreement concerns the definition of the concept of ‘originating products’ and methods of administrative cooperation. For a number of products, Appendix 2A and Appendix 5 to that Annex provide for derogations from the rules of origin set out in that Annex in the framework of annual quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down the conditions for the application of those derogations for imports from Peru.
(3) The quotas set out in Appendix 2A and Appendix 5 to Annex II to the Agreement should be managed by the Commission on a first-come, first-served basis in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (2).

The current measure, i.e. a duty in the form of a specific duty, does not cater for situations in which imported goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation.
3. Investigation
(4) The Commission officially advised exporting producers, the importers and the users known to be concerned and their associations, the representatives of the exporting countries concerned and the Community producers about the initiation of the proceeding. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the Notice of Initiation.
(5) A number of exporting producers in the countries concerned, as well as Community producers and Community importers/traders made their views known in writing. All parties who so requested within the time limit set above and who demonstrated that there were particular reasons why they should be heard were granted the opportunity to be heard.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of a determination of the appropriateness of the measures in force.
B. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(7) Article 145 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993(4) laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code foresees, for the determination of the customs value, an apportioning of the price actually paid or payable in situations where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation.
(8) In order to avoid that an excessive amount of anti-dumping duty is levied, the specific duty should, in case of damaged goods, be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable. According to the well-established rules set out by the Community Customs Code, the customs value is reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable.
(9) No interested party submitted any comments or arguments against this proposal.
(10) It is therefore concluded that in the absence of any substantiated argument from interested parties, in cases where goods have been damaged before entry into free circulation and, therefore, the price actually paid or payable is apportioned for the determination of the customs value, the specific duty shall be reduced by a percentage which corresponds to the apportioning of the price actually paid or payable,","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EC) No 155/2003 of 27 January 2003 amending the anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001 on imports of gas-fuelled, non-refillable pocket flint lighters originating in the People's Republic of China and Taiwan"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn Council Regulation (EC) No 1824/2001, Article 3 shall be replaced by the following text:\n\n""Article 3\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organization of the market in bananas (1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 3290/94 (2), and in particular Articles 16 (3), 20 and 30 thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1442/93 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1164/95 (4), lays down the detailed rules for applying the arrangements for importing bananas into the Community;
Whereas in August and September 1995 the tropical storms Iris, Luis and Marilyn caused severe damage to the banana plantations in the Community regions of Martinique and Guadeloupe and in the ACP States of Saint Vincent, Saint Lucia and Dominica; whereas the effects of these exceptional circumstances on production in the regions affected will be felt until July 1996 and will greatly affect imports and supplies to the Community markets during the first quarter of 1996; whereas this is likely to cause an appreciable increase in market prices in certain regions of the Community;
Whereas Article 16 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 stipulates that where necessary, in particular to take account of the effects of exceptional circumstances affecting production or import conditions, the forecast supply balance may be adjusted and, in such a case, the tariff quota is adapted;
Whereas the adaptation of the tariff quota must permit adequate supplies to the Community market during the first quarter of 1996 and provide compensation to operators who include or directly represent banana producers who suffered damage and who, in addition, in the absence of appropriate measures, risk losing their traditional outlets on the Community market on a long-term basis;

Whereas also, under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, the Community negotiated an agreement which provides for the implementation of a provision for the reallocation of supplies which is intended to overcome such exceptional circumstances and which will safeguard the interests of operators in the supplier countries which have suffered such damage; whereas this agreement applies from 1 January 1995;

(1) Sweden, acting in accordance with Article 143 of the Act of Accession, notified the Commission on 11 May 1995 of the aid scheme proposed under Article 142.
(2) The aid scheme was approved by Commission Decision 96/228/EC(1), as amended by Decision 97/557/EC(2).
(3) Sweden requested the Commission on 28 September 1998, 17 June 1999 and 25 January 2000 to amend certain aspects of Decision 96/228/EC and subsequently presented additional information in support of its requests.
(4) In the abovementioned letters Sweden asked that it be allowed to combine livestock units in pigmeat and egg sectors considering the number of production factors eligible for aid. This takes into account the annual fluctuations in the sectors concerned and would not lead to any increase in production.
(5) Sweden has requested that the maximum amount admissible for transport aid for cow's milk should be increased to correspond to the total amount of milk produced in the areas concerned by transfering a corresponding amount from the aid for cow's milk. This is in conformity with the principles of the aid scheme.
(6) The national authorities should have the necessary time to prepare the annual information to be supplied to the Commission.
(7) Decision 96/228/EC should be amended accordingly.

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754). The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) as a feed additive for weaned piglets, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1091/2009 (2).
(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) for weaned piglets. The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 16 June 2011 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that the use of that preparation can significantly increase the body weight gain and can improve feed to gain ratio in weaned piglets. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49755) and endo-1,3(4)-beta-glucanase produced by Trichoderma reesei (MULC 49754) shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 162(2) thereof,
Whereas the Treaty on European Union introduced a common foreign and security policy encompassing all matters relating to the security of the European Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common defence;
Whereas, under Article J.4 of the said Treaty, the Western European Union (WEU) is an integral part of the development of the European Union, which requests the WEU to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications;
Whereas, the common security policy of the Union may be developed further following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam; whereas, by virtue of Protocol No 1 on the new Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union, steps will be taken by the European Union to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the WEU;
Whereas, by virtue of Article J.9 of the Treaty on European Union, the Commission is fully associated with work carried out in the common foreign and security policy field; whereas the Commission accordingly receives and produces documents containing information of a sensitive nature the divulging of which might jeopardise the interests of the European Union, the Community and its Member States and those of international organisations such as the WEU and NATO;
Whereas, by Decision C(94) 3282 of 30 November 1994, the Commission adopted a decision on the security measures applicable to classified information produced or transmitted in connection with European Union activities;
Whereas, under Article 6(3) of the said Decision, information received from the WEU or NATO is governed by special rules;
Whereas the security rules must cover not only the physical protection of classified information held by the Commission but also the authorisation of officials and other servants of the Commission to have access to such information;
Whereas the procedure for authorising officials and other servants of the Commission who, by reason of their duties and for the requirements of the service, are required to have access to such information should be modified and such access restricted to authorised persons only;
Whereas decisions to grant authorisation will be taken only after security screening has been carried out by the competent national authorities of the Member States;
Whereas this Decision will be without prejudice to the rules governing public access to Commission information in the fields covered by the treaties establishing the European Communities, laid down in the Commission's Decision 94/90/ECSC, EC, Euratom (1);
Whereas this Decision is without prejudice to the specific security measures laid down in Council Regulation (Euratom) No 3 of 31 July 1958 implementing Article 24 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community (2);
Whereas, under Article 5 of the EC Treaty, Member States are required to facilitate the accomplishment by the institutions of the tasks incumbent on them by virtue of the Treaties; whereas it is therefore incumbent on the authorities of the Member States to cooperate with the Commission in order to maintain a high standard of protection and, accordingly, to carry out security screening as provided for in this Decision,","{'title': '1999/218/EC: Commission Decision of 25 February 1999 relating to the procedures whereby officials and employees of the European Commission may be allowed access to classified information held by the Commission (notified under document number C(1999) 423)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1569/1999 of 12 July 1999 on certain procedures for applying the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part(1), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Europea Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, acting within the framework of the European Union, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part(2), hereinafter referred to as ""the Agreement"", was signed in Luxembourg on 10 June 1996 and entered into force on 1 February 1999.
(2) Pending the entry into force of the Agreement, its provisions on trade and trade-related matters had been given effect by an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the Republic of Slovenia, of the other part(3), hereinafter referred to as ""the Interim Agreement"", since 1 January 1997.
(3) The Agreement stipulates that certain products originating in Slovenia may be imported into the Community, within the limits of tariff quotas or tariff ceilings, at a reduced or a zero rate of customs duty.
(4) Pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 428/97 of 5 March 1997, opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas and tariff ceilings for certain products originating in Slovenia and establishing the provisions for adapting these quotas and ceilings(4), the Commission has adopted implementing measures for these tariff quotas and ceilings on the basis of the Interim Agreement.
(5) Article 10(2) of the Agreement provides for the complete abolition of customs duties, from 1 January 2000, for imports into the Community of the industrial products which currently benefit from an exemption form customs duties in the framework of tariff ceilings.
(6) The Commission should adopt the implementing measures for the opening of the Community tariff quotas laid down in the Agreement, which continue to apply. These tariff quotas are annual and are repeated for an indeterminate period. The Agreement has already fixed the level of the increase of the tariff quota volumes.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1662/1999(6), has codified the management rules for tariff quotas designed to be used following the chronological order of dates of customs declarations.
(8) Particular care should be taken to ensure that all Community importers have equal and continuous access to the tariff quotas and that the rates laid down for the quotas are applied uninterruptedly to all imports of the products in question into all Member States until the quotas are exhausted. In order to ensure the efficiency of a common administration of these quotas, there is no obstacle to authorising the Member States to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports. However, this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quotas are used up and inform the Member States accordingly.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 428/97 should be repealed from 1 January 2000.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 of 15 December 1998 establishing agrimonetary arrangements for the euro(1), and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The maximum amounts of the compensatory aid resulting from the exchange rates for the pound sterling applicable on 31 December 2000 and 1 January 2001 are fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 653/2001(2).
(2) The maximum amount of the compensatory aid for the appreciable revaluation of the pound sterling in 2000 is fixed by Commission Regulation (EC) No 654/2001(3).
(3) As regards compensatory aid resulting from the exchange rates applicable for certain direct aid and structural or environmental measures, Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 lays down that the amounts paid out under the second and third tranches of aid are each to be reduced, vis-Ă -vis the level of the previous tranche, by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche, and Article 5(4) of that Regulation lays down that the maximum amount of the compensatory aid must be reduced or cancelled as a function of the effect on income of the development of the exchange rates recorded on the first day of the second and third tranches.

(5) For the United Kingdom, therefore, the third tranche of the compensatory aid whose operative events fall on 31 December 2000 and 1 January 2001 should be cancelled.
(6) As regards compensatory aid for appreciable revaluations of national currencies, Article 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2799/98 lays down that the amounts paid out under the second and third tranches are each to be reduced, vis-Ă -vis the level of the previous tranche, by at least a third of the amount paid out in the first tranche, and that the amounts paid out under the second and third tranches are to be reduced or cancelled as a function of the effect on incomes of the development of exchange rates recorded until the beginning of the month preceding the first month of the relevant tranche, and taking account of the market situation observed over the same period.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 on industrial emissions (integrated pollution prevention and control) (1), and in particular Article 32(5), second subparagraph thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 32(5) first subparagraph of Directive 2010/75/EU, Hungary submitted to the Commission its transitional national plan (TNP) by letter dated 18 December 2012, received by the Commission by e-mail on 28 December 2012 (2).
(2) During the assessment of the completeness of the TNP, the Commission found that for several plants included in the TNP essential data were missing, such as the date on which the first permit was granted, the amount of fuel used, the average annual waste gas flow rate and the reference oxygen content used in the calculations. In addition, some of the plants included in the TNP did not match with those reported by Hungary in its emission inventory submitted in 2010 under Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3).
(3) By letter of 12 June 2013 (4), the Commission requested the Hungarian authorities to provide the missing data at individual plant level, to clarify the grounds for including one particular plant in the TNP and to resolve the discrepancies between the TNP and the emission inventory under Directive 2001/80/EC.
(4) By e-mail of 25 June 2013 (5), Hungary submitted the requested additional information and clarifications.
(5) After further assessment of the TNP and the additional information, the Commission sent a second letter to Hungary on 13 September 2013 (6) with a request to confirm the correct implementation of the aggregation rules set out in Article 29 of Directive 2010/75/EU and to clarify how the average annual waste gas flow rate was determined and how the contribution to the TNP ceilings was calculated for the plants which had undergone an extension during the reference period 2001-2010. The Commission also asked for clarification of the grounds for applying certain emission limit values for two plants.
(6) By e-mail of 23 September 2013 (7), Hungary informed the Commission that one plant had been removed from the TNP and confirmed the correct application of the aggregation rules set out in Article 29 of Directive 2010/75/EU to the remaining plants. Hungary also clarified the method used for calculating the waste gas flow rate per fuel type, provided justification for applying specific emission limit values and corrected certain erroneous data.
(7) By letter of 4 October 2013 (8), the Commission requested further clarification of the data and methodology used for calculating the average annual waste gas flow rate for five plants, and Hungary provided such information by letter of 10 October 2013 (9). After assessing the data provided and finding remaining inconsistencies for two plants, the Commission, by letter of 15 October 2013 (10), requested the Hungarian authorities to further verify the calculations for those plants.
(8) By letter of 18 October 2013 (11), Hungary provided the corrected data for the average annual waste gas flow rate for the two plants concerned, as well as an explanation thereon, in conformity with Commission Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU (12).
(9) The TNP has therefore been assessed by the Commission in accordance with Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and with Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.
(10) In particular, the Commission has examined the consistency and correctness of the data, the assumptions and calculations used for determining the contributions of each of the combustion plants covered by the TNP to the emission ceilings set out in the TNP, and has analysed whether the TNP contains objectives and related targets, measures and timetables for reaching these objectives and a monitoring mechanism to assess future compliance.
(11) Further to the additional information submitted, the Commission found that the emission ceilings for the years 2016 and 2019 were calculated using the appropriate data and formulae and that the calculations were correct. Hungary has provided sufficient information regarding the measures that will be implemented in order to achieve the emission ceilings, the monitoring and the reporting to the Commission on the implementation of the TNP.
(12) The Commission is satisfied that the Hungarian authorities have taken into consideration the provisions listed in Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and in Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU.
(13) The implementation of the TNP should be without prejudice to other applicable national and Union law. In particular, by setting individual permit conditions for the combustion plants covered by the TNP, Hungary should ensure that compliance with the requirements set out in, inter alia, Directive 2010/75/EU, Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) and Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (14) is not jeopardised.
(14) Article 32(6) of Directive 2010/75/EU requires Hungary to inform the Commission of any subsequent changes to the TNP. The Commission should assess whether those changes comply with the provisions laid down in Article 32(1), (3) and (4) of Directive 2010/75/EU and in Implementing Decision 2012/115/EU,","{'header': '6.2.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 36/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 4 February 2014\non the notification by Hungary of a transitional national plan referred to in Article 32 of Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on industrial emissions\n(notified under document C(2014) 502)\n(Only the Hungarian text is authentic)\n(2014/57/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 32(5) first subparagraph of Directive 2010/75/EU, Hungary submitted to the Commission its transitional national plan (TNP) by letter dated 18 December 2012, received by the Commission by e-mail on 28 December 2012(2).\n\n((2)) During the assessment of the completeness of the TNP, the Commission found that for several plants included in the TNP essential data were missing, such as the date on which the first permit was granted, the amount of fuel used, the average annual waste gas flow rate and the reference oxygen content used in the calculations.

concerning aid for fuel granted by the Italian Government to fishermen operating in the Mediterranean

(83/312/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 of 19 January 1976 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3443/80 (2), and in particular Article 26 thereof, and to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 (3), which replaced Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 with effect from 1 June 1982, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having given notice, in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2), to the parties concerned to submit their comments, and having regard to these comments,
I
Whereas, in accordance with Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty, the Italian Government notified the Commission by letter dated 28 March 1980 from its Permanent Representation to the European Communities of the text of Law No 57 of 29 February 1980 introducing extraordinary assistance for sea fishing, under which commercial fishermen operating in the Mediterranean were to be granted exceptional aid towards running costs for 1980 only; whereas this Law took effect from 13 April 1980; whereas the detailed rules for implementing this Law were to be laid down by Ministerial Decree, the draft of which was notified to the Commission, under Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, by letter dated 13 May 1980;
Whereas it is clear from this Decree that the aid in question was directly linked to the consumption of fuel; whereas it amounted to Lit 87 for each kilogram of fuel used and the sum set aside for the purpose was Lit 25 000 million;
Whereas the aid described above falls within the scope of Articles 92 to 94 of the EEC Treaty by virtue of the Articles of Regulations (EEC) No 100/76 and (EEC) No 3796/81 referred to above;
Whereas, following initial scrutiny, the Commission took the view that the aid in question constituted operating aid granted with no actual reciprocal commitment on the part of the beneficiaries, that it had a substantial direct impact on competition and trade between the Member States and that it was therefore incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty; whereas it accordingly decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the above aid and, to this effect, by letter of 22 July 1980, gave the Italian Government formal notice to submit its comments;
Whereas, in November 1981, the Commission learned that the Italian Government had decided to continue this aid in 1981; whereas, after being asked twice, on 17 November and 22 December 1981, to confirm this information, the Italian Government, by letter dated 11 January 1982, notified Decree-Law No 193 of 11 May 1981 extending the aid in question for the first half of 1981;
Whereas the basic terms for granting the aid had not been changed but the rate had risen to Lit 150 per kilogram of fuel used for the first quarter of 1981 and Lit 140 per kilogram of fuel used for the second quarter of 1981;
Whereas the sum set aside for this aid for the first half of 1981 alone was Lit 21 000 million;
Whereas, on the grounds that this amounted to a renewal of the aid granted in 1980, the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the above aid, and, to this effect, by letter of 24 February 1982, gave the Italian Government formal notice to submit its comments;
Whereas it follows from the above that the Italian Government clearly failed in its obligations under Article 93 (3) of the EEC Treaty;
II
Whereas, in its replies to the letters giving notice sent to the Commission on 13 August 1980 and 24 March 1982, the Italian Government gave the following reasons for granting aid for fuel in 1980 and 1981: social reasons, the need to end discrimination between Sicilian fishermen already in receipt of aid for fuel, accepted by the Commission with certain provisos, and fishermen elsewhere, the fact that implementation did not distort competition between the Member States, its temporary nature, the absence of other measures in favour of sea fishing and, lastly, the low level of the aid, namely 30 % of the fuel price;
Whereas several Member States and several sectoral organizations have submitted their comments to the Commission; whereas certain Member States and sectoral organizations share the Commission's view; whereas other Member States feel that the absence of a common fisheries policy may lead Member States to introduce aids to prevent the current situation from deteriorating; whereas several sectoral organizations would like to see the granting of fisheries aids harmonized within the Community;
III
Whereas the subsidy of Lit 87 for each kilogram of fuel used, provided for in Article 7 of the Ministerial Decree laying down detailed rules for implementing Law No 57 of 29 February 1980, and the subsidy of Lit 150 for each kilogram of fuel used for the first quarter of 1981 and Lit 140 for each kilogram of fuel used for the second quarter of 1981, provided for in Article 2 of the Ministerial Decree of 25 July 1981, have had a direct impact on the production costs of recipients and have given them a definite advantage over the other Community fishermen;
Whereas the comparison made by the Italian Government with the Sicilian aid does not appear relevant, firstly because the existence of an aid scheme somewhere in the Community can never be taken as justification for granting similar aid elsewhere, and secondly because the Commission's decision to authorize aid for fuel for Sicilian fishermen on a temporary basis, until 30 June 1980, was based on the low volume of trade in fishery products between Sicily and the rest of the Community, which is not the case for the rest of Italy; whereas, moreover, the Commission decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of the extension of the Sicilian aid for the second half of 1980, and for 1981 and 1982, notably because of the sharp increase in Sicilian exports to the other Community countries and because of the fact that, by virtue of its continued extension, the aid in question amounted to a permanent scheme;
Whereas the aid in question amounted to 40 % of the price of fuel in January 1980;
Whereas intra-Community trade in fishery products for human consumption is substantial and accounts for approximately 30 % of total landings for human consumption in the Community as a whole; whereas, for its part, the Italian market receives approximately 60 % of its requirements from the landings made by its own fishermen, approximately 30 % from imports from non-member countries and approximately 10 % from imports from the other Member States, and Italy exports 20 % of its production, half of which goes to the other Member States;
Whereas, moreover, for a number of years all Community fishermen have been faced with a very sharp increase in the price of fuel; whereas competition on the Community market in fishery products is very keen;
IV
Whereas it follows from the above that the aid introduced by the Italian Government is likely to affect trade between the Member States and to distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty; Whereas Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty states that aids fulfilling the criteria laid down therein are incompatible in principle with the common market; whereas exceptions to this incompatibility, which are the only exceptions relevant to the case in point, are set out in paragraph 3 of the said Article and lay down the objectives followed in the Community's interest and not only in the interest of individual sectors of the national economy; whereas these exceptions are to be strictly interpreted when scrutinizing any aid programme of a regional or sectoral nature or any individual case of application of general aid schemes; whereas exceptions can be allowed only in cases where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary for achievement of one of the objectives set out in these provisions;
Whereas to allow such exceptions in respect of aids which do not offer such a compensatory advantage would amount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without justification on grounds of Community interest and would result in unfair advantages for certain Member States;
Whereas it has not been possible to establish the existence of such a compensatory advantage in the case in point; whereas the Italian Government was unable to provide any evidence, and the Commission could fine none, that the aids in question fulfilled the conditions required for allowing one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty;
Whereas the aid in question is clearly not designed to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas; whereas, on regional criteria, Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) is accordingly inapplicable;
Whereas such aids constitute neither an important project of common European interest nor measures capable of remedying a serious disturbance in the Italian economy; whereas Article 92 (3) (b) of the Treaty is accordingly inapplicable;
Whereas aid for the purchase of fuel, intended as it is to reduce the cost of certain inputs, constitutes an operating aid with no lasting impact on the economic situation of the recipients; whereas, in general, the Commission has always been opposed to such aid, since, as a rule, such aid does not in itself fulfil the conditions for eligibility for the exception provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) of the EEC Treaty, since it is not likely to facilitate the development of certain activities within the meaning of that provision;
Whereas, in its communication to the Council of 25 May 1978 on sectoral aid policy, the Commission made it clear that temporary aids to mitigate the social consequences of a crisis situation must be linked with restructuring objectives for the sector in question and subject to action by recipients to facilitate conversion; whereas this does not apply in the case of the aid in question;

Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular the fourth subparagraph of Article 8(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I of that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the second and third stages of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) Monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate and dimethipin are substances designated in the third stage programme.
(4) The sole notifiers for monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate and dimethipin informed the Commission on 29 May 2006 and 6 July 2006 respectively, that they no longer wished to participate in the programme of work for these active substances, and therefore further information will not be submitted. As a consequence, these active substances should not be included in the Annex I of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(5) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate or dimethipin are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed, and that no authorisations for such products are granted.
(6) For these active substances for which there is only a short period of advance notice for the withdrawal of plant protection products containing such substances, it is reasonable to provide for a period of grace for disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks for a period no longer than 12 months to allow existing stocks to be used in no more than one further growing. In cases where a longer advance notice period is provided, such period can be shortened to expire at the end of the growing season.
(7) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for monocarbamide dihydrogensulphate or dimethipin according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.

(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 2200/90 (2), the Council imposed definitive anti-dumping measures in the form of a fixed duty per tonne of silicon originating in the People’s Republic of China (China) imported into the Community.
(2) Shortly thereafter, following a request lodged by the Community industry, the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 1607/92 (3), concluded that the anti-dumping measures in force had been absorbed by Chinese exporters and imposed an additional duty on imports of silicon originating in China.
(3) In 1997, both expiry and interim reviews were initiated. These reviews were concluded by Council Regulation (EC) No 2496/97 (4). As a result of these reviews, measures were maintained but it was considered more appropriate to change the form of the measures from a fixed duty to an ad valorem duty. The duty rate amounted to 49 % of the cif price of the imports in question. In accordance with the lesser duty rule, this rate corresponded to the injury margin.
(4) Following an expiry review, the Council concluded by Regulation (EC) No 398/2004 (5) that the anti-dumping duty should be maintained.
2.   Request
(5) On 6 March 2006, the Commission received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of silicon, classifiable within CN code 2804 69 00 (silicon content less than 99,99 % by weight) originating in China. The request was submitted by Euroalliages (Liaison Committee of the Ferro-Alloy Industry) (the applicant) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion, namely 100 %, of the Community production of silicon. The request alleged that the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of silicon originating in China were being circumvented by means of transhipment via the Republic of Korea (Korea).
(6) The request further alleged that there was insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of anti-dumping measures for such change in the pattern of trade and that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping measures were being undermined both in terms of quantity and price. Significant volumes of imports of silicon from Korea appeared to have replaced imports of silicon from China. In addition, there was sufficient evidence that these imports were made at prices below the cost of production and reasonable profit established for the Community industry in the investigation that led to the existing measures.
(7) Finally, the applicants alleged that the prices of silicon consigned from Korea were dumped in relation to the normal value previously established for silicon originating in China.
3.   Initiation
(8) Having determined, after consulting the Advisory Committee, that sufficient prima facie evidence existed for the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the basic Regulation, the Commission initiated an investigation by Regulation (EC) No 607/2006 (6) (the initiating Regulation). Pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission, by the initiating Regulation, also directed the customs authorities to register imports of silicon consigned from Korea, whether declared as originating in Korea or not.
4.   Investigation
(9) The Commission officially advised the authorities of China and Korea, the producers/exporters and the importers in the Community known to be concerned as well as the applicant Community industry of the initiation of the investigation. Questionnaires were sent to the producers/exporters in Korea and to the Chinese and Korean authorities. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set in the initiating Regulation. All parties were informed that non-cooperation might lead to the application of Article 18 of the basic Regulation and to findings being made on the basis of the facts available.
(10) No questionnaire replies were received from exporters/producers in China, nor did the Commission receive any comments from the Chinese authorities.
(11) Two Korean companies offered to cooperate in the investigation. Only one of these imported silicon from China into Korea, but did not export it to the Community. The second cooperating Korean company neither produced nor imported silicon at all.
5.   Investigation Period
(12) The investigation period covered the period from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006 (the IP). Data was collected from 2001 up to the end of the IP to investigate the alleged change in the pattern of trade.
B.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1.   General considerations/degree of cooperation
(13) As mentioned in recital 10, no producers/exporters of silicon in China cooperated in the investigation nor did any Community importer submit information relevant for the investigation. As mentioned in recital 11, only two companies in Korea cooperated but they did not export silicon to the Community during the period considered. Accordingly, findings in respect of silicon consigned from Korea to the Community had to be made on the basis of the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation.
2.   Product concerned and like product
(14) The product concerned is the same as in the original investigation, i.e. silicon originating in China classifiable within CN code 2804 69 00 (silicon content less than 99,99 % by weight). It is recalled that silicon with a higher purity, that is containing by weight not less than 99,99 % of silicon, used mostly in the electronic semi-conductor industry, falls under a different CN code and is not covered by this proceeding.
(15) From the information received from the two cooperating Korean companies as well as information available in the request submitted by the applicant, it was concluded that silicon exported to the Community from China and silicon consigned from Korea to the Community have the same basic physical characteristics and the same uses. Therefore, they are considered as like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic Regulation. No submissions to the contrary were made during the investigation.
3.   Change in the pattern of trade between third countries and the Community
(16) As stated above, the change in the pattern of the trade was alleged to stem from transhipment via Korea.
(17) Due to the absence of cooperation from Korean exporting companies, the volume and value of Korean exports of the product concerned to the Community were determined on the basis of the information available, which in this case was Eurostat import statistics.
(18) The change in the pattern of trade is based on data from the first table reproduced below. Large volumes of silicon started to be imported from Korea into the Community in 2002 and 2003, and continued at a high level until the IP. The significant volumes of imports consigned from Korea between, in particular, 2003 and the IP, while fluctuating during this period, coincided with a substantial and continuing reduction (more than 50 %) of imports from China.
Country 2002 2003 2004 2005 IP (April 2005-March 2006)
China 39 705 56 226 55 939 30 346 22 358
Korea 1 070 5 540 2 340 4 380 3 658
Source: Eurostat.
4.   Circumvention process found and insufficient due cause or economic justification
(19) Since no Korean company which exported silicon to the EU cooperated in the present investigation, the assessment of circumvention was based on information available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, including information provided in the complaint. The investigation did not reveal information suggesting that that silicon was produced in Korea. On the contrary, both Korean cooperating companies confirmed that no production of silicon exists in Korea.
(20) It is therefore concluded that, in the absence of any other sufficient due cause or economic justification within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the change in the pattern of trade stemmed from the anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of silicon originating in China and must be assumed, as the complainant states, to consist in transhipment through Korea.
5.   Undermining of the remedial effects of the duty in terms of the prices and/or the quantities of the like product
(21) It is evident from the data mentioned in recital 18 that a quantitative change in the pattern of Community imports of the product concerned occurred and that Chinese imports into the Community decreased significantly in 2005, while at the same time there was a surge of exports of the product concerned to the Community from Korea, a country where there is no production of silicon. It is therefore clear that the marked change in trade flows undermined the remedial effects of the measures in terms of the quantities imported into the Community market even if the imports from Korea during the IP amounted to significantly less than the reduction of imports from China between 2004 and the IP.
(22) With regard to prices of silicon consigned from Korea, in the absence of cooperation, it was necessary to refer to Eurostat data. It was found that the average export prices from Korea to the Community were far below the sale prices and the costs of the Community industry as established in the investigation which led to the imposition of the current measures.
Country 2002 2003 2004 2005 IP (April 2005-March 2006)
China 1 063 1 000 1 026 964 1 001
Korea 1 031 912 961 1 039 1 061
Source: Eurostat.
(23) It is therefore concluded that the imports of the product concerned from Korea undermine the remedial effects of the duty both in terms of quantities and prices.
6.   Evidence of dumping in relation to the normal value previously established for the like product
(24) As explained in recitals 10 and 11, given the absence of cooperation and in order to determine whether evidence of dumping could be found with respect to the exports of the product concerned to the Community from Korea during the IP, Eurostat data at CN level were used pursuant to Article 18 of the basic Regulation as the basis for establishing export prices to the EU.
(25) In accordance with Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, these export prices were compared with the normal value previously established, in this case the normal value established in the most recent expiry review.
(26) In accordance with Article 2(11) and 2(12) of the basic Regulation, a comparison of the weighted average normal value as established during the expiry review investigation and the weighted average of export prices during this investigation’s IP, expressed as a percentage of cif price at the Community frontier duty unpaid, confirmed significant dumping.
C.   MEASURES
(27) In view of the findings above it is found that circumvention has taken place within the meaning of the second sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation. In accordance with the first sentence of Article 13(1) of the basic Regulation, the existing anti-dumping measures on imports of the product concerned originating in China, should be extended to imports of the same product consigned from Korea, whether declared as originating in Korea or not.
(28) The measures to be extended should be the ones established in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 398/2004, which are a definitive anti-dumping duty of 49 % applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before customs duty.
(29) In accordance with Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation, which provides that any extended measure should apply to imports which entered the Community under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation, duties should be collected on those registered imports of silicon consigned from Korea.
D.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION
(30) Although during this investigation no genuine producer/exporter of silicon to the Community was found to exist in Korea or made itself known to the Commission, any exporters concerned which consider lodging a request for an exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty pursuant to Article 13(4) of the basic Regulation will be required to complete a questionnaire in order to enable the Commission to determine whether an exemption may be warranted. Such exemption may be granted after the assessment of the market situation of the product concerned, production capacity and capacity utilisation, procurement and sales and the likelihood of continuation of practices for which there is insufficient due cause or economic justification and the evidence of dumping. The Commission would normally also carry out an on the spot verification visit. The request should be addressed to the Commission forthwith, with all relevant information, in particular any modification in the company’s activities linked to production and sales.
(31) Where an exemption is warranted, the Commission will, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, propose the amendment of this Regulation accordingly. Subsequently, any exemption granted will be monitored to ensure compliance with the conditions set therein.
E.   PROCEDURE
(32) Interested parties were informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the Council intended to extend the definitive anti-dumping duty in force and were given the opportunity to comment and to be heard.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 20 June 2014
abrogating Decision 2010/287/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands
(2014/407/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 2 December 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Council Decision 2010/287/EU (1), that an excessive deficit existed in the Netherlands. The Council noted that the general government deficit planned for 2009 was 4,8 % of GDP, thus above the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value while the general government gross debt was planned to reach 59,7 % of GDP in 2009, thus below the 60 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value. The general government deficit and debt for 2009 were subsequently revised to 5,6 % and 60,8 % of GDP, respectively.
(2) On 2 December 2009, in accordance with Article 126(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 (2), the Council, based on a recommendation from the Commission, addressed a recommendation to the Netherlands with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2013 at the latest. That Council recommendation was made public.
(3) On 21 June 2013, the Council considered that the Netherlands had taken effective action in compliance with Council recommendation of 2 December 2009 under Article 126(7) of the Treaty and that unexpected adverse economic events with major unfavourable consequences for government finances had occurred after the adoption of the original recommendation. Therefore, the Council, following a recommendation from the Commission, considered that the conditions foreseen in Article 3(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 were fulfilled and issued a new recommendation to the Netherlands under Article 126(7) of the Treaty, with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2014. That new Council recommendation was made public.
(4) In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of that Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (3).
(5) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit ought to be abrogated, the Council is to take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon (4).
(6) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, following the notification by the Netherlands before 1 April 2014, the 2014 stability programme and the Commission services 2014 spring forecast the following conclusions are justified:
— Having peaked at 5,6 % of GDP in 2009, the Netherland's general government deficit was steadily brought down and reached 2,5 % of GDP in 2013 (5). This improvement was driven by consolidation measures on both the expenditure and the revenue side, in particular by increases in (indirect) taxation and cuts in public expenditure.
— The 2014 stability programme of the Netherlands projects the general government deficit to increase to 2,9 % of GDP in 2014 and to decrease to 2,1 % of GDP in 2015, while the Commission services 2014 spring forecast projects the general government deficit to reach 2,8 % of GDP in 2014 and 1,8 % of GDP in 2015. Thus, the deficit is set to remain below the 3 %-of-GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon.
— After having improved by 1,4 % of GDP in 2013, the structural balance, that is the general government balance adjusted for the economic cycle and net of one-off and other temporary measures, is forecast to stabilise in 2014 and to improve by 0,5 percentage points in 2015, based on a no-policy-change assumption. In that context, it appears that there is currently an emerging gap of 0,5 % of GDP relative to the required adjustment of the structural balance towards the medium-term budgetary objective (MTO) in 2014, suggesting that there is a need to reinforce the budgetary measures in order to ensure full compliance with the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact in view of the emerging risk of a significant deviation from the required adjustment path.
— The debt-to-GDP ratio increased by around 10 percentage points between 2010 and 2013 to 73,5 %. The Commission services 2014 spring forecast projects the general government gross debt to increase further to 73,8 % of GDP in 2014 and to decrease to 73,4 % of GDP in 2015.
(7) Starting from 2014, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, the Netherlands is subject to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and should progress towards its MTO at an appropriate pace, including by respecting the expenditure benchmark, and make sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt criterion in accordance with Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97.
(8) In accordance with Article 126(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(9) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in the Netherlands has been corrected and Decision 2010/287/EU should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '28.6.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 190/73', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 20 June 2014\nabrogating Decision 2010/287/EU on the existence of an excessive deficit in the Netherlands\n(2014/407/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 2 December 2009, following a recommendation from the Commission, the Council decided, in Council Decision 2010/287/EU(1), that an excessive deficit existed in the Netherlands.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Articles 134 and 148 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 (2) draws a distinction between traditional and new importers in respect of traders that may apply for import licences for garlic under the tariff quotas that are opened and administered under that Regulation.
(2) In order to ensure fair opportunities to all traders concerned, it is appropriate to enlarge the category of importers to include certain exporters of garlic to third countries within the categories of traders who may apply for import licences under the tariff quota system.
(3) The amount of the security referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 1(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 376/2008 of 23 April 2008 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (3) should be fixed at an appropriate level of 5 % of the additional duty applicable to importers of garlic, namely EUR 60 per tonne.
(4) Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 provides that the reference quantities of traditional importers are calculated on the basis of maximum quantities of garlic imported during previous calendar years or import tariff quota periods. In order to avoid that these reference quantities are calculated on the basis of historic data which no longer reflect a genuine economic activity, it is appropriate to provide that the reference quantity should be the average of the quantities of garlic actually imported by a traditional importer during the three years which preceded the related import tariff quota period.
(5) In order to ensure efficient market management, it is appropriate to provide for a time period during which applications for ‘A’ licences may be lodged which would be chronologically close to the subperiod for which the applications are lodged.
(6) For the purpose of improving control and in order to allow a rapid reaction from the competent authorities in case of errors or malfunctioning of the system, the Member States should notify the Commission of the quantities for which licence applications have been lodged for the relevant subperiod.
(7) The reference to working days when calculating the time periods could lead to different situations among the Member States. It is therefore appropriate to use calendar days instead.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 341/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) This Regulation should apply from 1 May 2010.

In order to avoid that these reference quantities are calculated on the basis of historic data which no longer reflect a genuine economic activity, it is appropriate to provide that the reference quantity should be the average of the quantities of garlic actually imported by a traditional importer during the three years which preceded the related import tariff quota period.\n\n((5)) In order to ensure efficient market management, it is appropriate to provide for a time period during which applications for ‘A’ licences may be lodged which would be chronologically close to the subperiod for which the applications are lodged.\n\n((6)) For the purpose of improving control and in order to allow a rapid reaction from the competent authorities in case of errors or malfunctioning of the system, the Member States should notify the Commission of the quantities for which licence applications have been lodged for the relevant subperiod.\n\n((7)) The reference to working days when calculating the time periods could lead to different situations among the Member States.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.

Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (2), and in particular Article 8(1) and (4),
Whereas:
(1) Part 1 of Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1979 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat (3) sets out a list of third countries and parts of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import certain live animals and their fresh meat.
(2) Following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (‘FMD’) that occurred in September 2003 in Argentina in the province of Salta, in the north of the country close to the border with Paraguay, Commission Decision 93/402/EEC of 10 June 1993 concerning animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from South American countries (4) was amended by Decisions 2003/658/EC (5) and 2003/758/EC (6), in order to suspend importation of deboned and matured bovine meat from the Argentinean provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chaco and Formosa. Decision 93/402/EEC has been repealed by Decision 2004/212/EC (7) and its provisions have been incorporated in Decision 79/542/EEC.
(3) The outbreak has been closed for more than 12 months and no new outbreaks have been detected in the territory of Argentina. In the meantime, inspection missions carried out in 2004 have shown that the situation in Argentina has improved in regard to both animal and public health.
(4) The Commission requested Argentina to provide for a buffer zone along its borders with Bolivia and Paraguay in order to avoid the risk of introduction of FMD. Argentina proposed a zone with a width of 25 kilometres along its border with those countries (‘the buffer zone’). Detailed maps and information, in particular concerning control measures in place in the buffer zone, have now been provided to the Commission. Importation into the Community from the buffer zone of fresh meat from species susceptible to FMD should be prohibited.
(5) It is therefore appropriate to resume importation of deboned and matured bovine fresh meat from the provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chaco and Formosa with the exception of the buffer zone.
(6) Decision 79/542/EEC has been amended by Decision 2004/212/EC inter alia in order to exclude meat products from its scope. It is therefore appropriate to delete in Article 1 the erroneous reference to meat products.
(7) Article 1 and Part 1 of Annex II to Decision 79/542/EEC should be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '18.3.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 72/35', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 March 2005\namending Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC as regards imports of fresh meat from Argentina\n(notified under document number C(2005) 602)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/234/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Part 1 of Annex II to Council Decision 79/542/EEC of 21 December 1979 drawing up a list of third countries or parts of third countries, and laying down animal and public health and veterinary certification conditions, for importation into the Community of certain live animals and their fresh meat(3)sets out a list of third countries and parts of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import certain live animals and their fresh meat.\n\n((2)) Following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (‘FMD’) that occurred in September 2003 in Argentina in the province of Salta, in the north of the country close to the border with Paraguay, Commission Decision 93/402/EEC of 10 June 1993 concerning animal health conditions and veterinary certification for imports of fresh meat from South American countries(4)was amended by Decisions 2003/658/EC(5)and 2003/758/EC(6), in order to suspend importation of deboned and matured bovine meat from the Argentinean provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Chaco and Formosa.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For potassium iodide the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2005/751/EC (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the Netherlands received on 6 September 2004 an application from Koppert Beheer BV for the inclusion of the active substance potassium iodide in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2005/751/EC confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 27 July 2007. In accordance with Article 11(6) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 188/2011 (4) additional information was requested from the applicant. The applicant informed on 30 May 2011 that no additional information was available.
(4) The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance potassium iodide (5) on 22 October 2012. The Authority identified several data gaps that would have required further contributions from the applicant. By letter of 27 September 2013 Koppert BV withdrew its application for the approval of potassium iodide.
(5) In accordance with Article 8(1)(b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, Member States were given the possibility to grant provisional authorisations for plant protection products containing potassium iodide for an initial period of 3 years. Commission Decision 2010/457/EU (6) allowed Member States to extend provisional authorisations for potassium iodide for a period ending on 31 August 2012 at the latest. Commission Implementing Decision 2012/363/EU (7) allowed Member States to extend provisional authorisations for potassium iodide for a period ending on 31 July 2014 at the latest.
(6) Due to the withdrawal of the application, potassium iodide should therefore not be approved pursuant to Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(7) Existing provisional authorisations should, consequently, be withdrawn and no new authorisations be granted.
(8) Member States should be provided with time to withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing potassium iodide.
(9) For plant protection products containing potassium iodide, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.
(10) This Regulation does not prejudice the submission of a further application for potassium iodide pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 20(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The quality and comparability of the methods used for the monitoring of type parameters generated under Member States responsibility to perform water ecological monitoring pursuant to Article 8 of Directive 2000/60/EC should be ensured.
(2) Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC requires that methods used for the monitoring of type parameters conform to the international standards listed therein or such other national or international standards which will ensure the provision of data of an equivalent scientific quality and comparability. The international standards listed in Annex V were those available at the time of adoption of that Directive.
(3) Since the publication of Directive 2000/60/EC, a number of new standards have been published by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN), some of them jointly with the International Standards Organisation, addressing biological sampling of phytoplankton, macrophytes and phytobenthos, benthic invertebrates, fish and hydromorphological characteristics. Those standards should be added to Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC.
(4) As a result of the continued process of development of new standards and update of existing ones, some of the standards listed in Section 1.3.6 of Annex V to Directive 2000/60/EC are no longer published by CEN Member Bodies and should therefore be removed.

Having regard to the Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part, signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000 (1) and amended in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on 22 June 2010 (2), hereinafter referred to as ""the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement"", and in particular Article 96 thereof,
Having regard to the Internal Agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting within the Council, on measures to be taken and procedures to be followed for the implementation of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement (3), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
In agreement with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy,
Whereas:
(1) Decision 2010/371/EU of 7 June 2010 concerning the conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Madagascar under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement (4) was adopted in order to implement appropriate measures in response to the violation of the essential elements referred to in Article 9 of the said ACP-EU Partnership Agreement.
(2) These appropriate measures were extended until 6 December 2011 by Decision 2011/324/EU (5) since, after twelve months, no road map for a consensus-based transition had been signed by the Malagasy parties or endorsed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union or the international community.
(3) Thanks to major efforts by all Malagasy political parties and the mediation of the SADC, a ""roadmap"" to end the crisis in Madagascar was signed by a clear majority of Madagascar's political stakeholders on 16 September 2011. This roadmap outlines the commitments entered into by the signatories with a view to a neutral, inclusive and consensus-based transition process leading to the holding of transparent, free and credible elections and the return to constitutional order. Implementation has already begun with the appointment of a consensus Prime Minister on 28 October 2011.
(4) Accordingly, the appropriate measures should be amended so that the European Union can support the transition process, on condition that the Malagasy side fulfils its commitments in terms of the key transition milestones of the roadmap or of those that may emerge by agreement in the course of any political dialogue between the Malagasy government and the Union.
(5) The period of application of Decision 2010/371/EU expires on 6 December 2011. The appropriate measures as amended by this Decision should be applicable for twelve months, subject to their regular review over this period,","{'header': '7.12.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 324/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 5 December 2011\namending and extending the application period of Decision 2010/371/EU concerning the conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Madagascar under Article 96 of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement\n(2011/808/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Decision 2010/371/EU of 7 June 2010 concerning the conclusion of consultations with the Republic of Madagascar under Article 96 of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement(4)was adopted in order to implement appropriate measures in response to the violation of the essential elements referred to in Article 9 of the said ACP-EU Partnership Agreement.\n\n((2)) These appropriate measures were extended until 6 December 2011 by Decision 2011/324/EU(5)since, after twelve months, no road map for a consensus-based transition had been signed by the Malagasy parties or endorsed by the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union or the international community.\n\n((3)) Thanks to major efforts by all Malagasy political parties and the mediation of the SADC, a ""roadmap"" to end the crisis in Madagascar was signed by a clear majority of Madagascar\'s political stakeholders on 16 September 2011.

As essential elements of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, respect for human rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law form the basis of our relations.\nBy letter of 16 June 2011, the European Union informed you of its Decision 2011/324/EU to extend until 6 December 2011 the appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement.\nSince that date the European Union has closely monitored developments in your country and actively supported the mediation efforts brokered by the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and supported in particular by the Indian Ocean Commission and other African partners, which finally led to the signing on 16 September 2011 of the ""roadmap"" to end the crisis in Madagascar, as amended and explicitly extended to cover the return to Madagascar of all Malagasy citizens in exile for political reasons following the SADC summit on 11 and 12 June 2011.\nThe European Union welcomes the signing of the roadmap, which opens the way to a transition process leading to the holding of transparent, free and credible elections and a rapid return to constitutional order. The European Union would point out that it remains ready to back the transition process and support it politically and financially, should it be called on to do so by the SADC and the African Union (AU), and in close cooperation with the international community.The European Union is ready to intensify the political dialogue with the transition authorities emerging from the implementation of the roadmap in order to examine the conditions and detailed arrangements for support.\nIn accordance with Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the roadmap, the appointment of the consensus prime minister and the transitional government are crucial steps in the implementation of the process since they are responsible for creating the necessary conditions for the holding of credible, fair and transparent elections, in cooperation with the international community.\nPolitical and financial support from the European Union is subject to the Malagasy party\'s fulfilling the commitments set out below:\nCommitments of the Malagasy party\nCommitments of the European Union\nSigning\nof the roadmap\nStatement\nby the spokesperson of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas(1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 12(6) and Article 14 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 12(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, compensatory aid to Community producers for any loss of income is calculated on the basis of the difference between the flat-rate reference income and the average production income from bananas produced and marketed in the Community during the year in question.
(2) Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93 of 9 July 1993 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 as regards the aid scheme to compensate for loss of income from marketing in the banana sector(2) fixes the flat-rate reference income at EUR 64,03 per 100 kilograms net weight of green bananas ex-packing shed.
(3) In 2003, the average production income, calculated on the basis of the average of the prices for bananas marketed outside the producer regions at the stage of delivery at first port of unloading (goods not unloaded), on the one hand, and the selling prices on local markets for bananas marketed in their producer region, on the other, less the flat-rate amounts laid down in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, was less than the flat-rate reference income fixed for 2003. The compensatory aid to be granted in respect of 2003 should be fixed accordingly.
(4) Under the second subparagraph of Article 12(6) of Regulation (EEC) No 404/93, supplementary aid is granted in one or more producer regions where the average income from production is significantly lower than the average for the Community.
(5) The annual average production income from the marketing of bananas produced in Martinique and Guadeloupe has proved to be significantly lower than the Community average during 2003. As a result, supplementary aid should be granted in the producer regions of Martinique and Guadeloupe, in accordance with the practice followed in recent years. Supplementary aid covering a percentage of the difference between the average income in the Community and the average income recorded on selling products in those regions should be fixed, using a degressive calculation method in which the first 10 % of this difference is not compensated for.
(6) The unit amount of the advances and the amount of the relevant security are established, in accordance with Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1858/93, on the basis of the aid fixed for the preceding year.
(7) Given that not all the necessary data were available, it has not hitherto been possible to determine the compensatory aid for 2003. Provision should be made for the balance of the aid for 2003 and of the advances for bananas marketed during January and February 2004 to be paid within two months of the entry into force of this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that private storage aid may be granted for certain long-keeping cheeses where there is a serious imbalance of the market which may be eliminated or reduced by seasonal storage.
(2) The seasonal nature of Emmental and Gruyère cheese production is aggravated by the fact that the seasonal trend in consumption of such cheeses is the opposite of their production. Therefore, provision should be made for recourse to such storage in respect of a quantity corresponding to the difference between summer and winter production.
(3) The detailed rules of this measure should determine the maximum quantity to benefit from it as well as the duration of the contracts in relation to the real requirements of the market and the keeping qualities of the cheeses in question. It is necessary to specify the terms of the storage contract so as to enable the identification of the cheese and to maintain checks on the stock in respect of which aid is granted. The aid should be fixed taking into account storage costs and the foreseeable trend of market prices.
(4) In view of experience in controls, the provisions relating thereto should be specified, in particular as regards the documents to be presented and the on-the-spot checks to be conducted. These requirements on the subject make it necessary to stipulate that the Member States may provide that the costs of controls be fully or in part charged to the contractor.
(5) Article 1(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1756/93 of 30 June 1993 fixing the operative events for the agricultural conversion rate applicable to milk and milk products(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 569/1999(3), fixes the conversion rate to be applied in the framework of private storage aid schemes in the milk products sector.
(6) It is appropriate to guarantee the continuation of the storage operations in question.

(1) Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce or extend special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure of charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.
(2) By Decisions 95/252/EC (2) and 98/198/EC (3), the Council authorised the United Kingdom to apply a measure derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC.
(3) By letter registered with the Commission's Secretariat-General on 14 June 2004, and subsequently circulated to all Member States on 7 July 2004, the United Kingdom Government has requested an extension of the abovementioned derogation.
(4) The extant derogation allows the United Kingdom to restrict to 50 % the right of the hirer or lessee to deduct input tax on charges for the hire or lease of a business passenger car where the car is also used for private purposes. It also allows the United Kingdom not to treat as supplies of services for consideration the private use of a car hired or leased by a taxable person for business purposes. The derogation removes the need for the hirer/lessee to keep records of private mileage travelled in business cars and to account for tax on the actual private mileage of each car. It is therefore a simplification measure but also limits the scope for abuse through incorrect record keeping.
(5) The legal and factual circumstances which justified granting authorisation to apply the original derogation have not changed and are therefore still relevant.
(6) In the light of Commission proposals to amend Directive 77/388/EEC with regard to restrictions on the right to deduct VAT, it is appropriate to extend the period of the authorisation until such relevant amendments come into force. However, this authorisation will expire on 31 December 2007 at the latest if no such amendments have entered into force by that date, enabling an assessment to be made at that time of the necessity for a derogation in the light of further discussions of the proposals held in the Council.
(7) An extension will have no impact on the European Communities' own resources accruing from value added tax,","{'header': '16.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 369/61', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 December 2004\namending Article 3 of Decision 98/198/EC authorising the United Kingdom to extend application of a measure derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of the Sixth Council Directive (77/388/EEC) on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes\n(2004/855/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce or extend special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure of charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance.\n\n((2)) By Decisions 95/252/EC(2)and 98/198/EC(3), the Council authorised the United Kingdom to apply a measure derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC.\n\n((3)) By letter registered with the Commission's Secretariat-General on 14 June 2004, and subsequently circulated to all Member States on 7 July 2004, the United Kingdom Government has requested an extension of the abovementioned derogation.\n\n((4)) The extant derogation allows the United Kingdom to restrict to 50\xa0% the right of the hirer or lessee to deduct input tax on charges for the hire or lease of a business passenger car where the car is also used for private purposes.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 76/895/EEC of 23 November 1976 relating to the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (3), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (4), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Commission was informed that for azinphos-methyl current MRLs may need to be revised in the light of the availability of new information on the toxicology and consumer intake. The Commission has asked the Member State which acted as rapporteur for azinphos-methyl under Council Directive 91/414/EEC (5), to make a proposal for the review of Community MRLs. Such a proposal was submitted to the Commission.
(2) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number of Codex MRLs for azinphos-methyl. The Community MRLs based on Codex MRLs have also been evaluated by the Rapporteur Member State in the light of the new information on the risks for the consumers.
(3) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to the azinphos-methyl via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (6). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.
(4) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(5) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in the Annexes to Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community’s trading partners have been informed about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels will be taken into account.
(7) Directives 76/895/EEC, 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.

(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant exports, the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds, within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons, table grapes and apples of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports, it is appropriate to fix the A1 and B export refunds.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to Commission Decision No 3632/93/ECSC of 28 December 1993 establishing Community rules for State aid to the coal industry (1), and in particular Articles 2 (1) and 9 thereof,
Whereas:
I
By letter of 5 August 1994 Portugal submitted to the Commission, in accordance with Article 8 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, an activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry.
By the same letter Portugal informed the Commission, in accordance with Article 9 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, of the financial measures it intended to take to support the coal industry in 1994.
Pursuant to Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission is to:
- deliver an opinion as to whether the activity-reduction plan is in conformity with the general and specific objectives of the Decision,
- give its decision on the following financial measures:
- aid to the Carbonífera do Douro company totalling Esc 358 651 000 for 1994 to cover operating losses,
- aid to the Carbonífera do Douro company of up to Esc 700 000 000 for 1994, to cover exceptional social-welfare expenditure to compensate workers who lose their jobs as a result of measures taken to restructure the Portuguese coal industry.
The support measures for the coal industry proposed by Portugal meet the requirements of Article 1 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. The Commission must therefore give a decision on those measures pursuant to Article 9 (4) of the Decision as regards  their conformity with the aims and criteria set out in the Decision and their compatibility with the proper functioning of the common market.
II
The activity-reduction plan notified by Portugal must be examined in the light of the general objectives set out in Article 2 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and the specific criteria and objectives set out in Article 4 thereof.
Coal production in Portugal is concentrated almost exclusively in the hands of the Carbonífera do Douro company, which is responsible for operations in the Pejao and San Pedro da Cova coalfields. Since the late 1980s, the company has suffered operating  losses which have been covered by State aid. The losses are due mainly to geological conditions, gradual exhaustion of resources, difficulties in disposing of the output and poor quality coal. All these factors combined affect the economic viability of  the operation. Furthermore, the main - and almost only - client, Electricidade de Portugal, will be converting the Tapada do Outeiro thermal power station to natural gas, so there will no longer be an outlet for the coal produced.
On 4 October 1994, the Portuguese Council of Ministers examined Carbonífera do Douro's business strategy. The aim is gradually to reduce the output and workforce of the Germunde mine between 1990 and 1994, when final closure is planned. At the same time  the Council of Ministers approved an action plan to create new activities which would help to improve the employment situation in the Castelo de Paiva region and thereby offset the job losses resulting from the closure of the mine.
The activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry notified by Portugal in its letter of 5 August 1994 confirms the strategy of Carbonífera do Douro, forwarded to the Commission of 16 April 1991 further to its request, pursuant to Decision  91/2/ECSC (2).
This activity-reduction plan provides for final closure of the Germunde mine in 1995. This is a year later than the date given in the business strategy plan, owing to a corresponding delay in the conversion of the thermal power station to natural gas.
As the Carbonífera do Douro company is not in a position to improve its economic viability by reducing production costs, as stipulated in Article 3 (2) of the Decision, it must reduce its activities. Pursuant to Article 4 of the Decision, if the aid  covering the company's production costs is to be considered compatible with the common market, it must, as well as satisfying the conditions laid down in Article 3 (1) of the Decision, be granted within the framework of a closure plan with a deadline  occurring before the expiry of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
Given that those conditions have been fulfilled, the activity-reduction plan notified by Portugal is compatible with the general objectives and the specific criteria and objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
III
For 1994 the Carbonífera do Douro company has provided for an operating loss of Esc 358 651 000 for that part of its activities involved in the production of 140 000 tonnes of coal.
The aid intended to cover operating losses must be viewed in the light of the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, and in particular those of Article 2 (1) thereof, as part of the activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry, as notified  to the Commission.
The aid is intended to help solve the social and regional problems created by the reduction in the activity of the production units, in accordance with the second indent of Article 2 (1) of the said Decision.
In 1994 production dropped by 15 % and the workforce was reduced by 16 % by comparison with 1993. This trend corresponds to the reduction of activity provided for in the closure plan.
The proposed aid will cover the difference between projected average costs and projected average revenue. It will not exceed expected operating losses and therefore complies with the conditions laid down in the first indent of Article 3 (1) of the  Decision. The Commission has checked compliance with the other conditions laid down in Article 3 (1).
The matching of the level of aid to falling coal output, its transient nature and the implementation of a clearly-defined closure plan are in line with the conditions of implementation laid down in Article 4 of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC. Aid to cover  operating losses will facilitate the execution of the activity-reduction plan for the Portuguese coal industry.
In view of the foregoing and of the information supplied by the Portuguese authorities, the aid to be granted in 1994 to the current production of the Portuguese coal industry is compatible with the objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the  proper functioning of the common market.
IV
Aid to cover exceptional social costs, totalling Esc 700 000 000, is intended to provide partial cover for the compensation to be paid to some 450 employees of the Carbonífera do Douro company who will lose their jobs before 31 December 1994 as a result  of implementation of the plan to close the company's mining operations in 1995.
This aid is not connected to current production and must be regarded as covering inherited liabilities. In accordance with Article 5 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, such aid, which is explicitly defined in the Annex to the Decision, namely the cost of  paying social welfare benefits resulting from the pensioning-off of workers before they reach statutory retirement age, other exceptional expenditure on workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalization, and the payment of  pensions and allowances outside the statutory system to workers who lose their jobs as a result of restructuring and rationalization and to workers entitled to such payments before the restructuring, may be considered compatible with the common market  provided that the amount paid does not exceed costs.
V
In view of the foregoing, the aid to be granted by Portugal to the coal industry in 1994 is compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
Pursuant to the second indent of Article 3 (1) and to Article 9 (2) and (3) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC, the Commission must ensure that the aid authorized for current production is used exclusively for the purposes set out in Article 4 of the Decision.  It must therefore be informed of the amounts of the payments and the manner in which they are apportioned,","{'title': '94/994/ECSC: Commission Decision of 3 November 1994 authorizing the granting of aid by Portugal to the coal industry in 1994 (Only the Portuguese text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nPortugal is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling Esc 1 058 651 000 to its coal industry for the 1994 calendar year.\n\nThis amount shall be broken down as follows:\n\n- aid to the Carbonífera do Douro company amounting to Esc 358 651 000 to cover operating losses,\n\n- aid of up to Esc 700 000 000 to provide funds to compensate workers who lose their jobs as a result of the progressive closure of the mining operations of the Carbonífera do Douro company.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nPortugal shall inform the Commission, by 30 June 1995 at the latest, of the actual amount of aid paid in respect of 1994.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Portuguese Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 3 November 1994\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMarcelino OREJA\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 329, 30. 12. 1993, p. 12.(2) OJ No L 5, 8. 1. 1991, p. 25.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals (1), and in particular Article 59(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2006/88/EC lays down health requirements to be applied for the placing on the market, the importation and the transit of aquaculture animals and products thereof, and minimum preventive measures aimed at increasing the awareness and preparedness of the competent authorities, aquaculture production business operators and others related to this industry, for diseases in aquaculture animals.
(2) In order to improve the prevention of the occurrence and spread of the diseases listed in Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments, especially on species kept and their health status, should be made electronically available by the Member States.
(3) The data are currently publicly available in the registers kept by Member States pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2006/88/EC.
(4) In order to facilitate the interoperability of information systems and the use of procedures by electronic means between Member States, and to ensure transparency and comprehensibility, it is important that the information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments is presented in a uniform way throughout the Community. An Internet-based information page is technically the most feasible solution, as it ensures easy access to such information and does not involve too many resources. A model for the layout of the Internet-based information page should therefore be drawn up.
(5) Annex II to Directive 2006/88/EC establishes the information required in the register of aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments. As the aim of the Internet-based information page is to facilitate the interoperability of the relevant information recorded in the registers of aquaculture production businesses established by Member States, the website does not necessarily have to include all that information. It should however include all the information which is relevant to detect any trade restrictions caused by different health status.
(6) Directive 2006/88/EC provides that, by way of derogation from the authorisation requirement laid down in that Directive, Member States may require only the registration by the competent authority of installations other than aquaculture production businesses where aquatic animals are kept without the intention of being placed on the market, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses supplying local consumers.
(7) The risk of the spread aquatic animal diseases posed by installations, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses which, by way of derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 2006/88/EC, are registered by the competent authority, varies depending on the their nature, characteristics, and location. Member States should therefore decide to what extent information on those installations, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses should be included in the Internet-based information page.
(8) As a sufficient period of time should be provided to allow Member States to complete the Internet-based information page with the relevant information on the aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments, it should be provided for that that information is only to be available by 31 July 2009 at the latest.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '28.5.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 138/12', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 April 2008\nimplementing Council Directive 2006/88/EC as regards an Internet-based information page to make information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments available by electronic means\n(notified under document number C(2008) 1656)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2008/392/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2006/88/EC lays down health requirements to be applied for the placing on the market, the importation and the transit of aquaculture animals and products thereof, and minimum preventive measures aimed at increasing the awareness and preparedness of the competent authorities, aquaculture production business operators and others related to this industry, for diseases in aquaculture animals.\n\n((2)) In order to improve the prevention of the occurrence and spread of the diseases listed in Annex IV to Directive 2006/88/EC, information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments, especially on species kept and their health status, should be made electronically available by the Member States.\n\n((3)) The data are currently publicly available in the registers kept by Member States pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2006/88/EC.\n\n((4)) In order to facilitate the interoperability of information systems and the use of procedures by electronic means between Member States, and to ensure transparency and comprehensibility, it is important that the information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments is presented in a uniform way throughout the Community.

Member States should therefore decide to what extent information on those installations, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses should be included in the Internet-based information page.\n\n((8)) As a sufficient period of time should be provided to allow Member States to complete the Internet-based information page with the relevant information on the aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments, it should be provided for that that information is only to be available by 31 July 2009 at the latest.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter and scope', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter and scope\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision lays down rules on an Internet-based information page to be established by the Member States to make information on aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments available by electronic means in accordance with Article 59 of Directive 2006/88/EC.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Decision shall apply\nmutatis mutandis\nto installations, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses which, by way of derogation from Article 4(1) of Directive 2006/88/EC, are registered by the competent authority in accordance with Article 4(4) of that Directive subject to the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) of this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Internet-based information page', 'text': 'Article 2\nInternet-based information page\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Member States shall establish an Internet-based information page (the Internet-based information page) to make available information on farms or mollusc farming areas of aquaculture production businesses and authorised processing establishments which are authorised in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2006/88/EC.\nMember States shall decide on a case-by-case basis which installations, put and take fisheries and aquaculture production businesses referred to in Article 1(2) must be listed on the Internet-based information page, taking into account the risk of the spread of aquatic animal diseases resulting from the operations of such installations, fisheries and businesses, based on their nature, characteristics and location.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Internet-based information page shall be drawn up by the Member States in conformity with the models laid down in the following Annexes:\n(a)\nAnnex I for aquaculture production businesses keeping fish;\n(b)\nAnnex II for aquaculture production businesses keeping molluscs;\n(c)\nAnnex III for aquaculture production businesses keeping crustaceans;\n(d)\nAnnex IV for authorised processing establishments slaughtering aquaculture animals for disease control purposes, referred to in Article 4(2) of Directive 2006/88/EC.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall keep the Internet-based information page updated so that it corresponds with the information included in the register kept pursuant to Article 6 of Directive 2006/88/EC.\nChanges in health status shall be introduced in the Internet-based information page as soon as the health status recorded has changed.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall communicate the Internet address of the Internet-based information page to the Commission.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Date of application', 'text': 'Article 3\nDate of application\nThis Decision shall apply from 1 August 2008.\nHowever, the Internet-based information page shall be completed with the information referred to in Article 2(2) and in Annexes I to IV by 31 July 2009 at the latest.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'subtitle': 'Addressees', 'text': 'Article 4\nAddressees\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

Whereas Article 4 of Directive 76/895/EEC provides that where a Member State considers that a maximum level fixed in Annex II might endanger the health of humans or of animals other than harmful organisms, that Member State may temporarily reduce that level in its own territory;
Whereas the Kingdom of the Netherlands has invoked the provisions of the aforesaid Article in respect of the maximum levels fixed for dimethoate, omethoate and fenchlorphos;
Whereas fenchlorphos was the subject of the amendments provided for in Directive 80/428/EEC ; whereas the Commission has now completed its further studies on the other two pesticides;
Whereas, on the basis of new scientific data, the maximum level laid down for omethoate in Annex II must be amended;
Whereas it is also desirable to separate completely the maximum levels fixed for dimethoate and omethoate and to make a consequential adjustment to the maximum level laid down for dimethoate;

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 9 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (2), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 provide for significant changes to the rules and procedures to be complied with by food business operators and the competent authorities of the Member States. Those Regulations apply from 1 January 2006. However, the application of a number of those rules and procedures with immediate effect from that date would have presented practical difficulties in certain cases.
(2) Accordingly, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down transitional measures for the implementation of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004, (EC) No 854/2004 and (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) lays down transitional measures for a transitional period ending on 31 December 2013, in order to permit a smooth transition to the full implementation of the rules and procedures laid down in those three Regulations. The duration of the transitional period was fixed taking into account the review of this regulatory framework on hygiene provided for in those Regulations.
(3) The Report of 28 July 2009 from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the experience gained from the application of the hygiene Regulations (EC) No 852/2004, (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 (4)‘aims at presenting factually the experience gained, including the difficulties encountered, in 2006, 2007 and 2008 from the implementation of the hygiene package by all interested actors’ (‘the report’).
(4) The report includes experiences on the transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009. The report indicates that difficulties are noted in relation to the local supply of small quantities of certain food, that further clarification of situations is necessary where national import rules apply in the absence of harmonised Union rules and that crises due to imported composite products have confirmed the need for greater control of such products.
(5) Those difficulties need to be addressed by a review of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004. An impact assessment, accompanying such a review was launched immediately after the publication of the report. However, more time is needed to finalise the impact assessment before launching the ordinary procedure for the review.
(6) In addition, based on the information received from the Food and Veterinary Office, the competent authorities in the Member States and the relevant food business sectors in the Union, certain transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 should be maintained pending the completion of that review.
(7) Provision should therefore be made for a further transitional period during which certain transitional measures currently laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 should continue to apply.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 excludes from its scope of application the direct supply, by the producer, of small quantities of meat from poultry and lagomorphs slaughtered on the farm to the final consumer or to local retail establishments supplying directly the final consumer as fresh meat. However, limiting that provision to fresh meat before the end of the review exercise of that Regulation would be an additional burden for small producers. Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 provides for a derogation from the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 for the direct supply of such commodities under certain conditions, without limiting it to fresh meat. That exclusion should be maintained during the additional transitional period provided for in this Regulation.
(9) Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 lay down certain rules for imports into the Union of products of animal origin and food containing both products of plant origin and processed products of animal origin (composite products). Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 provides for transitional measures derogating from certain of those rules for certain composite products for which the public health import conditions for imports into the Union have not yet been harmonised at Union level. Those conditions were amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 28/2012 of 11 January 2012 laying down requirements for the certification for imports into and transit through the Union of certain composite products and amending Decision 2007/275/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 (5) and will not be completely harmonised before 31 December 2013. Accordingly, pending future harmonisation of Union legislation, it is necessary to provide for derogations during the additional transitional period laid down in this Regulation.
(10) In the interests of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1162/2009 should be repealed.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council have opposed them,","{'header': '1.11.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 292/10', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1079/2013\nof 31 October 2013\nlaying down transitional measures for the application of Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulations (EC) No 853/2004 and (EC) No 854/2004 provide for significant changes to the rules and procedures to be complied with by food business operators and the competent authorities of the Member States.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 164(2), and Article 170, in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 162(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the difference between prices on the world market for the products listed in Part XV of Annex I to that Regulation and prices for those products on the Union market may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Given the present situation on the market in beef and veal, export refunds should therefore be set in accordance with the rules and criteria provided for in Articles 162, 163, 164, 167, 168 and 169 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(3) Article 164(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 provides that the refund may vary according to destination, especially where the world market situation, the specific requirements of certain markets, or obligations resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty make this necessary.
(4) Refunds should be granted only on products that are allowed to move freely in the Union and that bear the health mark as provided for in Article 5(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (2). Those products must also satisfy the requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (3) and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption (4).
(5) The currently applicable refunds have been fixed by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 534/2012 (5). Since new refunds should be fixed, that Regulation should therefore be repealed.
(6) In order to prevent divergence with the current market situation, to prevent market speculation and to ensure efficient management, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Articles 26, 31 and 42 thereof, and to the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations on the common organisation of markets in agricultural products,
Whereas:
(1) Article 10(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(2) of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products provides that export licenses are to be issued on the fifth working day following that on which applications are submitted, provided that no special measures are taken by the Commission in the meantime. Similar provisions are laid down in the corresponding Regulations applicable to beef and veal, pigmeat, poultrymeat, eggs, fruit and vegetables, products processed from fruit and vegetables, wine, cereals, rice, sugar, olive oil and agricultural products exported as goods not falling within Annex I of the Treaty.
(2) The year 2000 problem and in particular transition from 1999 to the year 2000 may provoke disturbance in the transmission of data from the Member States to the Commission in ways and on a scale that cannot be foreseen or dealt with in advance despite the efforts of the authorities involved. Smooth transmission of data relating to licences applied for and the quantities concerned is vital to the sound management of the agricultural markets and in particular for the adoption by the Commission of measures relating to the issuing of export licenses with advance fixing of the refund.
(3) In the event of disturbance in data transmission, the periods for reflection in force for the issuing of export licences with advance fixing of the refund during which the Commission must take its decisions could prove too short and accordingly mean that the Commission would no longer be able to administer the licence arrangements properly. Those periods should therefore be extended in the case of licence applications submitted during the critical period in the transition to the year 2000, running from 27 December 1999 to 10 January 2000 inclusive.
(4) Should the Commission note that the abovementioned disturbance in data transmission does not arises or ocases, it should be able to re-establish the status quo as regards the periods for reflection in force before the entry into force of this Regulation as quickly as possible. Furthermore, should the Commission re-establsih the status quo in the period between 27 December 1999 and 10 January 2000 only to discover a disturbance shortly thereafter, or should a disturbance occur after 10 January 2000, it must be able to reintroduce the extended periods for reflection referred to above. The Commission should therefore be authorised to take measures on its own to repeal or re-enact all or part of this Regulation.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all the Management Committees concerned,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2558/1999 of 2 December 1999 derogating temporarily from certain provisions on the issuing of export licences with advance fixing of the refund of the refund for agricultural products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation derogates temporarily from the periods for reflection for the issuing of export licences with advance fixing of the refund referred to in the following provisions:\n\n- Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999,\n\n- Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95(3),\n\n- Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1370/95(4),\n\n- Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1371/95(5),\n\n- Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1372/95(6),\n\n- Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2190/96(7),\n\n- Article 4(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1429/95(8),\n\n- Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1685/95(9),\n\n- Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(10),\n\n- Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2543/95(11),\n\n- the second indent of Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1464/95(12).\n\n- Article 3(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1223/94(13).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions referred to in Article 1, export licences with advance fixing of the refund applications for which are submitted from 27 December 1999 to 10 January 2000 shall be issued on the 10th working day following the day of submission, provided that no special measures are taken by the Commission in the meantime.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe Commission shall take measures to repeal this Regulation and to re-establish the status quo in force before its application as soon as it notes that no disturbance has arisen in data transmission connected with the transition from 1999 to the year 2000 or that there is no further disturbance.

Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 states that the quantity of cereals on which the refund shall be granted shall be that placed under control wighted by a coefficient, fixed annually for each Member State concerned, expressing the ratio for the sprituous beverage in question between the total quantity exported and the total quantity marketed;
Whereas the second indent of Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 provides for adjustment of the coefficient where foreseeable trends for exports of spirituous beverages show a tendency to change significantly in one of the Member States concerned; whereas such an assessment may be made by taking account of a reference period of sufficient length to eliminate insignificant short-term fluctuations; whereas a period of six years prior to the year in question seems to comply with this criterion; whereas, moreover, an annual difference of less than 1 % between the respective trends in exports and the total quantities sold cannot show a tendency towards a significant change;
Whereas, owing to the fact that the Commission did not have the necessary information at its disposal within the time limit laid down in Article 16 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1842/81 of 3 July 1981 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1188/81 relating to general rules for granting refunds adjusted in the case of cereals exported in the form of certain spirituous beverages (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2187/86 (5), the coefficient could not be fixed by the date laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 1842/81 whereas the new coefficients should be fixed with effect from the start of the marketing year for cereals, that is 1 July 1986;

(2) The detailed rules on financial planning and participation in financing the restructuring and conversion scheme laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1227/2000 stipulate that the references to a given financial year refer to the payments actually made by the Member States between 16 October and the following 15 October.
(3) In accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Commission makes initial allocations to Member States per year on the basis of objective criteria, taking into account particular situations and needs, and efforts to be undertaken in the light of the objective of the scheme.
(4) In accordance with Article 14(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the financial allocation between Member States must take due account of the proportion of the Community vineyard area in the Member State concerned.
(5) For the purposes of implementing Article 14(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the financial allocations should be made in respect of a certain number of hectares.
(6) Under Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999, the Community contribution to the costs of restructuring and conversion is higher in regions classified as Objective 1 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1105/2003(6).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/676/EEC of 12 December 1991 concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (1) and, in particular, the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III thereto,
Whereas:
(1) If the amount of manure that a Member State intends to apply per hectare each year is different from those specified in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) of that subparagraph, that amount is to be fixed so as not to prejudice the achievement of the objectives specified in Article 1 of that Directive and it has to be justified on the basis of objective criteria, such as long growing seasons and crops with high nitrogen uptake.
(2) On 22 October 2007, the Commission adopted Decision 2007/697/EC granting a derogation requested by Ireland pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (2), allowing the application of livestock manure up to a limit of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year, under certain conditions, on farms with at least 80 % grassland, in the context of the Irish action programme as implemented in the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2006 (Statutory Instrument No 378 of 2006), with expiration date on 17 July 2010.
(3) On 24 February 2011, the Commission adopted Decision 2011/127/EU (3), amending Decision 2007/697/EC and extending the derogation through 31 December 2013, in the context of the Irish action programme as implemented in the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010 (Statutory Instrument No 610 of 2010).
(4) The derogation granted by Decision 2007/697/EC as amended by Decision 2011/127/EU concerned 5 093 farms in 2012, corresponding to approximately 3,34 % of the total number of holdings with grazing animals, 11,44 % of the total number of livestock units and 5,19 % of the total net agricultural area.
(5) On 4 October 2013, Ireland submitted to the Commission a request for extension of the Derogation under the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC.
(6) Ireland, in conformity with paragraph 5 of Article 3 of Directive 91/676/EEC, applies an action programme throughout its whole territory.
(7) The ‘Report from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the implementation of Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources based on Member State reports for the period 2008-2011’ shows that in Ireland for groundwater, all monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l and 87 % of monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 25 mg/l. For surface water, all monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 50 mg/l and more than 99 % of monitoring stations have mean nitrate concentrations below 25 mg/l.
(8) The number of livestock and the utilisation of chemical fertilisers decreased over the last number of years. Cattle, pig and sheep numbers decreased respectively by 4 %, 11 % and 22 % from the period 2004-2007 to the period 2008-2011. Average nitrogen loading from livestock manure in the period 2008-2011 was 105 kg/ha, with a decline of 8 % compared to 2004-2007. Phosphorus average loading in the period 2008-2011 was 15 kg/ha, with a decline of 6 % compared to 2004-2007. Average chemical N fertiliser use decreased by 6 % in the period 2008-2011 compared to 2004-2007. Average chemical P fertiliser use decreased by 31 % in the period 2008-2011 compared to 2004-2007.
(9) In Ireland, 93 % of agricultural land is devoted to grassland. Overall, in grassland farms, 47 % of the land area is farmed extensively and has therefore a relatively low stocking rate and low fertiliser inputs, 32 % is farmed under agro-environmental programmes and only 5,2 % is farmed intensively. 7 % is used for arable agriculture. The average chemical fertiliser use on grassland is 81 kg/ha nitrogen and 7 kg/ha phosphorus.
(10) The Irish climate, characterised by an annual rainfall evenly distributed throughout the year and a relatively narrow annual temperature range promote a long grass-growing season ranging from 330 days per year in the south-west to around 250 days per year in the north-east.
(11) The Commission, after examination of the request from Ireland, having considered the Irish action programme and in the light of the experience gained from the derogation provided for in Decision 2007/697/EC as amended by Decision 2011/127/EU considers that the amount of manure proposed by Ireland, corresponding to 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year, will not prejudice the achievement of the objectives of Directive 91/676/EEC, subject to certain strict conditions being met.
(12) The supporting information presented by Ireland shows that the proposed amount of 250 kg nitrogen per hectare per year on farms with at least 80 % grassland is justified on the basis of objective criteria such as high net precipitation, long growing seasons and high yields of grass with high nitrogen uptake.
(13) The Decision 2007/697/EC as amended by Decision 2011/127/EU has an expiration date of 31 December 2013. For the purpose of ensuring that the farmers concerned may continue to benefit from the derogation, it is appropriate to adopt this Decision.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Nitrates Committee set up pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 91/676/EEC,","{'title': '2014/112/EU: Commission Implementing Decision of 27\xa0February 2014 on granting a derogation requested by Ireland pursuant to Council Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources (notified under document C(2014) 1194)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe derogation requested by Ireland in a letter of 4 October 2013, for the purpose of allowing a higher amount of livestock manure than that provided for in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Annex III to Directive 91/676/EEC and in point (a) thereof, is granted, subject to the conditions laid down in this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nDefinitions\n\nFor the purpose of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n(a) ""grassland farms"" means holdings where 80 % or more of the agricultural area available for manure application is grass;\n\n(b) ""grazing livestock"" means cattle (with the exclusion of veal calves), sheep, deer, goats and horses;\n\n(c) ""grass"" means permanent grassland or temporary grassland (temporary implying leys of less than four years);\n\n(d) ""parcel"" means an individual field or a group of fields, homogeneous regarding cropping, soil type and fertilisation practices.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nScope\n\nThis Decision applies on an individual basis to grassland farms and subject to the conditions prescribed in Articles 4, 5 and 6.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nAnnual application and commitment\n\n1.

","Commission Decision
of 6 January 2004
terminating the examination procedure concerning the Brazilian Export Financing programme ""PROEX"" as applied in the regional aircraft sector
(2004/13/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3286/94 of 22 December 1994 laying down Community procedures in the field of the common commercial policy in order to ensure the exercise of the Community's rights under international trade rules, in particular those established under the auspices of the Word Trade Organisation(1), and in particular Article 11(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 27 January 1999 the German manufacturer of regional aircraft Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH (hereafter referred to as ""Dornier""), lodged a complaint with the Commission pursuant to Articles 3 and 4 of the trade barriers Regulation. The complaint related to the Brazilian export financing programme ""Programa de Financiamentò às Exportacoes"" (PROEX), which, for exports of aircraft, operates as an interest rate equalisation system.
(2) The complainant alleged that the application of PROEX to the Brazilian aircraft industry, and in particular to the regional jet manufacturer Embraer, allowed the latter to compete unfairly with Dornier on the 30-seat jet market. In particular, that PROEX allowed purchasers of Embraer aircraft to reduce their financing costs to levels below those offered in the financial markets, which led to a significant reduction of the aircraft price. The complainant contended that PROEX constituted a prohibited export subsidy under Article 3.1(a) of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement). Dornier further claimed that Embraer's abuse of the PROEX programme caused material injury to it on the Community market as well as adverse trade effects on non EC markets and most notably the US and Switzerland.
(3) The Commission found that the complaint contained sufficient prima facie evidence of a trade barrier and announced the initiation of an examination procedure in a notice published on 17 April 1999 in the Official Journal(2). The Commission's main findings are summarised below.
(4) PROEX acts as an interest rate equalisation system by virtue of which the Brazilian Government reimburses part of the interest rate which foreign purchasers of Embraer aircraft have to pay to finance their purchase. The reimbursement amounted to 3,8 percentage points per annum over a period of 15 years. PROEX allowed airlines to acquire aircraft at financing conditions that were far more favourable than those available on the market place, resulting in a net present value benefit in the range of 15 % of the aircraft's purchase price. As a result, Embraer was in a position to systematically undercut the price of Dornier's 30-seat jet and gain the lion's share of the Community and US 30-seat jet markets. In most fleet deals the PROEX financing terms were by far the most decisive factor for airlines to opt for the Brazilian jet.
(5) Under these circumstances the Commission considered that the complainant's allegations on the existence of an obstacle to trade were well founded and that PROEX resulted in adverse trade effects and injury within the meaning of Article 2(3) and (4) of the TBR.
(6) In the course of the TBR examination, a panel established, upon Canadian request by the Dispute Settlement Body (the DSB) of the World Trade Organisation (the WTO), concluded that PROEX payments constituted prohibited export subsidies inconsistent with Article 3 of the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (the SCM Agreement). The conclusions and recommendations of the panel were upheld by the WTO Appellate Body and both reports were adopted by the DSB on 20 August 1999.
(7) On 19 November 1999, Brazil informed the DSB of changes introduced to PROEX (PROEX II) in order to implement the DSB recommendations. However, Canada considered that PROEX II continued to provide export subsidies contrary to the SCM Agreement and initiated a compliance procedure under Article 21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The compliance panel and the Appellate Body upheld Canada's position and found PROEX II also to constitute an illegal export subsidy.
(8) On 6 December 2000, Brazil adopted a further revised version of PROEX (PROEX III) and Canada initiated a further compliance panel under Article 21.5 DSU to examine its WTO compatibility. This time, the panel report (adopted by the DSB on 23 August 2001) concluded that, unlike its previous versions, PROEX III as such was not in violation of Article 3.1(a) of the SCM Agreement as it did not require Brazil to provide export credits in such terms and conditions that they would constitute subsidies. The panel conclusions referred only to PROEX III as a law on its face and independently of its application and it was clearly stated that it would not necessarily follow that future applications of PROEX III would be consistent with the SCM Agreement.
(9) After the adoption of the Panel by the DSB the European Communities stated that it would remain vigilant to ensure that Brazil would respect its WTO obligations in its application of PROEX III to individual transactions. However, during the last two years of monitoring no further allegations have been made or evidence submitted against Brazil in that respect.
(10) In the absence of any evidence concerning unfair trade practices by Brazil after the adoption of the WTO Panel report on PROEX III, the European Communities considers that no action is required and that, therefore, in accordance with Article 11(1) of the Regulation, the procedure should be terminated.
(11) The Advisory Committee has been consulted on the measures provided for in this Decision,","{'title': '2004/13/EC: Commission Decision of 6 January 2004 terminating the examination procedure concerning the Brazilian Export Financing programme ""PROEX"" as applied in the regional aircraft sector'}"

COUNCIL DECISION
of 19 January 2010
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Italy
(2010/286/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and, in particular, Article 126(6) in conjunction with Article 126(13) and Article 136 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Italy,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1) (which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 also establishes provisions for the implementation of Article 104 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(5) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, required the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considered that an excessive deficit in a Member State existed or might occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4)of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which has become Article 126(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit existed in Italy. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Italy on 11 November 2009 (3).
(6) Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Italy, this overall assessment leads to the conclusions set out in this Decision.
(7) According to data notified by the Italian authorities in October 2009, the general government deficit in Italy is planned to reach 5,3 % of GDP in 2009, thus exceeding and not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value. The planned excess over the reference value can be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it results from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast projects real GDP in Italy to contract by 4,7 % in 2009, after decreasing by 1 % in 2008. A moderate recovery is anticipated for 2010, strengthening in 2011. Furthermore, the planned excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary, since the deficit is projected to increase further in 2010 and, on a no-policy change basis, to decrease marginally in 2011. The discretionary measures taken with the successive recovery packages to respond to the crisis in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan (targeted to support low-income groups and key industrial sectors) are not expected to appreciably weigh on the government balance, as they are, according to the Italian authorities, fully financed mainly by the reallocation of existing funds. The deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(8) According to data notified by the Italian authorities in October 2009, general government gross debt has been well above the 60 % of GDP reference value since before the start of stage III of the economic and monetary union and is planned to stand at 115,1 % of GDP in 2009. The Commission services’ autumn 2009 forecast projects the debt ratio to rise further, to 117,8 % in 2011. The debt ratio cannot be considered as diminishing sufficiently and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace within the meaning of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact. The debt criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.
(9) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 126(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Italy, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '21.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/40', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 19 January 2010\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Italy\n(2010/286/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 126(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1)(which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact), provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

However, the commitments under the Agreed Minutes, notably the commitment of ensuring an effective price surveillance mechanism, have not been effectively implemented by the Korean side and therefore a satisfactory result has still not been obtained.
(2) As an exceptional and temporary measure, and in order to assist Community shipyards in those segments that have suffered adverse effects in the form of material injury and serious prejudice caused by unfair Korean competition, a temporary defensive mechanism to shipbuilding was established by Regulation (EC) No 1177/2002(2) for limited market segments and for a short and limited period only. In particular, the temporary defensive mechanism was only authorised after the Community initiated dispute settlement proceedings against the Republic of Korea and could no longer be authorised if these dispute settlement proceedings were resolved or suspended.
(3) On 8 October 2002, as set out in Decision 2002/818/EC(3) the Community initiated dispute settlement proceedings against the Republic of Korea, by requesting consultations, in accordance with the World Trade Organisation's Understanding on the rules and procedures for the settlement of disputes.
(4) The consultations which were held between the Republic of Korea and the Community, as envisaged in the WTO Agreement, did not reach any satisfactory solution. On 11 June 2003, the Community requested the WTO Dispute Settlement Body to set up a panel over the unfair Korean shipbuilding practices.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1177/2002 expires on 31 March 2004. The Republic of Korea has still not effectively implemented its commitments under the agreed minutes and the WTO disputes settlement proceedings are not expected to have been resolved by that date.

Having regard to High Authority recommendation No 1-64 of 15 January 1964 to the Governments of the Member States concerning the protective duty on iron and steel products at the external frontiers of the Community (1), as last amended by recommendation 81/772/ECSC (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas, for a number of years, the Governments of the Member States of the European Coal and Steel Community meeting within the Council have granted non-member countries covered by the generalized preferences scheme tariff advantages in respect of imports into the Community of certain ECSC iron and steel products in the form of total tariff suspensions without quantitative limits for certain types of product or total tariff suspensions within the limits of quotas either fixed or to be calculated for other types of product;
Whereas the Commission is involved in the negotiation of such concessions and in the decisions of the representatives of the Governments implementing them; whereas the decisions in question are taken with the Commission's full agreement;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1310/88 (2) lays down the detailed rules for the application of these arrangements;

Whereas:
(1) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 (2) and (EC) No 1490/2002 (3) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes diphenylamine.
(3) For diphenylamine the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 451/2000 and (EC) No 1490/2002 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Moreover, those Regulations designate the rapporteur Member States which have to submit the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1490/2002. For diphenylamine the rapporteur Member State was Ireland and all relevant information was submitted on 20 June 2007.
(4) The assessment report has been peer reviewed by the Member States and the EFSA within its Working Group evaluation and presented to the Commission on 30 September 2008 in the format of the EFSA conclusion regarding the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance diphenylamine (4). This report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 26 February 2009 in the format of the Commission review report for diphenylamine.
(5) During the evaluation of this active substance, a number of concerns have been identified. In particular, it was not possible to perform a reliable consumer exposure assessment, as data are missing on the presence and toxicity of unidentified metabolites of the substance, as well as on the possible formation of nitrosamines during storage of the active substance and during processing of treated apples. Moreover, no data was available on the potential breakdown or reaction product of diphenylamine residues in processed commodities. Consequently, it was not possible to conclude on the basis of the information available that diphenylamine met the criteria for inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the results of the peer review and on its intention or not to further support the substance. The notifier submitted its comments which have been carefully examined. However, despite the arguments put forward by the notifier, the concerns identified could not be eliminated, and assessments made on the basis of the information submitted and evaluated during the EFSA expert meetings have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing diphenylamine satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC.
(7) Diphenylamine should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) Measures should be taken to ensure that authorisations granted for plant protection products containing diphenylamine are withdrawn within a fixed period of time and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.
(9) Any period of grace granted by a Member State for the disposal, storage, placing on the market and use of existing stocks of plant protection products containing diphenylamine should be limited to 12 months in order to allow existing stocks to be used in one further growing season, which ensures that plant protection products containing diphenylamine remain available to farmers for 18 months from the adoption of this Decision.
(10) This Decision does not prejudice the submission of an application for diphenylamine according to the provisions of Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the detailed implementation rules of which have been laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 of 17 January 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I (5), in view of a possible inclusion in its Annex I.
(11) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion on the measures provided for in this Decision within the time limit laid down by its Chairman and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since, on the expiry of the period laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 19(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them, they should be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '1.12.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 314/79', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 30 November 2009\nconcerning the non-inclusion of diphenylamine in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing that substance\n(notified under document C(2009) 9262)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/859/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a Member State may, during a period of 12 years following the notification of that Directive, authorise the placing on the market of plant protection products containing active substances not listed in Annex I to that Directive that are already on the market two years after the date of notification, while those substances are gradually being examined within the framework of a programme of work.\n\n((2)) Commission Regulations (EC) No 451/2000(2)and (EC) No 1490/2002(3)lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the third stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC.

Whereas, under Article 3b (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 516/77, the minimum price to be paid to producers is to be determined for the Member States other than Greece on the basis of:
(a) the minimum price applying during the previous marketing year;
(b) the movement of basic prices in the fruit and vegetable sector;
(c) the need to ensure the normal marketing of fresh products for the various uses.
Whereas Article 3c of the said Regulation lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas, in respect of tomato concentrates, preserved whole peeled tomatoes and tomato juices the volume of imports makes the third country price unrepresentative; whereas the production aid for these products must be calculated by reference to a price based on the Community market price;

of 16 March 1990
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferroboron alloy originating in Japan
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1) and in particular Article 11 thereof.
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) The Commission received a complaint lodged by the 'ComitĂŠ de Liaison des producteurs de ferro-alliages de la CommunautĂŠ EuropĂŠenne' on behalf of producers whose collective output constitutes almost all output in the Community of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of ferroboron and commenced an investigation. The product investigated coresponds to CN code ex 7202 99 90.
(2) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainants. It asked the parties concerned to answer the questionnaires which had been sent to them and gave them an opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) Two Japanese exporters, five importers and the three EEC producers returned a questionnaire to the Commission duly completed and stated their views in writing. Three other Japanese companies had received exporters' questionnaires two of which indicated that no ferroboron had been exported by them to the Community during the investigation period while the remaining company did not respond.
(4) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary and carried out inspections at the premises of the following companies:
- EEC producers
- London and Scandinavian Metallurgical Co., Ltd, London, United Kingdom,
- Pechiney Electrometallurgie, Paris, France,
- Gesellschaft fuer Elektrometallurgie GmbH, Duesseldorf, Germany;
- Japanese producers/exporters
- Nippon Denko Co., Ltd, Tokyo,
- Yahagi Iron Co., Ltd, Nagoya.
(5) The investigation on dumping covered the period from 1 January 1988 to 30 November 1988.
(6) Due to the complexity of the proceeding, in particular the difficulties met by the Commission in obtaining, from interested parties, the relevant data to allow a provisional finding to be made, the investigation exceeded the normal period of one year.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION
I. Description of Product
(7) The product which is the subject of the investigation is ferroboron, a ferro-alloy containing variously 16 % to 20 % of boron.
Boron is added to steel because it increases its durability and hardness. Boron also finds widespread use as a means of fixing nitrogen, making the resultant steel non-ageing ageing and easier to work.
(8) The product is available in three forms: grain, powder and lumps. There are two different methods of manufacture:
- Reduction of boric acid, boric oxide, colemanite or mixtures thereof with aluminium (alumino-therm),
- Reduction of boric acid, boric oxide, colemanite or mixtures thereof with carbon (carbotherm).
II. Like product
(9) The Commission found that the ferroboron produced in the Community undergoes the same methods of manufacture as that sold in and exported from Japan and that they are like products in all essential physical and technical characteristics.
C. DUMPING
(a) Normal value
(10) Normal value was established on the basis of the comparable prices actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for the like product on the Japanese market.
(11) Domestic sales considered for calculation of normal value were made to independent customers at a profit in substantial quantities. The weighted average of the prices of these sales were therefore considered to be representative of those on the Japanese domestic market.
(b) Export prices
(12) Export prices were established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the like product sold for export to the Community.
(c) Comparison
(13) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate of differences affecting price comparability, such as commissions, credit terms, transport and insurance, handling and related costs.
The two Japanese exporters concerned claimed that, for the purposes of the comparison, due account should be taken of differences in the boron content of the product and as regards its various sizes (lumps, grain and powder). The Commission accepted, on the basis of the information supplied to it, that the different percentages of boron contained in the product affected price comparability. The comparison was therefore made between products which had the same or almost the same boron content.
Furthermore, in connection with the effect of the different sizes available on price comparability, no consistent evidence was provided by the two exporters. Consequently, the Commission did not consider it appropriate to take account of such differences, at this stage of the proceeding.
(14) All comparisons were made at the same level of trade (processors or traders).
(15) Normal values for the domestically sold product of the Japanese companies were compared with the prices of the comparable product sold for export to the Community on a transaction-by-transaction basis. This comparison showed the existence of dumping on the part of the exporters investigated, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
The margin of dumping varied according to the exporter. The weighted average margins as expressed as a percentage of total c.i.f. Community frontier values were as follows:
- Nippon Denko Co., Ltd, Tokyo: 23,3 %,
- Yahagi Iron Co., Ltd, Nagoya: 11,4 %.
(16) For the exporter who neither replied to the Commission's questionnaire, nor otherwise made himself known, dumping was determined on the basis of the facts available in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (7) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
In this connection, the Commission considered that the results of its investigation provided the most appropriate basis for determination of the margins of dumping and that it would create an opportunity for circumvention of the duty to hold that the dumping margin for this exporter was any lower than the highest margin of 23,3 %, determined with regard to an exporter who had cooperated in the investigation. For these reasons, it is considered appropriate to use this later dumping margin for this exporter.
D. INJURY
I. Volumes and market shares of dumped imports
(17) With regard to injury caused by the dumped imports, the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports of ferroboron manufactured by the two Japanese companies concerned increased from 54 tonnes in 1985 to 483 tonnes in the reference period (first 11 months of 1988). Their corresponding cumulated market share climbed from 5,3 % in 1985 to 37,9 % in the investigation period. The most affected Member States were France and Germany. Imports into France increased from virtually nil in 1985 to 87 tonnes in the reference period. Imports into Germany increased from virtually nil in 1985 to 121 tonnes in the investigation period.
This growth of the Japanese share of the market occurred during a period when the EEC consumption increased from 1 015 tonnes in 1985 to 1 276 tonnes in the investigation period with an increase of 25,7 %. However the EEC's producers' sales declined from 858 tonnes in 1985 to 793 tonnes in the investigation period with a decrease of 24,4 % in terms of market share.
II. Price undercutting
(18) The evidence available to the Commission indicates that the prices at which dumped imports from Japan were sold in the Community significantly undercut the prices of Community producers during the investigation period. The prices taken into account were, in both cases, those to the first unrelated purchaser in the Community. The weighted average price undercutting ranged from 18,2 % to 22,8 %. This has resulted in the Community producers' prices being considerably depressed.
III. Production
(19) The production of ferroboron manufactured by the Community industry increased from 1 556 tonnes in 1985 to 1 879 tonnes in the investigation period. Nevertheless, it was found that while this trend in the production was influenced by an increase in the Community exports to third Countries, the total amount of ferroboron sold in the EEC market by the Community industry fell from 858 tonnes in 1985 to 793 tonnes in the investigation period, corresponding to a decrease of 7,6 %.
IV. Other relevant factors
(20) Further evidence of the injury suffered by the Community industry was found in relation to trends in capacity utilization and profitability.
(21) Between 1985 and 1988, the Community industry increased its capacity to meet the increase in demand which occured in the Community. However, capacity utilization increased from 70,7 % to 73,2 % during this period, which was not in proportion with the increase in EEC consumption and was essentially due to the positive development of exports to third countries.
(22) As regards the profit and loss situation the Community producers concerned have registered losses on a weighted average basis of 10,9 % in the investigation period, while in 1985 they made substantial profits.
(23) As regards one of the Community producers, a Japanese exporter claimed that this company, responsible for an important percentage of the Community production of ferroboron, should not be taken into account because there was no evidence that it had suffered any injury. However, the Commission found that the dumped imports had had a considerable impact on the company in question, especially when examining its fall in market share in those Member States' markets where the Japanese imports had increased sharply. The Commission then considered it appropriate to carry out an injury assessment in conformity with Article 4 of Council Regulation No 2423/88, as regards all three Community producers in question.
E. CAUSATION OF INJURY
I. Effects of dumped imports
(24) In its examination as to whether the material injury suffered by the Community industry was caused by the effects of the dumping described above, the Commission found that the rapid deterioration of the Community producers situation coincided with an equally rapid influx of Japanese exports.
II. Effects of other factors
(25) The Commission has also considered whether injury had been caused by factors other than the dumped imports. In particular it looked at imports from other third countries and found that while these imports corresponded to 88 tonnes in 1985 they declined to virtually nil from 1986.
(26) At the request of one of the exporters, the Commission examined whether the loss registered in the market share of one of the Community producers had been caused by a commercial agreement with its parent company, according to which it would concentrate its efforts on exports to third countries instead of selling ferroboron in the Community.
No reasonable evidence was found which could permit the Commission to conclude that the producer in question had decided not to sell within the Community. On the contrary the information available and the statistics examined showed that the parent company sold in the national market concerned only via its subsidiary. Furthermore the subsidiary in question bought from the parent company and resold a very small quantity of ferroboron which could in no way replace the serious loss of total sales suffered in the same market.
(27) One of the exporters claimed that the difficult economic situation of one of the major European producers was due, on one side, to the highly competitive nature of the market within the EEC and, on the other side, to the decision to continue production of the type of ferroboron commonly referred to as 'ferroboron 14'. In this context the Commission found that production of 'ferroboron 14' had been stopped by the company in question before the reference period, during which another type of ferroboron had been manufactured. Furthermore, the information available showed that whenever, in a Member State, the market share of this company declined, this did not necessarily lead to a commensurate increase in the other Community producers' market share.
III. Conclusion
(28) The Commission therefore concluded, on the basis of the abovementioned evidence, that the dumped imports from Japan taken in isolation have caused material injury to the Community industry. F. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(29) Ferroboron production is an important industry in the Community, being closely linked to the steel industry. This production is of particular significance in the development of special steels and, most particularly METGLAS amorphous metal, a product employed in the high-technology sectors.
(30) It is very likely that, in the absence of any protection against dumping, the Community producers which are suffering from its injurious effects would be required to cease production of ferroboron with the consequence that an important industrial sector would become more and more dependent on imports.
(31) The interest of the Community processing industry of ferroboron has also been considered. However, the Commission has concluded that in evaluating the opposing interests of the producers and the transformers, the first should prevail, given the overall importance of ferroboron production. Furthermore, the incidence of a price increase in the costs of the processing industry due to the application of anti-dumping duties is likely to be small.
No consumers or processors of ferroboron made their views known to the Commission.
G. RATE OF DUTY
(32) In order to eliminate totally the injury sutained by the complainant Community industry it would be necessary for all undercutting, as described in recital 21, to be eliminated. In addition, these producers would need to be placed in the position where they could achieve further price rises in order to enable them to eliminate losses and to realize adequate returns on sales. This would permit the possibility of regaining market share and reasonable profit levels. In the circumstances of this industry, and for the purposes of provisional determination, the Commission considers that an adequate annual return on sales allowing a balanced development would be of 11 %. If these elements are combined in a calculation of the price level that would be necessary to remove the injury sustained, it can be shown that price increases for Japanese imports of between 34,3 % and 42,3 % would be required.
(33) Under these conditions, according to Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the amount of provisional duty should correspond to the dumping margins found, which are lower than the thresholds of injury established for the Japanese exports assessed in isolation.","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 665/90 of 16 March 1990 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of ferroboron alloy originating in Japan', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1287/95 (2), and in particular Articles 4 and 5 thereof,
Having regard to Council Decision 94/729/EC of 31 October 1994 on budgetary discipline (3), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas Article 4 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 stipulates that the Member States must themselves mobilize the funds to cover the expenditure of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, hereafter referred to as the 'EAGGF Guarantee Section`; whereas under the same Regulation, the Commission grants only monthly advances against booking of the expenditure effected by the Member States;
Whereas, with a view to ensuring the proper management of the appropriations entered in the budget of the Communities for the EAGGF Guarantee Section, each paying agency must keep accounts relating exclusively to expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section;
Whereas the transmission by the Member States to the Commission of all data relating to the expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section must be organized; whereas, in this respect, it is appropriate to recognize that the communication of data relating to quantities should benefit from a certain margin of imprecision which may be explained, among other things, by administrative difficulties linked to their establishment; whereas, this applies also to the estimates of expenditure which, while they must be reliable, are by their nature of an approximative character; whereas, furthermore, it is inappropriate to request the communication of data relating to recoveries where this would constitute a heavy administrative burden;
Whereas the common agricultural regulations include deadlines for payment of aids to beneficiaries by Member States; whereas all payments effected after those deadlines, and for which the delay in payment is unjustified, must be regarded as ineligible, and therefore cannot, in principle be the subject of an advance on the booking of expenditure; whereas, however, in order to modulate the financial impact in proportion to the delay incurred in payment, the reduction in the advances should be graduated as a function of the size of the delay recorded;
Whereas, where Member States fail to meet the deadlines agreed for the notification of data relating to expenditure or to ensure the consistency of such data, the Commission may, pursuant to Article 13 of Decision 94/729/EC defer accordingly the payment of the advances against booking;
Whereas Article 4 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 on general rules on the financing of EAGGF Guarantee Section intervention (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1571/93 (5), stipulates that where an intervention measure entails buying-in and storage of products, the amount financed is to be determined by the annual accounts established by the intervention agencies; whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3492/90 (6) laid down rules and conditions governing these accounts; whereas the procedures according to which the financing of such measures fits into the system of advances against booking should be made clear;
Whereas the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 stipulates that expenditure for October is related to October if made between 1 and 15 October and to November if made from 16 to 31 October; whereas it is preferable to avoid the division of the accounts provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78, in view of their complexity; whereas, accordingly, it should be stipulated that expenditure deriving from September operations is to be treated in the accounts by the paying agencies on the basis of 50 % in respect of the first 15 days of October, and the rest, including any adjustments or corrections, in respect of the last 16 days of October;
Whereas Article 5a of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 authorizes remuneration of the funds mobilized by certain Member States; whereas procedures for declaration by these Member States of interest chargeable to the Community should be laid down;
Whereas the concept of expenditure to be declared monthly by the paying agencies should be properly defined;
Whereas a uniform presentation of documents to be sent in by the Member States is needed; whereas in view of the need for frequent adaptation of such documents to changes in management requirements, the Commission must be in a position to adopt and adapt without delay, under a simplified procedure, the forms to be used;
Whereas in order to facilitate the application of the provisions in this matter it is advisable to replace Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2776/88 (7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 775/90 (8), with a new Regulation;

Whereas the Council has been able to decide on the amount of the basic levy and on the intervention price for common wheat of breadmaking quality, used to calculate the additional levy, that are to be applied in the month of June 1988 but has not been able to decide the arrangements to apply to small producers provided for at the first indent of the second subparagraph of Article 4 (1) of the abovementioned Regulation;

Whereas:
(1) During the year 2000, evidence of bluetongue outbreaks have been notified in France, Italy and Spain.
(2) Decisions have been adopted to prevent the spread of the disease by restriction of movements, from the affected regions of these three Member States, of animals of species susceptible to bluetongue and their sperm ova and embryos.
(3) With the view to maintain the necessary restriction to movements it is necessary to demarcate protection and surveillance zones corresponding to each situations of these three Member States, in accordance with Article 8(2)(d) of Directive 2000/75/EC.
(4) In Greece, the results of the epidemiological surveillance implemented in accordance with Commission Decision 2000/350/EC(2) (13000 samples) give a precise picture of the situation and drive to the conclusion that a low circulation of the virus is restricted to certain specific regions of the Greek territory.
(5) Greece has adopted since November 1999 (Ministerial Decision No 398171 as amended by Ministerial Decision No 331765) national measures prohibiting the dispatch to Member States and export to third countries of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos of species susceptible to bluetongue from its entire territory.
(6) A specific surveillance program is implemented by Greece in the frame of Commission Decision 2000/71/EC(3) with the view to detect in real time possible reinvasions from abroad.
(7) It is however necessary to demarcate a protection and a surveillance zone in Greece in the frame of Directive 2000/75/EC, taking into account the epidemiological geographical and climatical data available.
(8) It is also necessary to take into account the economical impact of restrictions to movement and therefore it is advisable to consider the whole territory of Greece as protection and surveillance zones.

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, as amended, provides for the possibility of reducing structural overcapacity in inland waterway transport in the Member States concerned by introducing schemes coordinated at Community level for the scrapping of vessels in 1996, 1997 and 1998, with a view to reducing fleet capacity by some 15 %;

Whereas, in respect of the scrapping scheme for 1998, the total financial contribution payable to the Scrapping Funds by the Member States concerned is estimated at ECU 64 million, to achieve a reduction in capacity of about 5 %; whereas this contribution is calculated in proportion to the size of the active fleet of each Member State concerned, as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2254/96 (5);
Whereas, for 1998, the financial contribution from the Member States concerned and the contribution payable by the trade must be shared between dry cargo vessels, pusher craft and tanker vessels;
Whereas, the 1997 scrapping premium rates should be maintained in 1998 since they have demonstrated their effectiveness; whereas the premium rate percentage bracket should also be extended from 80 to 120 % of the maximum values laid down with effect from 1 January 1998 in order to make the scrapping scheme more attractive for those largest vessels which cause excess capacity, and in order to enable certain skippers to leave the trade under acceptable financial conditions before complete liberation of the market on 1 January 2000;
Whereas, to enable the 1998 scrapping scheme to go ahead, between June and July 1998, the lodging of new applications pursuant to Article 6 (6) (a) must continue to be suspended so that no vessel can be placed on a quarterly waiting list and at the same time be entered under the 1998 scrapping scheme procedure; whereas the quarterly mechanism for applying for premiums from the Scrapping Funds, as provided for in Article 6 (6) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1102/89, as amended, must therefore also continue to be suspended;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 1999/201/EC of 14 December 1998 on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health in respect of trade in live animals and animal products (1), and in particular Article 4, third paragraph thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (hereafter the Agreement) provides for the possibility of recognising equivalence for sanitary measures after the exporting Party has objectively demonstrated that its measures achieve the importing Party’s appropriate level of protection. The determination of equivalence was carried out and concluded with Canada on animal health measures concerning bovine semen, and on public health measures concerning pig meat. Equivalence has been concluded on a reciprocal basis.
(2) As regards equivalence for Canadian exports of pig meat to the EU ante- and post-mortem provisions, the definition of market hogs and other hygiene requirements are to be reviewed when the new EU Food Hygiene Regulations will be applied. Similarly, as regards equivalence for EU exports of pig meat to Canada, some provisions are to be reviewed when the Canadian Meat Inspection Regulation will be amended.
(3) The Joint Management Committee for the Agreement, at its meeting on 16 and 17 February 2004, issued a recommendation concerning the determination of equivalence for bovine semen and pig meat. At the same meeting, the Committee recommended to update the references to EU and Canadian legislation in the annexes to the Agreement. The Committee, at its meeting on 16 and 17 July 2003, based on recent amendments of the Canadian legislation, issued a recommendation to delete paragraph 2 of Chapter I of footnote B in Annex V to the Agreement as regards automatic temperature recorders in frozen fish storage areas and non-hand operated wash-basins in processing areas. At the same meeting, the Committee, based on the Community experience with imports of certain Canadian fish and fishery products from Canada and animal welfare considerations, issued a recommendation for reducing the frequency of the EC identity and physical import checks for such consignments.
(4) As a result of these recommendations it is appropriate to modify the relevant parts in Annex V and Annex VIII to the Agreement.
(5) Pursuant to Article 16(3) of the Agreement, amendments to the Annexes shall be agreed upon by an Exchange of Notes between the Parties.
(6) Those modifications should be approved on behalf of the Community.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '16.4.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 98/32', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 16 February 2005\napproving on behalf of the European Community amendments to the Annexes to the Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures applicable to trade in live animals and animal products\n(notified under document number C(2005) 336)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/306/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Agreement between the European Community and the Government of Canada on sanitary measures to protect public and animal health applicable to trade in live animals and animal products (hereafter the Agreement) provides for the possibility of recognising equivalence for sanitary measures after the exporting Party has objectively demonstrated that its measures achieve the importing Party’s appropriate level of protection.

(3) It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries in the Black Sea, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. Fishing opportunities should be allocated to Member States in such a way as to ensure relative stability of fishing activities of each Member State for each fish stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy established in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013.
(4) TACs should be established on the basis of the available scientific advice, taking into account biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in the light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders.
(5) The use of fishing opportunities set out in this Regulation is subject to Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (2) and in particular to Articles 33 and 34 thereof concerning, respectively, the recording of catches and fishing effort and the notification of data on the exhaustion of fishing opportunities. It is therefore necessary to specify the codes to be used by the Member States when sending data to the Commission relating to landings of stocks subject to this Regulation.
(6) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 847/96 (3), the stocks that are subject to the various measures referred to therein must be identified.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EEC) No 539/2001(2) includes Romania among the third countries whose nationals are exempted from visa requirements, but makes the application of the visa exemption to Romanian nationals conditional on a decision to be taken at a later stage by the Council. That decision is to be taken on the basis of a report which the Commission was to present to the Council by 30 June 2001 at the latest and which was to be accompanied by any recommendations that might be appropriate.
(2) In its report of 29 June 2001, the Commission notes the undeniable progress made by Romania as regards illegal immigration from its country, its visa policy and the controls at its borders. The Commission also sets out the commitments entered into by Romania in this field. The Commission concludes by recommending to the Council that Romanian nationals be exempted from the visa requirement as from 1 January 2002.
(3) In order to apply the visa exemption to Romanian nationals, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 which provisionally maintain the visa requirement should be deleted.

Whereas, under Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86, the minimum price to be paid to producers is to be determined on the basis of, firstly, the minimum price applying during the previous marketing year, secondly, the movement of basic prices in the fruit and vegetable sector, and, thirdly, the need to ensure the normal marketing of fresh products for the various uses;
Whereas Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 lays down the criteria for fixing the amount of production aid; whereas account must, in particular, be taken of the aid fixed for the previous marketing year adjusted to take account of changes in the minimum price to be paid to producers, the non-member country price and, if necessary, the pattern of processing cost assessed on a flat-rate basis;
Whereas Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 provides that the minimum price to be paid to producers for unprocessed dried figs is to be increased each month during a certain period of the marketing year by an amount corresponding to storage costs; whereas, in fixing this amount, the technical storage costs and interest costs should be taken into consideration;

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (2) lays down general rules for food business operators on the hygiene of foodstuffs, based on hazard analysis and critical control points principles. It provides that food business operators are to comply with the structural requirements based on those principles. Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (3) supplements the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004. The rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 include specific requirements for meat and milk processing establishments.
(2) According to the results of a Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) mission to Bulgaria carried out from 27 November 2006 to 1 December 2006 certain processing establishments in the meat and milk sectors do not comply with the provisions of Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 and (EC) No 853/2004.
(3) Furthermore, the current traceability system in Bulgaria is not sufficient to cover the needs of the situation in Bulgaria under conditions where meat coming from third countries and meat obtained in Bulgaria before 1 January 2007, and raw milk in Bulgaria, which do not comply with the requirements of those Regulations, are on the territory of Bulgaria.
(4) Taking into account the current situation in Bulgaria, it is appropriate to provide for transitional measures as regards certain products of the meat and milk sectors.
(5) During the transitional period the situation of all processing establishments in the meat and milk sectors has to be assessed in view to ensure the completion of the upgrading process of certain establishments to be in compliance with Community requirements. Furthermore the traceability system has to be improved to meet Community standards.
(6) During the transitional period, it is necessary to provide for a prohibition on the dispatch of certain products of the meat and milk sectors from Bulgaria to other Member States. However, it is appropriate to provide for a derogation for certain processing establishments authorised under Community legislation to export those products to the Community before 1 January 2007, in the light of guarantees available for those establishments.
(7) The transitional period provided for in this Decision should be limited to one year. The situation of the meat and milk sectors in Bulgaria is to be reviewed before the end of that period, in particular in view of the results of new FVO inspections to be carried out in January 2007.

Whereas, in accordance with Article 75 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually, on the one hand, on the basis of the arithmetical average of producer prices of each Member State of 'the Community of Nine', increased by the transport and packaging costs borne by the products from the areas of production up to the representative centres of Community consumption and, on the other hand, taking into account the trend of production costs in the fruit and vegetables sector; whereas the said producer prices are to correspond to an average of the price quotations recorded over three years prior to fixing the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price may not exceed the level of the reference price applied vis-Ă -vis third countries, this Community offer price being reduced by 15 % at the time of the fifth move toward price alignment referred to in Article 59 of the Act;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal price variations, the marketing year should be split into several periods and a Community offer price fixed for each such period;
Whereas, by virtue of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 10/81, the rates used to calculate production prices are those recorded for an indigenous product whose trade characteristics are defined, on the representative market or markets within the production zones where the rates are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a substantial proportion of marketable production throughout the year or during a part of the year and which correspond to quality category I and to set conditions in respect of packaging; whereas the average rate for each representative market is to be drawn up disregarding rates which may be considered excessively high or low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the said market;
Whereas application of the abovementioned criteria results in fixing the Community offer prices for table grapes for the period 21 July to 20 November 1985 at the levels set out hereinafter;

That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3815/89 (2) lays down detailed rules for the application of the compensation mechanism to imports of fruit and vegetables from compensation Spain;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 152 of the Act of Accession, a compensation mechanism is to be introduced on imports into the Community as constituted at 31 December 1985, hereinafter referred to as the 'Community of Ten', from 1 January 1990, of fruit and vegetables from Spain for which a reference price is fixed with regard to third countries; whereas, Community offer prices for cucumbers coming from Spain should be fixed only during the period where reference prices are fixed with regard to third countries, this means from 11 February up to and including 10 November;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 152 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually on the basis of the arithmetic mean of the producer prices in each Member State of the Community of Ten, plus transport and packaging costs incurred by the products from the production regions to the representative consumption centres of the Community and bearing in mind developments in the cost of production in the fruit and vegetable sector; whereas the abovementioned producer prices correspond to the average prices recorded during the three years preceding the date of fixing of the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price cannot exceed the reference price applied for third countries;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal variations in prices, the marketing year should be divided into one or more periods and a Community offer price should be fixed for each of them;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3709/89, the producer prices to be used for the determination of the Community offer price are to be those of a domestic product defined by its commercial characteristics recorded on the representative market or markets located in the production areas where prices are lowest for products or varieties representing a considerable proportion of production marketed throughout the year or during a part of the latter and which meet quality class I requirements and conditions laid down as regards packaging; whereas the average price for each representative market must be established after disregarding prices which may be considered excessively high or excessively low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the market; whereas, moreover, if the average price for a Member State shows excessive variations with respect of normal price fluctuations, it shall not be taken into account;
Whereas cucumbers produced in the Community of Ten are grown mainly under glass; whereas the Community offer prices must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas cucumbers imported from Spain during the same period will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such cucumbers may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for cucumbers not grown under glass should therefore be adjusted by a conversion factor;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned criteria results in Community offer prices being fixed for cucumbers for the period 11 February to 10 November 1990 at the levels set out hereinafter;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee provided for in that Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Definitive action
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 (2), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1027/83 (3), imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) In December 1984, after the introduction and subsequent reduction of the definitive countervailing duty, the Spanish Government and exporters requested a further reduction in the rate of the definitive countervailing duty on the ground that Government Decree No 1313/1984 of 20 June 1984, published in the Spanish official gazette (BOE No 164) of 10 July 1984, which entered into force on 11 July 1984, had modified the system of export rebates. Article 4 of the Decree provided for an across-the-board reduction of 15 % in the rate of the rebate.
C. Subsidy
(3) The Commission obtained the necessary information from the Spanish Government and the exporters, including particulars from the exporters of deliveries to the Community of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels since 11 July 1984, and of the export rebates received, which were verified to the extent considered necessary. It emerged that as from 11 July 1984 the rebate for the products in question was cut by 15 % from 14,5 to 12,3 % (rounded off to the first decimal place). The export subsidy as found by the Commission was thereby reduced by 2,2 % from 10 to 7,8 % of the export price.
D. Duty
(4) Since the Spanish Government has lowered by 2,2 % the rebate on exports on the said products, a corresponding reduction with effect from 11 July 1984 should be made in the definitive countervailing duty. Under Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (4), importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid in excess of the amount due under the abovementioned Regulation on goods released for free circulation in the Community after 10 July 1984,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 638/85 of 11 March 1985 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 (2) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 are replaced by the following:', 'text': ""Article 1 (2) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 are replaced by the following:\n\n'2.

The actual expenditure incurred shall be notified to the Commission broken down by type of  action or sub-programme in a way demonstrating the link between the indicative financial plan and  expenditure actually incurred. If France keeps suitable computerized accounts this will be  acceptable.\n\n8.  All payments of aid granted by the Community pursuant to this Decision shall be made to the  authority designated by France, which will also be responsible for repayment to the Community of  any excess amount.\n\n9.  All commitments and payments shall be made in ecus.\n\nFinancial schedules for Community support frameworks and amounts of Community aid shall be  expressed in ecus at the rate fixed by this Decision.

Inspections may be carried out by the Commission or the Court of Auditors should it so  request. France and the Commission shall immediately exchange all relevant information in regard to  the outcome of an inspection.\n\n11.  For three years following the last payment relating to the assistance the authority  responsible for implementation shall keep available to the Commission all documentary evidence of  expenditure incurred.\n\n12.  When it submits applications for payment France shall make available to the Commission all  official reports relating to supervision of the measures in question.\n\nReduction, suspension and withdrawal of aid 13.  France shall declare that Community funds are used for the intended purposes. If  implementation of a measure appears to require only part of the financial assistance allotted the  Commission shall immediately recover the amount due. In cases of dispute the Commission shall  examine the case, asking France or the other authorities designated by France for implementation of  the measure to submit their comments within two months.\n\n14.  The Commission may reduce or suspend aid for a measure if the examination confirms the  existence of an irregularity, in particular of a substantial modification affecting the nature or  conditions of implementation of the measure for which approval by the Commission has not been  sought.\n\nRecovery of undue payments 15.  All sums unduly paid must be reimbursed to the Community by the designated authority indicated  in point 8. Interest may be levied on sums not reimbursed.

Monitoring and assessment I.  Monitoring committee 1.  Establishment Independent of the financing of this action, a monitoring committee for the programme shall be set  up, composed of representatives of France and the Commission. It shall review implementation of the  programme and, where appopriate, propose any adjustments required.\n\n2.  The committee shall establish its own internal procedures within one month of the notification  of this Decision to France.\n\n3.  Competence of monitoring committee The committee:\n\n-  shall have as its general responsibility the satisfactory progress of the programme towards  attainment of the objectives set.

Care must be taken to see that the main objectives of the programme are not thereby compromised,\n\n-  shall give its opinion on the adjustments proposed to the Commission,\n\n-  shall issue an opinion on technical assistance projects scheduled in the programme,\n\n-  shall give its opinion on the final draft report,\n\n-  shall report regularly to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on the progress of the  programme and expenditure incurred, at least twice during the relevant period.\n\nII.  Monitoring and assessment of the programme during the implementation period (continuous  monitoring and assessment) 1.  The national agency responsible for implementation shall also be responsible for continuous  monitoring and assessment of the programme.\n\n2.  By continuous monitoring is meant an information system on the state of progress of the  programme. Continuous monitoring will cover the measures contained in the programme. It involves  reference to the financial and physical indicators structured so as to permit assessment of the  correspondence between expenditure on each measure and predefined physical indicators showing the  degree of realization.\n\n3.  Continuous assessment of the programme will involve analysis of the quantitative results of  implementation on the basis of operational, legal and procedural considerations. The purpose is to  guarantee correspondence between measures and programme objectives.\n\nImplementation report and scrutiny of the programme 4.  France shall notify to the Commission, within one month of adoption of the programme, the name  of the authority responsible for compilation and presentation of the final implementation report.\n\nThe final report shall contain a concise evaluation of the entire programme (degree of achievement  of physical and qualitative objectives and of progress accomplished) and an assessment of the  immediate phytosanitary and economic impact.\n\nThe final report on the present programme will be presented by the competent authority to the  Commission and to the Standing Committee on Plant Health on 31 December 1996 at the latest.\n\n5.  The Commission may jointly with France call in an independent assessor who shall, on the basis  of the continuous monitoring, carry out the continuous assessment defined at 3. He may submit  proposals for adjustment of the sub-programmes and/or measures, modification of the selection  criteria for projects, etc., in the light of difficulties encountered in the course of  implementation. On the basis of monitoring of management he shall issue an opinion on the  admimistrative measures to be taken. To guarantee the assessor's impartiality the Commission will  not pay the entire cost of employing him.\n\nC.  Information and publicity In the framework of this action, the agency appointed as responsible for the programme shall ensure  that it is adequately publicized.\n\nIt shall in particular take action to:\n\n-  make potential recipients and professional organizations aware of the possibilities offered  under the programme measures,\n\n-  make the general public aware of the Community's role in the programme.\n\nFrance and the agency responsible for implementation shall consult the Commission on initiatives  envisaged in this area, possibly through the monitoring committee. They shall regularly notify the  Commission of information and publicity measures adopted, either by a final report or through the  monitoring committee.\n\nThe national legal provisions on confidentiality of information shall be complied with.\n\nII.  COMPLIANCE WITH COMMUNITY POLICIES\n\nCommunity policies applying in this  field must be complied with.\n\nThe programme shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions on coordination of and  compliance with Community policies. The following information must be supplied by France.\n\n1.  Award of public contracts The 'public contracts` (1) questionnaire must be completed for:\n\n-  public contracts above the ceilings set by the 'supplies` and 'works` directives that are  awarded by contract-awarding authorities as defined in these directives and are not covered by the  exemptions specified therein,\n\n-  public contracts below these ceilings where they constitute components of a single piece of work  or of uniform supplies of a value above the ceiling. By 'a single piece of work` is meant a product  of building or civil engineering works intended in itself to fulfil an economic or technical  function.\n\nThe thresholds will be those in force on the date of notification of this Decision.\n\n2.  Protection of the environment (a)  General information -  description of the main environmental features and problems of the region concerned, giving a  description of the important conservation areas (sensitive zones),\n\n-  a comprehensive description of the major beneficial and harmful effects that the programme,  given the investments planned, is likely to have on the environment,\n\n-  a description of the action planned to prevent, reduce or offset any serious harmful effects on  the environment,\n\n-  a report on consultations with the responsible environmental authorities (opinion of the  Ministry for the Environment or its equivalent) and, if there were any such consultations, with the  public concerned.\n\n(b)  Description of planned activities For programme measures liable to have a significantly harmful effect on the environment:\n\n-  the procedures which will be applied for assessing individual projects during implementation of  the programme,\n\n-  the mechanisms planned for monitoring environmental impact during implementation, assessing  results and eliminating, reducing or offsetting harmful effects.""}]}"

Whereas for trade in the wines in question between the Community of Ten and Spain and Portugal, and also between Spain and Portugal themselves, it is therefore clearly possible and desirable to provide that the approved commercial document may be  presented in place of the certificate of designation of origin referred to above, provided that it is made out and validated in accordance with Article 9 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 986/89;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) In March 1999, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999(2), imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
(2) Within the framework of this proceeding, the Commission, by Decision 1999/215/EC of 16 March 1999(3), accepted a price undertaking offered by, inter alia, the Hungarian company Tiszai Vegyi Kombinat Rt (""the company"").
(3) Imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Hungary exported to the Community by this company (TARIC Additional Code 8582 ) were exempted from the anti-dumping duty by Article 2(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999.
B. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING
(4) Following changes in its trading activities, the company advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking.
(5) Accordingly, by Commission Decision 2002/890/EC(4), the undertaking by the company has been withdrawn and its name has been removed from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted, in Article 1(1) of Decision 1999/215/EC.
C. DEFINITIVE DUTIES
(6) The investigation which led to the undertaking offered by the company was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and injury by Regulation (EC) No 603/1999.
(7) In accordance with Article 8(9) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, the rate of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed on exports manufactured by the company must be based on the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. In this regard, and in consideration of the fact that the dumping margin established was lower than the injury margin, it is considered appropriate to set the definitive anti-dumping duty rate at a level of 26,4 % ad valorem, corresponding to the dumping margin found (see also recital 26 of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999).
D. AMENDMENT OF REGULATION (EC) No 603/1999
(8) In view of the above, Article 1(2) and Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 603/1999 listing the companies on which anti-dumping duties are imposed and those which are exempted from the anti-dumping duties should be amended,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2011/2002 of 11 November 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 603/1999 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 603/1999 is hereby amended as follows:\n\n1.

The ACP-EC Partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. These are essential elements of the Agreement and thus form the basis for relations between us.\nIn this respect, the European Union has followed closely the transition in Haiti that started with the appointment of the new Interim Government of Haiti, under your leadership, sworn in on 17 March 2004 following an extensive consultation process based on the CARICOM/OAS plan.\nOn 12 May 2004, discussions took place in Brussels between you and the European Commission with a view to examining the political agenda of the Interim Government in relation to the restoration of democratic and constitutional rule. The European Union took note of your commitments particularly as regards the improvements of the human rights situation, the establishment of democratic principles including the holding of free and fair elections, the rule of law and good governance, as stated in your letter of 25 May 2004 to the European Commission. Those binding commitments, which remain valid as essential for our development cooperation, should lead in due course to greater political stability in Haiti.\nThe European Union has been following closely the developments in Haiti on all fronts and has played a very active role in the efforts of the International Community to assist the country on its ambitious and difficult path towards democratic governance. We strongly believe in the entitlement of the Haitian people to a better life, in a secure and stable Haiti where democratic principles, human rights, the rule of law and good governance are fully respected.\nThe European Union, as you know, has played a leading role in the formulation and adoption of the Interim Cooperation Framework and was the largest single donor to make a commitment towards the development of Haiti at the Washington Conference in 2004. Since then, much progress has been made and financial flows are gradually attaining the desired levels as the countries’ capacity to absorb financial and technical assistance has grown.\nThe European Union has worked very closely with all the major international players and has expressed its full support for the UN mission in Haiti, MINUSTAH, and its major efforts to assist the Government and the Haitian National Police to establish the security and stability which are necessary for the country to progress towards elections in the autumn of 2005 and for the successful implementation of sustainable development programmes.\nThe European Union has assessed the progress that has been achieved on the political and economic front, through its own resources and through the Security Council reports on Haiti. We believe the democratic process in Haiti would benefit from additional financial support and we have therefore decided that the measures taken under Decision 2001/131/EC be repealed and that full cooperation be resumed with Haiti with all the instruments available, including possible budgetary aid. Under those measures, the signature of the National Indicative Programme (NIP) for Haiti under the 9th EDF was to have taken place after the national elections and with the new democratically elected government. Currently the programming of the 9th EDF is under way with your Government and the NIP will now be signed as soon as this programming exercise has been completed. It is important for this process to progress rapidly so that the related actions bringing benefits to the Haitian people are also speedily implemented. We wish to underline, however, that our concerns regarding the situation in your country remain.\nIt is essential for the success of the cooperation to ensure a strengthened absorptive capacity for aid, which is currently lacking, through good governance and aid-management capacity building measures. The European Union expects the Interim Government and the forthcoming elected government of Haiti to take the decisive steps in this respect. The methods of implementation will be those adapted to the country’s capacity for adequate management of public finances.\nThe European Union will monitor closely further developments in the democratisation process, in particular in relation to the achievement of the commitments of the Interim Government in the areas of human rights, national dialogue, democratic principles, economic governance and the steps towards local, national and presidential elections. In this respect, the European Union will support the electoral process under way. In this context it expects the Interim Government to take effective action to ensure the respect for human rights and progress in the rule of law — including through steps to end impunity for human rights violations and pursuing further reforms of the Haitian National Police and in the judicial sector. The European Union also urges the Haitian government to continue to pursue an inclusive political dialogue with all political and societal forces renouncing violence with a view to achieving lasting stability and national reconciliation in Haiti. We take note of the possible revision of the electoral calendar with local elections taking place in December 2005 and the National and Presidential Elections taking place in two rounds in November 2005 and January 2006, which would still allow the new Government to assume office in February 2006. The European Union urges the Haitian government to remain committed to the preparations and conduct of free and fair elections underling the importance of avoiding further delays to the electoral timetable. The European Union is itself providing support for the electoral process to the tune of EUR 18 million. Additionally the European Union is considering an Electoral Observation Mission.\nThe European Union will continue its close association with developments in Haiti through continuous and enhanced political dialogue, in the context of the Cotonou Agreement, with your Government and with the new Government that will emerge from the forthcoming elections.\nPlease accept, Sir, the assurance of our highest consideration.\nBrussels,\nFor the Commission\nFor the Council'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC (1), and in particular Article 68(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) A risk assessment on 1,4 dichlorobenzene (hereinafter ‘DCB’) was carried out by the French authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 (2) on the evaluation and control of the risks of the existing substances appearing in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Substances. The final report was published in 2004 on the European Chemicals Bureau website (EC, 2004) (3).
(2) In February 2008, the Commission communication (4) on the results of the risk evaluation and the risk reduction strategies for DCB was published in the Official Journal of the European Union. That communication recommended that, in order to limit the risk for consumers, marketing and use restrictions in Council Directive 76/769/EEC (5) should be considered for the use of DCB in air fresheners, moth repellents and toilet blocks. Restrictions on the use of DCB as a moth repellent, as recommended by that communication in 2008, are already covered by Commission Decision 2007/565/EC (6) (product type 19 — Repellents and attractants) and therefore restriction under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is not necessary for that use.
(3) In November 2011, in accordance with Article 69(1) of that Regulation, the Commission requested the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter ‘the Agency’) to prepare a restriction dossier for DCB conforming to the requirements of Annex XV to that Regulation (hereinafter ‘the Annex XV dossier’).
(4) In its request the Commission specifically asked the Agency to address the exposure of consumers at home and in public toilets, including the exposure of professionals attending or cleaning such toilets, taking into account the most recent and relevant information in scientific literature and the decline of the use of DCB in Europe. The report (7) commissioned by the Commission on the socioeconomic impacts of a restriction of DCB was also to be considered in this assessment.
(5) DCB is listed in part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8) as a carcinogen in hazard category 2, as well as for its eye irritation properties and its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, with long lasting effects. It is estimated that approximately 800 tonnes per year of DCB are used in the Union, for the manufacturing of air fresheners and toilet deodoriser products, of which 10 % is destined for domestic uses and the rest for professional uses (essentially as deodorisers in public toilets).
(6) On 19 April 2012, the Agency submitted to its Committee for Risk Assessment (hereinafter ‘RAC’) and to its Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (hereinafter ‘SEAC’) the Annex XV dossier. In that dossier (9), it was demonstrated that the placing on the market and use of DCB-based air fresheners and toilet blocks should be restricted for both domestic and professional uses as risks associated with them are not adequately controlled and the benefits arising from the restriction outweigh the costs. The dossier further demonstrated that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary.
(7) On 8 March 2013, RAC adopted by consensus its opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the RAC opinion, the restriction is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks posed by DCB used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, homes, offices or other indoor public areas, both in terms of effectiveness and practicability. However, RAC proposed to modify the restriction for enforceability reasons, specifying a concentration limit of 1 % by weight for DCB in such products, thereby avoiding products containing DCB as an impurity being unduly affected. That concentration corresponds to the limit value which triggers classification of a mixture as a category 2 carcinogen under Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008.
(8) As indicated in the background document to the RAC opinion, reliable analytical methods to determine contents of DCB are available on the Union market.
(9) In its assessment, RAC considered that carcinogenicity (mitogen, threshold carcinogen) is the end-point of greatest relevance to the human health. Based on data on inhalation exposure to DCB vapours, RAC proposed to reduce the identified risk to consumers when they use air fresheners and toilet deodorisers, containing DCB, continuously at home. That scenario was considered to represent reasonable worst-case conditions of exposure. In addition, the RAC opinion stated that exposure of professional toilet attendants and cleaners needs to be reduced as risk has been identified where toilets are poorly ventilated.
(10) In analysing the scope of the restriction RAC considered the exposure of consumers to air fresheners and toilet deodorisers in households and in public toilets as well as of professionals who work in public toilets, including toilet attendants and cleaners, but also other groups such as maintenance personnel. Consumers and professionals who visit and work in indoor areas (other than toilets) where air fresheners containing DCB are used were also considered. Other professional or industrial uses were not considered.
(11) On 5 June 2013, SEAC adopted by consensus its opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the SEAC opinion, the restriction, as modified by RAC and SEAC, is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs. Based on the RAC conclusion that exposures to DCB need to be reduced for domestic and professional users and some evidence that use of toilet blocks and air fresheners containing DCB will persist in the absence of any intervention, SEAC agreed that a restriction is an appropriate and an effective measure. Concerning proportionality of a restriction on domestic use, SEAC concluded that the measure is proportionate. Concerning the proportionality of a joint restriction on domestic and professional use, SEAC, taking account of the inferred health benefits and the scale of costs involved, concluded that the measure may not be considered to be disproportionate.
(12) The Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement was consulted during the restrictions process and their comments on the wording of the conditions of the restriction and on the transitional period were taken into consideration by RAC and SEAC.
(13) On 17 June 2013, the Agency submitted to the Commission the opinions of RAC and SEAC, based on which the Commission concludes that an unacceptable risk to human health arises from the placing on the market and use of DCB, as a substance or as a constituent of mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 1 % by weight, used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, homes, offices or other indoor public areas. The Commission further considers that these risks need to be addressed on a Union-wide basis. The socioeconomic impacts of this restriction, including the availability of alternatives, have been taken into account.
(14) It is appropriate to provide for a period of 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation within which stakeholders should take measures to comply with it, including for air fresheners and deodorisers that are already in the supply chain or in stock.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(16) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,","{'header': '9.5.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 136/19', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 474/2014\nof 8 May 2014\namending Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (‘REACH’) as regards 1,4-dichlorobenzene\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) A risk assessment on 1,4 dichlorobenzene (hereinafter ‘DCB’) was carried out by the French authorities in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93(2)on the evaluation and control of the risks of the existing substances appearing in the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Substances. The final report was published in 2004 on the European Chemicals Bureau website (EC, 2004)(3).\n\n((2)) In February 2008, the Commission communication(4)on the results of the risk evaluation and the risk reduction strategies for DCB was published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union. That communication recommended that, in order to limit the risk for consumers, marketing and use restrictions in Council Directive 76/769/EEC(5)should be considered for the use of DCB in air fresheners, moth repellents and toilet blocks. Restrictions on the use of DCB as a moth repellent, as recommended by that communication in 2008, are already covered by Commission Decision 2007/565/EC(6)(product type 19 — Repellents and attractants) and therefore restriction under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is not necessary for that use.\n\n((3)) In November 2011, in accordance with Article 69(1) of that Regulation, the Commission requested the European Chemicals Agency (hereinafter ‘the Agency’) to prepare a restriction dossier for DCB conforming to the requirements of Annex XV to that Regulation (hereinafter ‘the Annex XV dossier’).\n\n((4)) In its request the Commission specifically asked the Agency to address the exposure of consumers at home and in public toilets, including the exposure of professionals attending or cleaning such toilets, taking into account the most recent and relevant information in scientific literature and the decline of the use of DCB in Europe. The report(7)commissioned by the Commission on the socioeconomic impacts of a restriction of DCB was also to be considered in this assessment.\n\n((5)) DCB is listed in part 3 of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council(8)as a carcinogen in hazard category 2, as well as for its eye irritation properties and its high toxicity to aquatic organisms, with long lasting effects. It is estimated that approximately 800 tonnes per year of DCB are used in the Union, for the manufacturing of air fresheners and toilet deodoriser products, of which 10 % is destined for domestic uses and the rest for professional uses (essentially as deodorisers in public toilets).\n\n((6)) On 19 April 2012, the Agency submitted to its Committee for Risk Assessment (hereinafter ‘RAC’) and to its Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (hereinafter ‘SEAC’) the Annex XV dossier. In that dossier(9), it was demonstrated that the placing on the market and use of DCB-based air fresheners and toilet blocks should be restricted for both domestic and professional uses as risks associated with them are not adequately controlled and the benefits arising from the restriction outweigh the costs. The dossier further demonstrated that action on a Union-wide basis is necessary.\n\n((7)) On 8 March 2013, RAC adopted by consensus its opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the RAC opinion, the restriction is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks posed by DCB used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, homes, offices or other indoor public areas, both in terms of effectiveness and practicability. However, RAC proposed to modify the restriction for enforceability reasons, specifying a concentration limit of 1 % by weight for DCB in such products, thereby avoiding products containing DCB as an impurity being unduly affected. That concentration corresponds to the limit value which triggers classification of a mixture as a category 2 carcinogen under Regulation (EC) No\xa01272/2008.\n\n((8)) As indicated in the background document to the RAC opinion, reliable analytical methods to determine contents of DCB are available on the Union market.\n\n((9)) In its assessment, RAC considered that carcinogenicity (mitogen, threshold carcinogen) is the end-point of greatest relevance to the human health. Based on data on inhalation exposure to DCB vapours, RAC proposed to reduce the identified risk to consumers when they use air fresheners and toilet deodorisers, containing DCB, continuously at home. That scenario was considered to represent reasonable worst-case conditions of exposure. In addition, the RAC opinion stated that exposure of professional toilet attendants and cleaners needs to be reduced as risk has been identified where toilets are poorly ventilated.\n\n((10)) In analysing the scope of the restriction RAC considered the exposure of consumers to air fresheners and toilet deodorisers in households and in public toilets as well as of professionals who work in public toilets, including toilet attendants and cleaners, but also other groups such as maintenance personnel. Consumers and professionals who visit and work in indoor areas (other than toilets) where air fresheners containing DCB are used were also considered. Other professional or industrial uses were not considered.\n\n((11)) On 5 June 2013, SEAC adopted by consensus its opinion on the restriction proposed in the Annex XV dossier. According to the SEAC opinion, the restriction, as modified by RAC and SEAC, is the most appropriate Union-wide measure to address the identified risks in terms of the proportionality of its socioeconomic benefits to its socioeconomic costs. Based on the RAC conclusion that exposures to DCB need to be reduced for domestic and professional users and some evidence that use of toilet blocks and air fresheners containing DCB will persist in the absence of any intervention, SEAC agreed that a restriction is an appropriate and an effective measure. Concerning proportionality of a restriction on domestic use, SEAC concluded that the measure is proportionate. Concerning the proportionality of a joint restriction on domestic and professional use, SEAC, taking account of the inferred health benefits and the scale of costs involved, concluded that the measure may not be considered to be disproportionate.\n\n((12)) The Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement was consulted during the restrictions process and their comments on the wording of the conditions of the restriction and on the transitional period were taken into consideration by RAC and SEAC.\n\n((13)) On 17 June 2013, the Agency submitted to the Commission the opinions of RAC and SEAC, based on which the Commission concludes that an unacceptable risk to human health arises from the placing on the market and use of DCB, as a substance or as a constituent of mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 1 % by weight, used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, homes, offices or other indoor public areas. The Commission further considers that these risks need to be addressed on a Union-wide basis. The socioeconomic impacts of this restriction, including the availability of alternatives, have been taken into account.\n\n((14)) It is appropriate to provide for a period of 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation within which stakeholders should take measures to comply with it, including for air fresheners and deodorisers that are already in the supply chain or in stock.\n\n((15)) Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((16)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 133 of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 June 2015.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nIn Annex XVII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, the following entry is added:\n‘64.\n1,4-dichlorobenzene\nCAS No 106-46-7\nEC No 203-400-5\nShall not be placed on the market or used, as a substance or as a constituent of mixtures in a concentration equal to or greater than 1 % by weight, where the substance or the mixture is placed on the market for use or used as an air freshener or deodoriser in toilets, homes, offices or other indoor public areas.’'}]}"

(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of endo-1,4-β-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588). The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application concerns the authorisation of endo-1,4-β-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) as a feed additive for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The use of that preparation was authorised for 10 years for chickens for fattening, laying hens, ducks and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 9/2010 (2).
(5) New data were submitted in support of the application for the authorisation of endo-1,4-β-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening. The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 1 February 2011 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use, endo-1,4-β-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) produced by Trichoderma reesei (ATCC PTA 5588) does not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment, and that its use can improve the zootechnical performance. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof;
Having regard to the Council Decision of 22 June 1964 (1) on the organisation of an inquiry into infrastructure costs for transport by rail, road and inland waterway, and in particular Article 7 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (2);
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3);
Whereas, in order to institute under the common transport policy a system of charging for the use of infrastructure, it is necessary in particular to know what expenditure is incurred in respect of infrastructure ; whereas this knowledge may most appropriately be obtained by the introduction of a permanent accounting system using standard forms of accounts for each mode of transport in all the Member States;
Whereas infrastructure expenditure accounts should cover all infrastructure open to public transport by rail, road and inland waterway ; whereas, however, certain types of infrastructure of secondary importance and certain inland waterways of a maritime character may conveniently be excluded;
Whereas it is appropriate, in order that the special factors and circumstances which vary from case to case can be taken into account, to leave Member States free to lay down the detailed procedures for keeping accounts of infrastructure expenditure;
Whereas, with a view to the institution of a system of charging for the use of infrastructure, returns relating to the use of infrastructure are also required and a schedule of such returns should be drawn up;
Whereas Member States should regularly send the Commission accounts in respect of infrastructure expenditure, and the Commission should present these accounts to the Council in an annual summary;
Whereas, in order to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are applied as uniformly as possible, the Commission should, with the aid of a committee of government experts, co-ordinate the various measures arising out of the Regulation;
Whereas provision should be made for a procedure whereby the forms of accounts, the list of types of infrastructure and the schedule of returns concerning the use of infrastructure may be constantly adjusted in the light of experience and of the development of the common transport policy;
Whereas provision should be made for certain derogations from the general rules in order to take account of the difficulties certain Member States will meet during the initial years of application of this Regulation;","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 1108/70 of the Council of 4 June 1970 introducing an accounting system for expenditure on infrastructure in respect of transport by rail, road and inland waterway', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January 1971, there shall be introduced, in the manner provided for in this Regulation, a standard and permanent accounting system for expenditure on infrastructure in respect of transport by rail, road and inland waterway.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.
