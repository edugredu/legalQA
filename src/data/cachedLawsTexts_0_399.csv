COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 727/2014
of 30 June 2014
initiating a ‘new exporter’ review of Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of trichloroisocyanuric acid originating in the People's Republic of China, repealing the duty with regard to imports from one exporter in this country and making these imports subject to registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
After informing the Member States,
Whereas:
1.   REQUEST
(1) The European Commission (‘Commission’) has received a request for a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.
(2) The request was lodged on 4 January 2014 by Juancheng Kangtai Chemical Co. Ltd (‘the applicant’), an exporting producer in the People's Republic of China (‘PRC’) of trichloroisocyanuric acid.
2.   PRODUCT
(3) The product under review is trichloroisocyanuric acid and preparations thereof (TCCA), also referred to as ‘symclosene’ under the international non-proprietary name (INN), currently falling within CN codes ex 2933 69 80 and ex 3808 94 20 (TARIC codes 2933698070 and 3808942020), and originating in the PRC (‘the product under review’).
3.   EXISTING MEASURES
(4) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011 (2) under which imports into the Union of the product under review originating in the PRC, including the product produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 42,6 % with the exception of several companies specially mentioned in Article 1(2) of that Regulation which are subject to individual duty rates.
4.   GROUNDS
(5) The applicant claims that it did not export the product under review to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (‘the original investigation period’).
(6) Furthermore, the applicant claims that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product under review which are subject to the above-mentioned anti-dumping measures.
(7) The applicant further claims that it has begun exporting the product under review to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.
5.   PROCEDURE
(8) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the request for a review and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(9) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant's individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product under review into the Union shall be subject.
(10) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product under review from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1389/2011.
(a)   Questionnaires
(11) In order to obtain information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(12) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
(13) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c)   Selection of the market economy country
(14) Since the applicant expressly waived the right to claim that market economy conditions prevail for it, normal value shall be determined on the basis of Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. Therefore, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the PRC. The Commission envisages using Japan again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product under review from the PRC. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. According to the information available to the Commission, other market economy suppliers of the Union may be located, inter alia, in Switzerland, Malaysia and Indonesia. The Commission will examine whether there is production and sales of the product under investigation in those market economy third countries for which there are indications that production of the product under investigation is taking place.
6.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(15) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product under review which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date of the initiation of the review. The amount of the applicant's possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
7.   TIME-LIMITS
(16) In the interest of sound administration, time-limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit any information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,
— interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of Japan which is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value,
— Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time-limits indicated in Article 4 of this Regulation.
8.   COMMUNICATION WITH INTERESTED PARTIES
(17) Interested parties are invited to make all submissions and requests by e-mail including scanned powers of attorney and certification sheets, with the exception of voluminous replies which shall be submitted on a CD-ROM or DVD by hand or by registered mail. Their use of e-mail will constitute an agreement for the communication by e-mail and acceptance of the rules specified in the communication instructions with interested parties which are published on the website of the Directorate-General for Trade: http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/june/tradoc_148003.pdf. The interested parties must indicate their name, address, telephone and a valid e-mail address and they should ensure that the provided e-mail address is a functioning official business e-mail which is checked on a daily basis. Once contact details are provided, the Commission will communicate with interested parties by e-mail only, unless they explicitly request to receive all documents from the Commission by another means of communication or unless the nature of the document to be sent requires the use of a registered mail. For further rules and information concerning correspondence with the Commission including principles that apply to submissions by e-mail, interested parties should consult the communication instructions with interested parties referred to above.
(18) All written submissions, including the information requested in this Regulation, questionnaire replies and correspondence provided by interested parties on a confidential basis must be labelled as ‘Limited’ and, in accordance with Article 19(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009, must be accompanied by a non-confidential version, which must be labelled ‘For inspection by interested parties’.

9.   NON-COOPERATION
(19) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time-limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(20) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available.
(21) If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
(22) Failure to give a computerised response shall not be deemed to constitute non-cooperation, provided that the interested party shows that presenting the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden or unreasonable additional cost. The interested party should immediately contact the Commission.
10.   SCHEDULE OF THE INVESTIGATION
(23) The investigation will be concluded, pursuant to Article 11(5) of the basic Regulation, within nine months of the date of initiation of this review.
11.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(24) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).
12.   HEARING OFFICER
(25) Interested parties may request the intervention of the Hearing Officer of the Directorate-General for Trade. The Hearing Officer acts as an interface between the interested parties and the Commission investigation services. The Hearing Officer reviews requests for access to the file, disputes regarding the confidentiality of documents, requests for extension of time-limits and requests by third parties to be heard. The Hearing Officer may organise a hearing with an individual interested party and mediate to ensure that the interested party's rights of defence are being fully exercised. The Hearing Officer will also provide opportunities for a hearing involving parties to take place which would allow different views to be presented and rebuttal arguments offered.
(26) A request for a hearing with the Hearing Officer should be made in writing and should specify the reasons for the request. For hearings on issues pertaining to the initial stage of the investigation the request must be submitted within 15 days of the date of entry into force of this Regulation. Thereafter, a request to be heard must be submitted within specific deadlines set by the Commission in its communication with the parties.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament (1);
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 (2) of 9 December 1969 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits, as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 175/73 (3), provides for the granting of additional aid to small farmers to compensate for part of the loss of income caused by replanting;
Whereas one of the conditions for the granting of this aid is that the area of the undertaking does not exceed five hectares ; whereas, when the total area of the undertaking exceeds five hectares but the area fit for agricultural use does not exceed that limit since the rest of the land is not cultivable, the farmer's economic situation is the same as in the cases mentioned in the Regulation ; whereas all farmers of an area fit for agricultural use not exceeding five hectares should receive identical treatment;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 set up in particular a scheme of financial compensation to promote sales of Community-produced oranges and mandarins on Community import markets by means of contracts ensuring regular supplies for these markets;
Whereas experience has shown that the contractual scheme referred to above has not had the desired results as regards the growth of Community outlets for the products in question ; whereas, moreover, the increase in competition from certain producer third countries can only make it more difficult to market Community-produced citrus fruit on the Community market;
Whereas to counter these difficulties Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 should be modified by discontinuing the contractual scheme and increasing the amounts of financial compensation ; whereas this compensation should be extended to include clementines;
Whereas during the recent marketing years there have also been problems as regards the distribution of Community lemon production on the Community import markets ; whereas, therefore, it is advisable, as a precautionary measure, to grant financial compensation in respect of this product for the remainder of the 1975/76 marketing year;
Whereas, in order to ensure the effectiveness of such a system, provision should be made for bringing up to date the amounts fixed in respect of oranges, mandarins and clementines, taking into account the trend of the basic and buying-in prices for the products concerned,","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 2481/75 of the Council of 29 September 1975 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 laying down special measures for improving the production and marketing of Community citrus fruits', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe first indent of Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n""- the area of their undertaking which is fit for agricultural use does not exceed five hectares,""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe text of Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 2511/69 shall be replaced by the following:  (1)Opinion delivered on September 1975 (not yet published in the Official Journal).

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (1), and in particular Article 10(2) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Own Resources,
Whereas:
(1) The compensation to the VAT resources base is based on Article 6(4) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, which provides that where a Member State restricts or excludes, on the basis of Article 176 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (2), the right to deduct input VAT, then the VAT own resources base may be determined as if the right of deduction had not been restricted. This applies only in respect of the purchase of passenger cars and their fuel used for business purposes, and of expenditure relating to the lease, hire, maintenance and repair of such cars. Austria proposed a multipart draft solution for such compensation to its VAT own resources base, which includes a method for six sub-categories.
(2) Pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, the solution proposed by Austria was examined in its entirety by the Advisory Committee on Own Resources at its meeting on 10 December 2009. The examination revealed a difference of opinion in the Committee regarding one of the sub-categories of the solution. That sub-category concerns the methodology proposed for the calculation of the private use component of the compensation to the harmonised VAT own resources base. A draft decision declining that sub-category of the solution presented by Austria was submitted to the Advisory Committee on Own Resources which delivered a positive opinion on 10 December 2009.
(3) When calculating private use, in the absence of actual data, alternative methods can be used. To guarantee that these methods contribute to uniformity in the calculation of the compensation they should be based on generally accepted assumptions.
(4) Austria requires taxable persons to administer actual data about the private use of business cars. However, for reasons of administrative simplicity, Austria has proposed a solution for the calculation of private use incorporating general statistical data combined with depreciation rules devised for non-harmonised corporate income tax purposes. Since the proposed solution results in a private use element significantly lower than the proportion used by other Member States, it is contradictory to the required uniformity in the calculation of the compensation. The solution proposed by Austria concerning the calculation of the private use proportion of cars acquired by businesses needs therefore to be declined,","{'header': '7.1.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 3/22', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 December 2009\ndeclining the solution proposed by Austria under Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 relating to the calculation of a compensation to the VAT own resources base resulting from the restriction of the right to deduct VAT under Article 176 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC\n(notified under document C(2009) 10428)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(2010/8/EU, Euratom)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The compensation to the VAT resources base is based on Article 6(4) of Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89, which provides that where a Member State restricts or excludes, on the basis of Article 176 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax(2), the right to deduct input VAT, then the VAT own resources base may be determined as if the right of deduction had not been restricted.

COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 of 10 July 1975 on the importation free of Common Customs Tariff duties of educational, scientific and cultural materials (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1027/79 (2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 of 12 December 1979 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas, by letter dated 10 September 1981, the United Kingdom requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the 'Jodon EA - immersion type X-Y micropositionable photographic plate holder, model MPH-45W, with beam splitter attenuator, model UBA-200 and parabolic mirrors', intended for use in teaching experimental techiques of holography and related laser-based methods as well as for general research in the same fields, should be considered as a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 (2), and in particular Article 84 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious, usually fatal, viral disease of domestic and feral pigs which causes serious disturbances to intra-Union trade in and export to third countries of live pigs and products derived from animals of the porcine species.
(2) Following the confirmation of ASF in Georgia in 2007, the disease spread to the Russian Federation where numerous outbreaks of that disease have been reported in pigs and wild boar throughout the European part of Russia. In June 2013, Belarus reported the confirmation of an outbreak of ASF in backyard pigs in the region of Grodno, some forty kilometres from the Lithuanian border and close to the border with Poland.
(3) Commission Implementing Decision 2013/498/EU (3) provided for a Union financial contribution towards surveillance and other emergency measures against ASF implemented in 2013 in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, which are the Member States at direct threat of ASF introduction.
(4) In January 2014 the disease has been reported in the wild boar population in Ukraine and it is still spreading in Belarus and in the Russian Federation. Furthermore, in January 2014 two ASF cases were detected in the wild boar population in Lithuania and after few days two further cases were reported in the wild boar in Poland. In both Member States the disease occurred at the border with Belarus. Therefore, the ASF situation in countries bordering the European Union represents a persistent threat to pig holdings within the Union, due to the fact that the virus may be introduced into Member States bordering the infected third countries through wild boar entering Union territory from infected areas, but also through vehicles which have transported live animals or through the unauthorised introduction into the Union of products derived from animals of the porcine species.
(5) The risk of ASF introduction into the Union is higher for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland due to the occurrence and the evolution of this disease in the bordering territory of Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These Member States have informed the Commission and the other Member States of the measures that they intend to adopt to strengthen the protection of their territories and of other Member States.
(6) During 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland implemented surveillance for the early detection of ASF both in wild boar and domestic pigs. In order to better prevent ASF, certain surveillance activities need to be carried out in the territory of those Member States.
(7) Cleansing and disinfection of vehicles that were possibly in contact with the ASF virus is one of the main precautionary measures against the entry of ASF into the Union. Therefore, Commission Implementing Decision 2013/426/EU (4) lays down certain measures to prevent the introduction into the Union of ASF from Belarus and the Russian Federation and establishes that vehicles which have transported live animals and which enter the Union from infected areas are appropriately cleansed and disinfected.
(8) Notwithstanding the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2009 (5), the risk of ASF introduction into the Union by personal consignments containing pig products sent by post or carried in the baggage of travellers arriving in particular from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, is higher than negligible and requires additional actions and controls at the points of entry.
(9) In addition, a wide range of stakeholders including veterinarians, professional and non-professional farmers, truck drivers, custom agents, passengers and the general public should be made aware of the risks of ASF introduction and its consequences by means of well-targeted awareness campaigns to raise disease awareness and preparedness in the framework of the contingency plans drawn up in accordance with Council Directive 2002/60/EC (6) to ensure a rapid response should ASF be introduced.
(10) In 2014 ASF has been detected in the wild boar Lithuania and Poland and the two Member States are directly threatened by the presence of ASF across the border in Belarus. In order to minimise the risk of disease spread on their territory, Lithuania and Poland intend to decrease the density of susceptible hosts in low bio-security pig holdings of the infected area by promoting the slaughter of pigs and preventing restocking of pig holdings for at least one year. In December 2013 Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland submitted their respective plans and cost estimates for the implementation of emergency measures during 2014 in the areas considered at higher risk of introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine. These plans have been examined by the Commission for Union financial contribution and were found to comply with Directive 2002/60/EC.
(11) The actions undertaken by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for disease surveillance, cleansing and disinfection of vehicles and for the organisation of awareness campaigns are co-financed at a rate of 50 %.
(12) The actions undertaken by Lithuania and Poland to decrease the density of pigs in the infected areas at the border with Belarus should be co-financed at a rate of 30 %.
(13) As the planned measures submitted by Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland for emergency measures against the introduction of ASF from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine to be carried out in 2014 are a sufficiently detailed framework in the meaning of Article 94 of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 (7), the present decision constitutes a financing decision for the expenditure provided for in the work programme for grants.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '26.4.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 125/86', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 24 April 2014\nconcerning a Union financial contribution towards surveillance and other emergency measures implemented in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland against African swine fever\n(notified under document C(2014) 2551)\n(Only the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish texts are authentic)\n(2014/236/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious, usually fatal, viral disease of domestic and feral pigs which causes serious disturbances to intra-Union trade in and export to third countries of live pigs and products derived from animals of the porcine species.\n\n((2)) Following the confirmation of ASF in Georgia in 2007, the disease spread to the Russian Federation where numerous outbreaks of that disease have been reported in pigs and wild boar throughout the European part of Russia.

of 22 December 2005
fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.\n\n((5)) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC(4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011\xa000 and 1902\xa019 according to their destination.\n\n((6)) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93(5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.\n\n((7)) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.\n\n((8)) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 and in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003, and exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 respectively, shall be fixed as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 23 December 2005.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nRates of the refunds applicable from 23 December 2005 to certain cereals and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n(\n*1\n)\n(EUR/100\xa0kg)\nCN code\nDescription of products\n(\n1\n)\nRate of refund per 100\xa0kg of basic product\nIn case of advance fixing of refunds\nOther\n1001\xa010\xa000\nDurum wheat:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1001\xa090\xa099\nCommon wheat and meslin:\n– on exports of goods falling within CN codes 1902\xa011  and 1902\xa019  to the United States of America\n—\n—\n– in other cases:\n– – where Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 applies\n(\n2\n)\n—\n—\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– – in other cases\n—\n—\n1002\xa000\xa000\nRye\n—\n—\n1003\xa000\xa090\nBarley\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n—\n—\n– in other cases\n—\n—\n1004\xa000\xa000\nOats\n—\n—\n1005\xa090\xa000\nMaize (corn) used in the form of:\n– starch:\n– – where Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 applies\n(\n2\n)\n2,687\n2,687\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n1,714\n1,714\n– – in other cases\n3,499\n3,499\n– glucose, glucose syrup, maltodextrine, maltodextrine syrup of CN codes 1702\xa030\xa051 , 1702\xa030\xa059 , 1702\xa030\xa091 , 1702\xa030\xa099 , 1702\xa040\xa090 , 1702\xa090\xa050 , 1702\xa090\xa075 , 1702\xa090\xa079 , 2106\xa090\xa055\n(\n4\n)\n:\n– – where Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 applies\n(\n2\n)\n1,812\n1,812\n– – where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n1,286\n1,286\n– – in other cases\n2,624\n2,624\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n1,714\n1,714\n– other (including unprocessed)\n3,499\n3,499\nPotato starch of CN code 1108\xa013\xa000  similar to a product obtained from processed maize:\n– where Article 15(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 applies\n(\n2\n)\n2,133\n2,133\n– where goods falling within subheading 2208\n(\n3\n)\nare exported\n1,714\n1,714\n– in other cases\n3,499\n3,499\nex\xa01006\xa030\nWholly milled rice:\n– round grain\n—\n—\n– medium grain\n—\n—\n– long grain\n—\n—\n1006\xa040\xa000\nBroken rice\n—\n—\n1007\xa000\xa090\nGrain sorghum, other than hybrid for sowing\n—\n—\n(\n*1\n)\nThe rates set out in this Annex are not applicable to exports to Bulgaria with effect from 1 October 2004, to Romania with effect from 1 December 2005, and to the goods listed in Tables I and II to Protocol No 2 to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation of 22 July 1972 exported to the Swiss Confederation or to the Principality of Liechtenstein with effect from 1\xa0February 2005.\n(\n1\n)\nAs far as agricultural products obtained from the processing of a basic product or/and assimilated products are concerned, the coefficients set out in Annex V to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 is applicable.\n(\n2\n)\nThe goods concerned fall under CN code 3505\xa010\xa050.\n(\n3\n)\nGoods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or referred to in Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 2825/93 (\nOJ L 258, 16.10.1993, p. 6\n).\n(\n4\n)\nFor syrups of CN codes NC 1702\xa030\xa099, 1702\xa040\xa090 and 1702\xa060\xa090, obtained from mixing glucose and fructose syrup, the export refund relates only to the glucose syrup.'}]}"

Whereas the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic was dissolved with effect from 1 January 1993; whereas, as successor States to the Czech and Slovak Federal Repbulic, the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic will continue to assume all obligations  arising from all agreements between the Czecvh and Slovak Federal Republic and the European Communities, and in particular from the Interim Agreement; whereas the said Interim Agreement was amended by additional protocols and by supplementary protocols  concluded with the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/457/EEC of 29 September 1970 on the common catalogue of varieties of agricultural plant species [1], as last amended by Council Directive 79/967/EEC of 12 November 1979 [2], and in particular Article 15 (2), (3) and (7) thereof,
Having regard to the application lodged by the Federal Republic of Germany,
Whereas under Article 15 (1) of the said Directive, seed or propagating material of varieties of agricultural plant species which have been officially accepted during 1977 in one or more Member States and which also meet the conditions laid down in the said Directive are, with effect from 31 December 1979, no longer subject to any marketing restrictions relating to variety in the Community;
Whereas, however, Article 15 (2) thereof provides that a Member State may be authorized upon application to prohibit the marketing of seed and propagating material of certain varieties;
Whereas the Federal Republic of Germany has applied for such authorization for a certain number of varieties of different species;
Whereas the variety Kaweintermono (sugar beet) and the concerned varieties of oats and of maize have not been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany in view of the German application;
Whereas the said variety of sugar beet has been the subject in the Federal Republic of Germany of an application for official acceptance in so far as their seed is to be marketed in another country (Article 4 (2) (b) thereof); whereas therefore even the applicant has not claimed that this variety has any satisfactory value for cultivation or use in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas therefore this variety can be treated as not producing results in the Federal Republic of Germany, which, with respect to their qualities taken as a whole as regards their value for cultivation or use, correspond to those obtained from a comparable variety accepted there (first subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) thereof);
Whereas the variety of oats concerned is of the winter type; whereas the varieties of maize concerned have an FAO maturity class index over 350; whereas it is well known that the varieties of winter oats and the varieties of maize which have an FAO maturity class over 350 are at present not yet suitable for cultivation in view of all the kinds of utilization in the Federal Republic of Germany (second subparagraph of Article 15 (3) (c) of the said Directive);
Whereas the other varieties listed in this Decision have been the subject of official growing trials in the Federal Republic of Germany; whereas the results of these trials have led the Federal Republic of Germany to decide that these varieties are not distinct or that their value for cultivation or use does not correspond to other varieties accepted in the Federal Republic of Germany;
Whereas, in respect of the varieties Bergond (Red fescue) and Goal (Perennial rye grass), the results of the trials show that in the Federal Republic of Germany, when compared with the national rules governing the acceptance of varieties there, which apply within the framework of current Community provisions, they are not distinct from other varieties accepted there (Article 15 (3) (a) thereof);
Whereas therefore the application of the Federal Republic of Germany in respect of all these varieties should be granted in full; whereas some of the concerned varieties of maize are acceptable in the Federal Republic of Germany in so far as their seeds are intended for fodder production (green fodder);
Whereas, in respect of the other cases the application of the Federal Republic of Germany is under examination by the Commission; whereas it is not possible to complete examination of the abovementioned variety before expiry of the period provided for in Article 15 (1) of the said Directive;
Whereas it consequently seems desirable to extend for the Federal Republic of Germany the period in question for an appropriate time to permit a full examination of the request for those varieties (Article 15 (7) of the said Directive);
Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Seed and Propagating Material for Agriculture, Horticulture and Forestry,","{'title': '80/126/EEC: Commission Decision of 28 December 1979 authorizing the Federal Republic of Germany to restrict the marketing of seed of certain varieties of agricultural plant species (Only the German text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,

(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The German Government submitted to the Commission on 26 April 2000 an acceptable draft single programming document for the regions in Bavaria fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and those qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The draft contains the information listed in Article 16 of the Regulation, and in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF).
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000, the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible is 1 January 2000.

fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.
(6) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal(1), and in particular Article 28(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The application of intervention measures in respect of beef has resulted in a build-up of stocks in several Member States. In order to prevent storage being prolonged excessively, part of those stocks should be put up for sale by periodical tender.
(2) The sale should be conducted in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 of 4 October 1979 on detailed rules of application for the disposal of beef bought in by intervention agencies and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 216/69(2), and in particular Titles II and III thereof.
(3) In the light of the frequency and nature of tenders pursuant to this Regulation it is necessary to derogate from Articles 6 and 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 with regard to the information and deadlines to be provided by the notice of invitation to tender.
(4) In order to ensure that the sales by tender are conducted properly and uniformly, measures in addition to those provided for in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 should be adopted.
(5) Provisions should be made for derogations from Article 8(2)(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79 in view of the administrative difficulties which the application of that point is creating in the Member States concerned.
(6) In order to ensure a proper functioning of the tender arrangements it is necessary to provide for a higher amount of security than the one fixed in Article 15(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2173/79.
(7) On the basis of experience gained with regard to the disposal of bone-in intervention beef, it is necessary to reinforce the quality controls of the products before their delivery to the purchasers, in particular to ensure that the products comply with the provisions in Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 562/2000 of 15 March 2000 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 as regards the buying-in of beef(3).

Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 of 12 December 1979 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas, by letter dated 27 September 1982, the Federal Republic of Germany has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as 'Ithaco - Lock-in Amplifier, model Dynatrac 393 with accessories', ordered in March 1982 and intended to be used for the study of the surface properties of thin films of organic molecules by means of photo-acoustic spectroscopy and, in particular, for the registration and amplification of photo-acoustic signals and interference suppression, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;
Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79, a group of experts composed of representatives of all the Member States met on 2 February 1983, within the framework of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements, to examine the matter;
Whereas this examination showed that the apparatus in question is an amplifier;
Whereas its objective technical characteristics, such as the very high suppression of the signal and noise harmonics, and the use to which it is put make it specially suited to scientific research; whereas, moreover, apparatus of the same kind are principally used for scientific activities; whereas it must therefore be considered to be a scientific apparatus;
Whereas, however, on the basis of information received from Member States, apparatus of scientific value equivalent to the said apparatus, capable of being used for the same purposes, are currently being manufactured in the Community; whereas this applies, in particular, to the apparatus 'TE 9602' manufacured by Tekelec Airtronic SA, rue Carle-Vernet, F-92310 SĂ¨vres and to the apparatus '5205' and 5206' manufactured by Brookdeal Electronics Ltd, Doncaster House, Doncaster Road, UK-Bracknell RG12 4PG, Berks,","{'title': ""83/173/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 April 1983 establishing that the apparatus described as 'Ithaco - Lock-in Amplifier, model Dynatrac 393 with accessories' may not be imported free of Common Customs Tariff duties"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe apparatus described as 'Ithaco - Lock-in Amplifier, model Dynatrac 393 with accessories', which is the subject of an application by the Federal Republic of Germany of 27 September 1982, may not be imported free of Common Customs Tariff duties.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 April 1983.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nKarl-Heinz NARJES\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 184, 15. 7. 1975, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 74, 18. 3. 1982, p. 4.\n\n(3) OJ No L 318, 13. 12. 1979, p. 32.'}]}"

(2014/666/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC (1), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (2), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Sustainability of Biofuels and Bioliquids,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(4) The request to recognise that the ‘Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops’ demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Directive 98/70/EC and Directive 2009/28/EC was first submitted to the Commission on 16 May 2011. The updated version of the scheme was submitted on 7 February 2014. The scheme operates in the United Kingdom and can cover combinable crops, such as cereals, oilseeds and sugar beet. This scheme covers the trading, transport and storage stages of agricultural feedstock from farm gate to first processor and, for the other stages, relies on other voluntary schemes recognised by the Commission. As such, it is the responsibility of the ‘Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops’ to ensure that the recognition issued by the Commission on those schemes with which it jointly operates remains valid during the length of cooperation. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC.
(5) Assessment of the ‘Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops’ scheme found it to cover adequately all the sustainability criteria of Directive 98/70/EC and of Directive 2009/28/EC, except Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC. It does, however, provide accurate data on elements that are required by economic operators downstream the chain of custody to demonstrate compliance with Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC and applies a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(6) The evaluation of the ‘Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops’ found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing.
(7) The ‘Trade Assurance Scheme for Combinable Crops’ was assessed against legislation in force at the time of the adoption of this Decision. In the case of relevant changes in the legal basis the Commission should assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme still adequately covers the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.
(8) In the case of changes in the scheme the Commission should assess the scheme with a view to establish whether the scheme is still adequately covering the sustainability criteria for which it is recognised.

(2) Much progress has been made in recent years towards the establishment of the CEAS, thanks to the introduction of common minimum standards. There remain great disparities between the Member States, however, in the granting of international protection and the forms that such protection takes.
(3) In its Policy Plan on Asylum, adopted in June 2008, the Commission announced its intention to develop the CEAS by proposing a revision of the existing legal instruments in order to achieve greater harmonisation of the applicable standards and by strengthening support for practical cooperation between the Member States, in particular, by a legislative proposal to establish a European Asylum Support Office (the Support Office) in order to increase coordination of operational cooperation between Member States so that the common rules are implemented effectively.
(4) In the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum, adopted in September 2008, the European Council solemnly reiterated that any persecuted foreigner is entitled to obtain aid and protection on the territory of the European Union in application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, and other relevant treaties. It was also expressly agreed that a European support office would be established in 2009.
(5) Practical cooperation on asylum aims to increase convergence and ensure ongoing quality of Member States’ decision-making procedures in that area, within a European legislative framework. A substantial number of practical cooperation measures have already been undertaken in recent years, notably the adoption of a common approach to information on countries of origin and the establishment of a common European asylum curriculum. The Support Office should be established in order to strengthen and develop those cooperation measures.
(6) In the interests of simplifying actions to support practical cooperation on asylum matters, and in so far as the Support Office should be entrusted with some of the tasks that are currently financed under the European Refugee Fund, it is necessary to transfer responsibility for some of the Community actions provided for in Article 4 of Decision No 573/2007/EC (2) from the European Refugee Fund to the Support Office in order to ensure the best possible practical cooperation on asylum matters.
(7) In order to take account of the reduced scope of the Community actions, the limit for their funding laid down in Decision No 573/2007/EC should be reduced from 10 % of the Fund’s available resources to 4 % thereof.
(8) The financial envelope for the implementation of Decision No 573/2007/EC should be reduced in order to free up resources for funding the Support Office.
(9) In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Decision.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Articles 3d(3) and 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community (2), allows Member States not participating in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) to appoint their own auction platform for the auctioning of their share of the volume of allowances covered by Chapters II and III of Directive 2003/87/EC. The appointment of such auction platforms is subject to listing of the auction platform concerned in Annex III, pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 30(5) of that Regulation.
(2) In accordance with Article 30(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, Germany informed the Commission of its decision not to participate in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) of that Regulation, and to appoint its own auction platform.
(3) On 9 March 2012, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to appoint European Energy Exchange AG (‘EEX’) as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010.
(4) On 22 March 2012, Germany presented the notification to the Climate Change Committee. In addition, Germany has provided further information and clarification to the Commission, supplementing the notification accordingly.
(5) The proposed appointment of EEX as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 is compatible with the requirements of that Regulation and is in conformity with the objectives set out in Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.
(6) In accordance with point (e) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, an auction platform must not abuse the contract appointing it to unduly leverage the competitiveness of its other activities, notably the secondary market it organises. Therefore, the listing of EEX as an auction platform should be conditional upon EEX providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become a member of or a participant in the secondary market organised by EEX or of any other trading place operated by EEX or by any third party.
(7) In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010, when appointing an auction platform, the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform’s successor. Such measures should be laid down in a clear and timely manner in an exit strategy that should be reviewed by the auction monitor. EEX should develop such an exit strategy and take into utmost account the auction monitor’s opinion thereon.
(8) An auction platform is required to obtain the auction monitor’s opinion on the methodology for the application of Articles 7(6) and 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010. However, where the auction monitor has not been appointed before the start of the auction concerned, the auction platform should be allowed to proceed without having obtained the auction monitor’s opinion.
(9) Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(11) In order to ensure predictable and timely auctions by the auction platform to be appointed by Germany, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.
(12) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,","{'header': '31.8.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 234/4', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 784/2012\nof 30 August 2012\namending Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 to list an auction platform to be appointed by Germany and correcting Article 59(7) thereof\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010 of 12 November 2010 on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning of greenhouse gas emission allowances pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowances trading within the Community(2), allows Member States not participating in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) to appoint their own auction platform for the auctioning of their share of the volume of allowances covered by Chapters II and III of Directive 2003/87/EC. The appointment of such auction platforms is subject to listing of the auction platform concerned in Annex III, pursuant to the third paragraph of Article 30(5) of that Regulation.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article 30(4) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010, Germany informed the Commission of its decision not to participate in the joint action as provided in Article 26(1) and (2) of that Regulation, and to appoint its own auction platform.\n\n((3)) On 9 March 2012, Germany notified the Commission of its intention to appoint European Energy Exchange AG (‘EEX’) as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010.\n\n((4)) On 22 March 2012, Germany presented the notification to the Climate Change Committee. In addition, Germany has provided further information and clarification to the Commission, supplementing the notification accordingly.\n\n((5)) The proposed appointment of EEX as an auction platform referred to in Article 30(2) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010 is compatible with the requirements of that Regulation and is in conformity with the objectives set out in Article 10(4) of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\n((6)) In accordance with point (e) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010, an auction platform must not abuse the contract appointing it to unduly leverage the competitiveness of its other activities, notably the secondary market it organises. Therefore, the listing of EEX as an auction platform should be conditional upon EEX providing the option to candidate bidders to be admitted to bid in the auctions without being required to become a member of or a participant in the secondary market organised by EEX or of any other trading place operated by EEX or by any third party.\n\n((7)) In accordance with point (h) of Article 35(3) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010, when appointing an auction platform, the Member States have to take into account the extent to which adequate measures are provided to require an auction platform to hand over all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the conduct of the auctions by an auction platform’s successor. Such measures should be laid down in a clear and timely manner in an exit strategy that should be reviewed by the auction monitor. EEX should develop such an exit strategy and take into utmost account the auction monitor’s opinion thereon.\n\n((8)) An auction platform is required to obtain the auction monitor’s opinion on the methodology for the application of Articles 7(6) and 8(3) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010. However, where the auction monitor has not been appointed before the start of the auction concerned, the auction platform should be allowed to proceed without having obtained the auction monitor’s opinion.\n\n((9)) Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((10)) Moreover, certain references in Article 59(7) of Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010 should be corrected.\n\n((11)) In order to ensure predictable and timely auctions by the auction platform to be appointed by Germany, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Climate Change Committee,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Amendments to Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010', 'text': 'Article 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010\nRegulation (EU) No\xa01031/2010 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 3, the following point is added:\n‘44.\n“exit strategy” means one or more documents determined in accordance with the contracts appointing the auction monitor or the auction platform concerned, setting out detailed measures planned to ensure the following:\n(a)\nthe transfer of all tangible and intangible assets necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of the auctions and the smooth operation of the auction process by an auction platform’s successor;\n(b)\nthe provision to the contracting authorities or the auction monitor, or both, of all information relating to the auction process, that is necessary for the procurement procedure for the appointment of the auction platform’s successor;\n(c)\nthe provision to the contracting authorities, or the auction monitor or the auction platform’s successor, or any combination of these, of the technical assistance that enables the contracting authorities, or the auction monitor or the auction platform’s successor, or any combination of these, to understand, access or use the relevant information provided pursuant to points (a) and (b).’;\n(2)\nin Article 7, paragraph 7 is replaced by the following:\n‘7.\xa0\xa0\xa0Before an auction is started, the auction platform shall determine the methodology for the application of paragraph 6, after consulting the auction monitor and obtaining its opinion thereon and notifying the competent national authorities referred to in Article 56.\nIn between two bidding windows on the same auction platform, the auction platform concerned may modify the methodology after having consulted the auction monitor, obtained its opinion thereon, and notified the competent national authorities referred to in Article 56.\nWhere the auction monitor has not been appointed at least one month prior to the start of the auction concerned, the auction platform may apply the intended methodology without having obtained the auction monitor’s opinion.\nThe auction platform concerned shall take the utmost account of the auction monitor’s opinion.’;\n(3)\nin Article 8, paragraph 3, the following subparagraph is added:\n‘Where the auction monitor has not yet been appointed at least one month prior to the start of the auction concerned, the auction platform may proceed with the intended change of time.’;\n(4)\nin Article 25, paragraph 6 is replaced by the following:\n‘6.\xa0\xa0\xa0The auction monitor shall provide opinions pursuant to Articles 7(7) and 8(3), and as provided in Annex III.

of 27 March 2006
amending Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of colour television receivers originating, inter alia, in the People's Republic of China
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) In August 2002, by Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of colour television receivers (the product concerned) originating, inter alia, in the People's Republic of China (the PRC).
(2) In parallel, the Commission, by Decision 2002/683/EC (3), accepted a joint undertaking (the undertaking) offered by Haier Electrical Appliances Corp. Ltd, Hisense Import & Export Co. Ltd, Konka Group Co. Ltd, Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. Ltd, Skyworth Multimedia International (Shenzen) Co. Ltd, TCL King Electrical Appliances (Hui Zhou) Co. Ltd and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd, (the Companies) in conjunction with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronics Products (CCCME).
(3) As a result, imports into the Community of the product concerned of PRC origin, produced by the Companies, and of a type covered by the undertaking (the product covered by the undertaking), were exempt from the definitive anti-dumping duties.
B.   FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING
(4) The undertaking offered by the Companies obliges them to, inter alia, export the product covered by the undertaking to the first independent customer in the Community at, or above, certain minimum import price levels (MIPs) and to respect certain quantitative ceilings laid down in the undertaking. These price levels and ceilings eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
(5) For the purposes of ensuring compliance with the undertaking, CCCME and the Companies also agreed to provide all information considered necessary by the Commission and to allow on-the-spot verification visits at their premises in order to verify the accuracy and veracity of data submitted in the said quarterly reports.
(6) As noted in recital 239 of Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002, the undertaking specifically provides that a breach by any of the Companies or the CCCME shall be considered as a breach of the undertaking by all signatories. Failure to cooperate with the European Commission in monitoring the undertaking is considered as a breach of the undertaking.
(7) In this regard, the Commission requested to carry out on-the-spot verification visits at the premises of CCCME and of the two companies with the largest reported volume of sales of the product concerned, namely Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd and Konka Group Co. Ltd. The Commission sent pre-verification letters to CCCME, Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd and Konka Group Co. Ltd with an indication of the dates for the on-the-spot verification. The CCCME and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co. Ltd confirmed the acceptance of the on-the-spot verification visit requested by the Commission. However, Konka Group Co. Ltd refused to accept an on-the-spot verification visit, thereby breaching the undertaking.
(8) Commission Decision 2006/258/EC (4) sets out in more detail the nature of the breach found.
(9) In view of the breach, acceptance of the undertaking offered by the Companies in conjunction with the CCCME has been withdrawn by Decision No 2006/258/EC. A definitive anti-dumping duty should therefore be imposed forthwith on imports of the product concerned exported to the Community by the companies concerned.
(10) In accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation, the rate of the anti-dumping duty must be established on the basis of the facts established within the context of the investigation which led to the undertaking. As the investigation in question was concluded by a final determination as to dumping and resulting injury by Regulation (EC) No 1531/2002, it is considered appropriate that the definitive anti-dumping rate be set at the level and in the form imposed by that Regulation, namely 44,6 % of the net, cif free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty.

(1) Directive 96/23/EC lays down measures to monitor the substances and groups of residues listed in Annex I thereto. Pursuant to Directive 96/23/EC, the inclusion and retention on the lists of third countries from which Member States are authorised to import animals and primary products of animal origin covered by that Directive, are subject to submission by the third countries concerned of a plan setting out the guarantees which they offer as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in that Directive.
(2) Commission Decision 2004/432/EC of 29 April 2004 on the approval of residue monitoring plans submitted by third countries in accordance with Council Directive 96/23/EC (2) lists those third countries which have submitted a residue monitoring plan, setting out the guarantees offered by them in compliance with the requirements of that Directive.
(3) Serbia has presented residue monitoring plans to the Commission for animals and products of animal origin not currently listed in Decision 2004/432/EC. The evaluation of those plans and the additional information obtained by the Commission provide sufficient guarantees on the residue monitoring in that third country for the animals and products concerned. The relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be included in the list for Serbia in that Decision.
(4) Greenland, Namibia and Paraguay have asked not to be included in the list in Decision 2004/432/EC for certain categories of animals and products of animal origin. The entries concerning the relevant animals and products of animal origin should therefore be deleted from the list for those third countries.
(5) Costa Rica and Vietnam, which are currently listed for certain animals or products of animal origin under Decision 2004/432/EC, have not submitted to the Commission the requested guarantees for some of these animals and products of animal origin. Moreover Food and Veterinary Office inspections in those third countries have revealed serious deficiencies concerning the residue monitoring for the animals and products concerned. The entries for the relevant animals and products of animal origin for those third countries should therefore be deleted in the list. The third countries concerned have been informed accordingly.

amending Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 on development cooperation with South Africa
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 179 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on development cooperation with South Africa (2) the Commission is to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a mid-term review by 31 October 2003. On the basis of that mid-term review, certain amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 have been suggested.
(2) The mid-term review includes suggestions and proposals for improving the implementation of development cooperation with South Africa, some of which were already made in the Country Strategy Paper of 2002 and have been taken into account in the 2003 to 2005 Indicative Programme. They concern, inter alia, mainstreaming of gender issues at all levels of the project cycle from planning to implementation, streamlining of administrative procedures, improving criteria for assessing project and programme design and clarification of the conditions for granting contributions from the European Programme for Reconstruction and Development (EPRD) to regional programmes.
(3) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests (3), it is possible to provide funding to the Republic of South Africa through direct budget support. Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 could, however, be interpreted as excluding untargeted budget support. In addition, Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (4) contains in Title IV of Part Two specific provisions for ‘External Actions’. It is, therefore, appropriate to bring Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 into line with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and with Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (5).
(4) In view of the implementation of the EPRD, and in particular of the 2000 to 2002 Multiannual Indicative Programme, Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 should be adjusted, in particular in relation to the adoption of sector-wide programmes, funding through budget support and the joint funding of projects and programmes in the field of regional cooperation and integration.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 entered into force in 2000 and expires on 31 December 2006. However, Article 6(1) requires triennial indicative programming to be carried out. In order for programmes to correspond to the period of validity of the Regulation, provision should also be made for four-year indicative programmes.
(6) The Partnership Agreement between the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States, of the one part, and the European Community and its Member States, of the other part (6), to which South Africa is a signatory, was signed in Cotonou on 23 June 2000. Protocol 3 of that Agreement defines South Africa's qualified status under the Agreement.
(7) Council Decision 1999/753/EC (7) approved the provisional application of the Agreement on Trade, Development and Cooperation between the European Community and its Member States and the Republic of South Africa. Annex X to that Agreement stipulates that the Community will provide assistance for the restructuring of the South African wine and spirits sector and for the marketing and distribution of South African wines and spirits. The two corresponding Agreements on trade in wine and spirits have been approved by Council Decision 2002/51/EC (8) and by Council Decision 2002/52/EC (9) respectively. It is, therefore, necessary to include an additional amount in the financial reference amount provided for by Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000.
(8) In practice, the European Development Fund Committee has been acting in the context of Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 as the ‘South Africa Committee’. It is appropriate formally to establish that Committee.
(9) Article 8(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1726/2000 requests that the Commission consult the Committee on financing decisions it intends to take concerning projects and programmes of a value of over EUR 5 million. For the sake of sound financial management and rationalisation of procedures, it is appropriate to raise this ceiling to EUR 8 million.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Protocol 20 thereof,
Having received the assent of the Council,
Whereas Protocol 20, which covers the restructuring of the Portuguese iron and steel industry and the Joint Declaration on the Portuguese iron and steel industry, provide that deliveries of ECSC steel products of Portuguese origin onto the Community market will be the subject of quantitative limits in 1986;
Whereas, at the date of accession, there was no agreement between the Commission and the Portuguese Government on the level of these aforementioned deliveries;
Whereas, pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 5 (a) of Protocol 20, it falls upon the Commission, with the assent of the Council, to establish the level of these deliveries;
Whereas, by the terms of the first subparagraph of paragraph 3 (a) of the said Joint Declaration the level of the deliveries must be compatible with the forecasts used to calculate the evolution of the Community market;
Whereas no significant changes are forecast for the Community market for 1986 in comparison with 1985, and in particular several important aspects of the internal anti-crisis measures will remain;
Whereas, therefore, the Portuguese deliveries to the rest of the Community, excluding Spain, should not exceed in 1986 the level of 90 000 tonnes, a quantity based on the traditional deliveries of Portugal to the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985, taking into account the recent trend,","{'title': '86/185/ECSC: Commission Decision of 2 April 1986 establishing the delivery levels of ECSC steel products of Portuguese origin onto the rest of the common market, excluding Spain (Only the Portuguese text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDeliveries of ECSC steel products of Portuguese origin onto the rest of the Community market, excluding Spain, may not exceed 90 000 tonnes.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Republic of Portugal.\n\nDone at Brussels, 2 April 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nKarl-Heinz NARJES\n\nVice-President'}]}"

","COUNCIL DECISION of 29 October 1993 on the adoption of a programme of Community action on the subject of the vocational training of indirect taxation officials (Matthaeus-Tax)
(93/588/EEC)THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas in a single market without internal frontiers, indirect taxation officials will play an essential part in ensuring the proper operation of the internal market;
Whereas it must be ensured that the abolition of controls at internal borders does not give rise to distortions in competition, deflection of trade or increased risk of fraud and tax evasion; whereas it is consequently necessary to stimulate intensive  and ongoing cooperation at all levels in the indirect taxation administrations to ensure that they work together to complete the internal market;
Whereas this will be achieved through optimizing the use of human resources in Member States and therefore through suitable vocational training;
Whereas the measures taken in this sphere by each of the national administrations are not in themselves sufficient to achieve the objective being pursued; whereas it is consequently essential to reinforce national efforts through joint action to  increase the awareness of indirect taxation officials of the increasing Community dimension of their tasks and of the need to cooperate more closely together;
Whereas only a better mutual knowledge of the organization, methods and procedures applied in the different Member States can ensure the climate of mutual confidence necessary for a proper functioning of the internal market;
Whereas the experience acquired by the Community from the organization of the Matthaeus programme, intended for the customs officials of the Member States, showed the benefit of training activities, supplementing those organized at the national level,  in developing a Community spirit of the officials working in the internal market; whereas this experience must, mutatis mutandis, be spread to the indirect taxation area;
Whereas, in these conditions, the implementation of a training programme at a Community level for indirect taxation officials (Matthaeus-Tax) constitutes one of the most appropriate ways to achieve this result;
Whereas the Commission adopted a pilot project for 1991 and 1992 based on the exchange of indirect taxation officials between national administrations and training seminars; whereas the aim of this pilot project was to collect useful information to  allow the implementation of a more ambitious training programme extending over several years and supplemented by other training measures;
Whereas the experience acquired during the pilot project indicated that there was an advantage in exchange officials having an involvement in the day-to-day activities of the host service; whereas this requirement will be met most effectively if the  exchange officials have sufficient knowledge of the language of the host country; whereas, for this purpose, it is essential that the national administrations organize language courses for their officials so they can participate more effectively in the  programme; whereas these courses must be of an ongoing nature and must cover, as far as possible, all the official languages of the Community;
Whereas the legal status of exchange officials will be the same as that of national officials where, in performing their duties, their civil liability is put at issue by a third part and they will be informed about the civil liability rules applicable  to them in the host country;
Whereas exchange officials will be bound by the same rules of professional secrecy as national officials, given that exchange officials will take part in the day-to-day work of the host administration;
Whereas the number of officials undergoing an exchange should, as far as possible, amount to some 100 each year and be increased to the extent that budgetary, training and admission capacities permit;
Whereas training measures supplementary to the exchange of officials between national administrations are essential to the achievement of the objective sought; whereas these measures may involve training seminars and the establishment of common training  programmes to be taught in Member States' schools;
Whereas seminars form an ideal forum for the exchange of ideas between indirect taxation officials in the Community; whereas in these seminars, suggestions may emerge which could improve the legal instruments in force and facilitate cooperation between  the administrations concerned;
Whereas the said seminars should concern those indirect taxation officials who belong, as necessary, to all categories and especially trainers in national administrations' schools, officials responsible for implementing indirect taxation law, especially  where it relates to the control of transactions involving other Member States, and officials responsible for combating all types of fiscal fraud;
Whereas the setting up of common training programmes, in so far as necessary, constitutes a suitable means of making comparable training available to officials throughout the Community; whereas these programmes should include the teaching of Community  law as well as the study of Community institutions and their foundations, since indirect taxation officials will increasingly have to integrate these Community aspects;
Whereas the implementation of these common programmes can be accomplished only if Member States provide the necessary facilities; whereas consideration should also be given to creating a joint training centre for indirect taxation officials which should  be located at the Joint Training Centre for customs officials of the Community referred to in Decision 91/341/EEC (4);
Whereas, for the implementation of the Matthaeus-Tax programme, the sharing of expenses under the programme between the Community and the Member States should be determined; whereas, consequently, expenses could be shared by assigning those relating to  the language training of their officials to Member States and the travel and subsistence expenses of officials participating in the programme in another Member State as well as the costs relating to the organization of the seminars to the Community;
Whereas there are reasons to anticipate a programme lasting for four years;
Whereas it is necessary to ensure the uniform application of this Decision and, for that purpose, to provide for a Community procedure for the enactment of implementing rules; whereas a committee should be set up to provide a forum for close and  effective cooperation between Member States and the Commission in this field,","{'title': '93/588/EEC: Council Decision of 29 October 1993 on the adoption of a programme of Community action on the subject of the vocational training of indirect taxation officials (Matthaeus-Tax)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nA Community action programme is hereby established for the vocational training of indirect taxation officials of national administrations (Matthaeus-Tax).'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nFor the purposes of this Decision:\n\n(a) 'indirect taxation' shall mean only those indirect taxes which are the subject of Community legislation;\n\n(b) 'exchange official' shall mean an official of a Member State required to visit another Member State within the context of this Decision;\n\n(c) 'host service' shall mean the taxation service in which the exchange official is required to perform his duties;\n\n(d) 'donor service' shall mean the taxation service in which the exchange official normally performs his duties.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe objectives of the programme shall be:\n\n(a) to prepare indirect taxation officials of Member States for the implications arising out of the creation of the internal market and the development of administrative cooperation, and thus ensure a better application of Community law;\n\n(b) to make national officials aware of the Community dimension of their work and to build mutual confidence between the indirect taxation administrations of Member States;\n\n(c) to provide supplementary, adapted vocational training to indirect taxation officials;\n\n(d) to utilize to the maximum advantage the knowledge of the indirect taxation services in the Community through greater mobility of staff and thus improve the management and the effectiveness of the internal market;\n\n(e) to stimulate intensive and continuous cooperation at all levels of the relevant administrations with a view to them working together within the context of the internal market.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe programme shall consist of the following training measures:\n\n(a) exchanges of indirect taxation officials between national administrations, in accordance with Article 5;\n\n(b) training seminars for officials, particularly trainers in training schools, officials responsible for administrative cooperation as well as officials responsible for indirect taxation controls and the fight against fraud and tax evasion;\n\n(c) the coordinated implementation of vocational training programmes in the training schools of Member States;\n\n(d) the organization in Member States of language training courses for officials likely to participate in exchanges, in accordance with Article 6.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': ""Article 5\n\n1.

Whereas action should be taken to open for 1997 and subsequent years the annual tariff quotas in  question for sweet potatoes and manioc starch and to set appropriate administrative rules; whereas  the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 3015/95 as amended following Decision 96/317/EC  should be taken over;
Whereas to ensure that the quotas are well managed and in particular that the quantities set for  each year are not exceeded specific rules on the lodging of applications and issuing of licences  must be adopted; whereas these either supplement or waive the provisions of Commission Regulation  (EEC) No 3719/88  (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2350/96  (6);
Whereas it is necessary to differentiate sweet potatoes for human consumption and those for other  uses; whereas the presentation and packaging of sweet potatoes of CN code 0714  20  10 for human  consumption should be specified and products not meeting that presentation and packaging  specification should be held to fall within CN code 0714  20  90;
Whereas the management and surveillance rules contained in Regulation (EC) No 3015/95 for imports  between 1 January and 31 December 1996 should be retained, notably the requirement that an export  document issued by the Chinese authorities or under their responsibility be presented for goods  originating in China;
Whereas for manioc starch account must be taken of the Community's new commitment by Decision  96/317/EC to open an additional autonomous annual quota of 10  500 tonnes of which 10  000 tonnes  is reserved for the Kingdom of Thailand; whereas under the terms agreed with Thailand the end-use  requirements previously imposed on manioc starch quotas are waived; whereas it should be required  that manioc starch imported from Thailand against its reserved quantity be accompanied by an export  certificate issued by the competent Thai authority;

Having regard to the previous Decision 95/252/EC (2),
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce or extend special measures for derogation from that Directive in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas, by letter registered at the Commission on 6 October 1997, the United Kingdom requested authorisation to extend application of the derogation previously granted to it by Decision 95/252/EC;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 23 October 1997 of the United Kingdom's request;
Whereas the United Kingdom was authorised by Decision 95/252/EC to apply until 31 December 1997 a measure derogating from Articles 6 and 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC;

Whereas the objective of this restriction of the right to deduct is to tax the private use of cars hired or leased by taxable persons at a flat rate;
Whereas the measure, by reducing the administrative burden on traders, who are not required to keep records of private mileage, constitutes a simplification of the procedure for charging tax within the meaning of Article 27 of Directive 77/388/EEC;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the French Government has submitted to the Commission on 28 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Pays de la Loire; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas  expenditure under this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the French authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;

A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 10 September 1997, the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious dumping by imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China.
(2) The complaint was lodged by the European Chemical Industry Council (Cefic), on behalf of Degussa AG, the sole producer of thiourea dioxide in the Community.
(3) The complaint contained evidence of dumping by the imports concerned and of material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding.
(4) The Commission, after consultation, accordingly announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide currently classifiable within CN code ex 2930 90 70 originating in the People's Republic of China.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producer. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
B. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) By a letter of 6 April 1998 to the Commission, Cefic formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China citing changed circumstances as regards the Community industry having occurred after the lodging of the complaint. In particular, the complainant submitted that the situation of the sole Community producer had changed in the course of the investigation, mitigating the effect of the allegedly dumped imports.
(7) In accordance with Article 9(1) of the Council Regulation, (EC) No 384/96 when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The Commission considered that the present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceeding.
(8) Interested parties were informed of the Commission's intention to terminate the proceeding and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Community interest.
(9) Therefore the Commission has concluded that the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China should be terminated without the imposition of measures,","{'title': ""98/462/EC: Commission Decision of 17 July 1998 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of thiourea dioxide originating in the People's Republic of China (notified under document number C(1998) 2081)""}"

For the sake of simplification it is necessary to convert that amount into head for live bovines and into tonnes for other products.
(2) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 lays down a period of validity of 75 days for export licences with advance fixing of the refund for pure-bred breeding animals falling within CN code 0102 10 and a period of four months plus the current month for licences issued under the procedure referred to in Article 44 of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88. Experience has shown that those periods are too brief and that they should be extended to five months plus the current month. At the same time, there should accordingly be a derogation increasing from 21 to 90 days the time limit referred to in Article 44(5) of Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 within which the exporter must inform the agency issuing the licence of the result of a tendering procedure opened in a third country.

Whereas, in the near future, satellites for direct television broadcasting will be brought into service by several European countries and subsequently new television sets corresponding to public needs will be introduced by the manufacturers;
Whereas the use of common technical specifications for direct satellite broadcasting of television programmes and possibly for their redistribution by cable is necessary in order to attain the objectives set out hereafter;
Whereas the implementation of common technical specifications simplifies the broadcasting of television programmes in all countries of the Community and makes a significant contribution to European unification and to the development of a true European identity;
Whereas the technical capability to transmit simultaneously on several sound channels opens the way to truly pan-European multilingual television programmes;
Whereas the implementation of common technical specifications leads to the creation of a large unified market, on which products will be freely exchanged without any technical barriers, which will be of great economic benefit for the European consumer electronics industry as regards its competitiveness;
Whereas it is indispensable that a guarantee be given to manufacturers and operators in respect of their investments and supplies, by the application of common technical standards at Community level;
Whereas the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and the European manufacturers of the relevant branch represented by their associations have perfected and published technical specifications forming part of the MAC/packet family for the direct television breoadcasting and the redistribution of programmes by cable; whereas these specifications have been confirmed at international level by the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR);
Whereas the MAC/packet family now includes:
- for direct satellite broadcasting: the system C-MAC/packet and the system D2-MAC/packet with frequency modulation,
- for cable distribution: the system D-MAC/packet and the system D2-MAC/packet;
Whereas these systems are very largely compatible with each other on the operational level;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and  the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy  (3), as last  amended by Regulation (EC) No 150/95 of 30 January 1995  (4), and in particular Articles 12 and 13  (1) thereof,
Whereas the compensation referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 is granted, under  certain conditions, to Community tuna producers' organizations in respect of quantities of tuna  delivered to the canning industry during the calendar quarter for which prices were recorded, where  both the average quarterly price recorded on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price  plus any applicable countervailing charge are lower than 93  % of the Community producer price for  the product in question;
Whereas examination of the situation of the Community market has shown that for two species of the  product in question, for the period 1 April to 30 June 1994, both the average quarterly market  price and the free-at-frontier price referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 were  lower than 93  % of the Community producer price in force as laid down in Commission Regulation  (EC) No 281/94 of 8 February 1994 adjusting the prices fixed in ecus in the fishery products sector  for the 1994 fishing year as a result of the monetary realignments  (5);
Whereas the quantities eligible for compensation, within the meaning of Article 18 (2) of  Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92, may not under any circumstances exceed, for the quarter concerned, the  limits laid down in paragraph 4 of that Article;
Whereas during the quarter concerned the quantities sold and delivered to the canning industry  established in Community customs territory were higher overall than 62,8  % of the quantities of  tuna used by the industry during the same quarter and, for yellowfin tuna weighing more than 10 kg,  more than 110  % of those sold and delivered during the same quarter of the fishing years 1984 to  1986; whereas since these quantities exceed the limit set by the first indent of Article 18 (4) of  Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for bigeye tuna and by the third indent of that Article for yellowfin  tuna weighing over 10 kg, the total quantities of those products eligible for compensation should  therefore be limited and allocated between the producers' organizations concerned in proportion to  their respective outputs during the same quarter of the 1984 to 1986 fishing years;
Whereas the granting of compensation for the product in question should therefore be decided for  the period 1  April to 30 June 1994;
Whereas Article 9 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2381/89  (6) stipulates that the agricultural  conversion rate applicable to the compensatory allowance for tuna for canning shall be that in  force on the day the product is sold; whereas the agricultural conversion rate for the period 1  October to 31 December 1993 is, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1209/93  (7), affected  by a correcting factor of 1,207509; whereas this must be taken into account in the compensation  rate set;

Whereas the first period of application of the measures laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1442/88  shows that the existing financing mechanism does not enable premiums to be paid quickly to  wine-growers since it is difficult to provide the paying agencies in the Member States with the  necessary sums, which leads to considerable delays; whereas, under these circumstances, abandonment  premiums lose their attraction to a large extent for producers and the aim of restoring balance to  the market by this means is jeopardized, particularly as the most recent information regarding the  consumption of wine is hardly encouraging; whereas everything should be done to ensure that the  anticipated results are realized in order to avoid massive intervention to absorb the surplus and  from 1 January 1990 premiums for

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 of 28 October 1996 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1933/2001(2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 establishes a Community processing threshold for certain citrus fruits, distributed among the Member States in accordance with Annex II thereto. Article 5(2) provides that when this threshold is overrun the amounts of aid indicated in Annex I thereto are to be reduced in each Member State in which the threshold has been overrun. The overrun of the processing threshold is assessed on the basis of the average quantities processed under the aid scheme during the three marketing years preceding the marketing year for which the aid is to be fixed, or during an equivalent period.
(2) The Member States have communicated the quantities of oranges processed under the aid scheme in accordance with Article 23(1)(c) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1092/2001 of 30 May 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 introducing a Community aid scheme for producers of certain citrus fruits(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 350/2002(4). Based on this information, it has been established that the Community processing threshold has been overrun by 101966 tonnes. Within that overrun, Italy has overrun its threshold. The amounts of aid for oranges indicated in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for the 2003/04 marketing year must therefore be reduced by 14,93 % in Italy.
(3) The Member States have communicated the quantities of grapefruit and pomelos processed under the aid scheme in accordance with Article 23(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1092/2001. Based on this information, it has been established that the Community processing threshold has been overrun by 2286 tonnes. Within that overrun, Greece, Spain, France and Italy have overrun their thresholds. The amounts of aid for grapefruit and pomelos indicated in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2202/96 for the 2003/04 marketing year must therefore be reduced by 19,83 % in Greece, 54,14 % in Spain, 26,74 % in France and 33,29 % in Italy.

Whereas the Council has adopted Regulation (EEC) No 1059/88 of 28 March 1988 laying down the arrangements applicable to Greece's trade with Turkey (3); whereas the Council has also adopted Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the  arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey on the other (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 4162/87 (5);
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rates laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports of the product in question into all the Member States until the quota is  exhausted; whereas it is appropriate to take the necessary measures to ensure efficient Community administration of this tariff quota while offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota volume the necessary quantities corresponding  to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;

There should therefore also be a specific certificate of authenticity for goods originating in the customs territory Kosovo.\n\n((6)) The quotas concerned should be managed through the use of import licences. To this end, Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80(8)and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products(9)should be applicable subject to this Regulation.\n\n((7)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences(10)lays down in particular detailed provisions on applications for import licences, the status of applicants, the issue of licences and the notifications by the Member States to the Commission. That Regulation limits the period of validity of licences to the last day of the import tariff quota period. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 should apply to import licences issued pursuant to this Regulation, without prejudice to additional conditions or derogations laid down in this Regulation.\n\n((8)) In order to ensure proper management of imports of the products concerned, import licences should be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The following tariff quotas are hereby opened for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2008:\n(a)\n9\xa0400 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Croatia;\n(b)\n1\xa0500 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n(c)\n1\xa0650 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, expressed in carcass weight, originating in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia;\n(d)\n9\xa0175 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, expressed in carcass weight, originating in the customs territories of Serbia and Kosovo;\n(e)\n800 tonnes of ‘baby beef’, expressed in carcass weight, originating in Montenegro.\nThe quotas referred to in the first subparagraph shall bear the order Nos 09.4503, 09.4504, 09.4505, 09.4198 and 09.4199 respectively.\nFor the purposes of attributing those quotas, 100 kilograms live weight shall be equivalent to 50 kilograms carcass weight.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The customs duty applicable under the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 shall be 20\xa0% of the\nad valorem\nduty and 20\xa0% of the specific duty as laid down in the Common Customs Tariff.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Importation under the quotas referred to in paragraph 1 shall be reserved for certain live animals and certain meat falling within the following CN codes, referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded with Croatia, in Annex III to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement concluded with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and in Annex II to the Interim Agreement with Montenegro:\n—\nex\xa00102\xa090\xa051, ex\xa00102\xa090\xa059, ex\xa00102\xa090\xa071 and ex\xa00102\xa090\xa079,\n—\nex\xa00201\xa010\xa000 and ex\xa00201\xa020\xa020,\n—\nex\xa00201\xa020\xa030,\n—\nex\xa00201\xa020\xa050.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nRegulation (EC) No 1445/95, Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 and Chapter III of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 shall apply, save as otherwise provided for in this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Section 8 of licence applications and licences shall show the country or customs territory of origin and the mention ‘yes’ shall be marked by a cross.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom, of 13 February 1989 on the harmonisation of the compilation of gross national product at market prices (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Whereas Commission Decision 94/168/EC, Euratom, of 22 February 1994 on measures to be taken for the implementation of Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom on the harmonization of the compilation of gross national product at market prices (2), relates in particular to tax evasion but does not explicitly describe how VAT evasion should be treated; whereas it is therefore appropriate to describe how such evasion should be treated;
Whereas, in order to ensure the exhaustiveness of their GDP and GNP estimates in accordance with Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom, the Member States need to adjust those estimates so as to take VAT evasion into account;
Whereas such adjustment relates to that component of the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts which is attributable to evasion not involving the connivance of the buyer ('without complicity`);

The value of theoretical VAT receipts;\n\n2. The discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the period.\n\nCalculation of theoretical VAT receipts\n\nThe theoretical VAT receipts are the amounts of VAT which would be collected if all units subject to VAT were to pay it as required by law.\n\nIn order to calculate theoretical VAT receipts, the first step is to bring the VAT base into line with current legislation: in other words, to identify all the transactions which are subject to non-deductible VAT. Final household consumption is treated as wholly subject to non-deductible VAT, whereas other categories of uses have to be broken down in order to determine a rate of non-deductibility. This calculation is made using the most highly disaggregated national accounts data available. The VAT base is calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\n\nThe second step is to apply the appropriate rate of VAT to each transaction constituting the VAT base as defined in the previous paragraph. The VAT rates applied must be those in force during the year for which the VAT base has been calculated. Theoretical VAT receipts are calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules governing VAT.\n\nCalculation of the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and VAT receipts actually collected during the reference period\n\nThe discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts (calculated in the light of all current legislation and rules) and actual VAT receipts comprises four components:\n\n1. Time differences between treasury data and national accounts data;\n\n2. Ad hoc cancellations by the tax authorities of certain VAT claims in cases of insolvency;\n\n3. Evasion involving the buyers' connivance (with complicity) (cases where the buyer does not pay VAT to the seller);\n\n4. Evasion not involving the buyers' connivance (without complicity) (cases where the buyer pays VAT to the seller, but the latter fails to remit it to the tax authorities).\n\nAs a result, the value of evasion 'without complicity` is arrived at by deducting evasion 'with complicity` and insolvency-related cancellations from the discrepancies between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts, taking into account time differences between the transaction giving rise to the VAT and the collection of VAT receipts by the tax authorities.\n\nEvasion 'without complicity` = Theoretical VAT receipts less actual VAT receipts less time differences less insolvencies less missing receipts (evasion 'with complicity`)\n\nActual VAT receipts are the amounts actually collected by the tax authorities during the period to which the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts relates.\n\nAdjustments for time differences are intended to correct receipts so as to allow for the fact that some payments of VAT made in the current year (n) relate to the previous year (n-1) and that some VAT payable in respect of year n is not actually collected until the following year (n+1).\n\nThere may be instances where current legislation entitles the tax authorities to make ad hoc cancellations of VAT claims in cases of insolvency. In such cases, the value of the cancellations must be deducted from the difference between theoretical VAT receipts and actual VAT receipts (unless it has already been taken into account in the calculation of theoretical VAT receipts).\n\nIn order to calculate the value of evasion 'with complicity`, only those activities should be taken into account in respect of which an adjustment for undeclared work (non-recording in statistical files of economically active units) has been made.\n\nBy using this method, applying the adjustments for undeclared work previously made to the output of branches of economic activity and multiplying the corresponding amounts for additional sales (undeclared sales) by the appropriate rates of VAT, it is possible to estimate the value of 'missing` VAT receipts which the tax authorities have been denied because of VAT evasion 'with complicity`.\n\nBy way of example: if, following an adjustment for undeclared work, the estimate of the household consumption of a given product, excluding VAT, is increased by 15 %, and if the rate of VAT applying to purchases of that product is 18,6 %, the amount owing to the tax authorities can be calculated as follows:\n\nMissing VAT receipts due to evasion 'with complicity` = value of sales of the product before adjustment × 15 % × 18,6 %.""}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 718/2001(2), and in particular Article 35(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2190/96(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 298/2000(4), lays down detailed rules on export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant quantities of the products listed in that Article to be exported, the difference between the international market prices for those products and their prices in the Community may be covered by export refunds.
(3) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or the outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the costs referred to in Article 35(4)(b) of that Regulation and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(4) Pursuant to Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, refunds are to be set with due regard to the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint. International trade prices are to be established in the light of the prices referred to in the second subparagraph of that paragraph.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Shelled almonds, hazelnuts and walnuts in shell can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) Compared with other fruit and vegetables, nuts are relatively easy to store. Export refunds can accordingly be fixed for longer periods with a view to rational management of the arrangements.
(9) The application of the abovementioned rules to the present and forecast market situation, and in particular to fruit and vegetable prices in the Community and international trade, gives the refund rates set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) Pursuant to Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, the resources available should be used as efficiently as possible while avoiding discrimination between traders. Therefore, care should be taken not to disturb the trade flows previously induced by the refund arrangements. For those reasons and because of the seasonal nature of exports of fruit and vegetables, quotas should be fixed for each product.
(11) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2849/2000(6), establishes an agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds.
(12) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(7) lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(13) Owing to the market situation, in order to make the most efficient use of the resources available and given the structure of Community exports, the most appropriate method should be selected for export refunds on certain products and certain destinations and consequently refunds under the A 1 and A 2 licence arrangements referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 2190/96 should not be fixed simultaneously for the export period in question.
(14) The quantities laid down for the various products should be distributed in accordance with the different systems for the grant of the refund, taking account in particular of their perishability.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1184/2001 of 15 June 2001 fixing export refunds on nuts', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (1), last amended by Directive 2003/89/EC (2), and in particular Articles 19 and 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the procedure provided for in the second paragraph of Article 19, Directive 2000/13/EC, the Irish authorities notified the Commission on 25 June 2008 of a draft Health Regulations concerning the mandatory labelling of the country of origin of poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat.
(2) The draft Regulations require all poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat, and foods containing at least 70 % by weight of these meats to be labelled to indicate their country of origin in clear legible type in Irish and/or English language. ‘Origin’ is defined as the country in which the animal was reared for most of its life and, if different, the country where it was slaughtered.
(3) Directive 2000/13/EC harmonises the rules governing the labelling of foodstuffs by making provision for, on the one hand, harmonisation of certain national provisions and, secondly, arrangements for non-harmonised national provisions. The scope of harmonisation is defined in Article 3(1), which lists all the particulars that are compulsory on the labelling of foodstuffs ‘in accordance with Articles 4 to 17 and subject to the exceptions contained therein’. Furthermore, Article 4(2) provides that other particulars in addition to those listed in Article 3(1) may be required, in the case of specified foodstuffs, by Community provisions or, in their absence, by national provisions.
(4) Article 18(2) of Directive 2000/13/EC allows the adoption of non-harmonised national provisions if they are justified on one of the grounds listed therein, including, inter alia, the prevention of fraud and the protection of public health, and provided they are not of such a nature as to impede application of the definitions and rules laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC; therefore where draft national labelling provisions have been proposed in a Member State, it is necessary to examine their compatibility with the above-mentioned requirements and the provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(1) point 8 of Directive 2000/13/EC the indication of the place of origin or provenance is mandatory ‘where failure to give such particulars might mislead the consumer to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the foodstuff’. This provision, by providing an obligation to indicate the origin or the provenance of a food where other indications on the label of a given product could imply that such product comes from a different origin, provides an appropriate mechanism to counter the risk of consumers being misled.
(6) In the case of poultrymeat, pigmeat and sheepmeat, the grounds presented by the Irish authorities do not allow for the conclusion that Irish consumers might, as a general rule, erroneously think that the products concerned come from a certain place.
(7) Ireland has not provided any evidence that the draft Regulations are necessary to attain one of the objectives of the above-mentioned Article 18 or that the obstacle thus created is proportionate. It mentions only the aim of informing consumers on the origin of the products concerned. This ground alone is not sufficient to justify the draft Regulations.
(8) In light of these observations, the Commission has delivered a negative opinion pursuant to Article 19, third paragraph of Directive 2000/13/EC.
(9) The Irish authorities should accordingly be requested not to adopt the draft Regulations in question.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromochloromethane.
(2) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.
(3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.
(4) Decision XIX/13 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production in the European Community of 200 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 2008 for the manufacturing and use of Metered-Dose Inhalers (MDIs) qualifying for essential uses of CFCs as defined in Decision IV/25.
(5) Decision XIX/18 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, as well as Decisions VII/11, XI/15 and XV/5 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of the controlled substance listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical uses of methyl bromide.
(6) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free MDIs, all Member States have notified (2) the United Nations Environment Programme the active ingredients for which chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of CFC-MDIs for placing on the market of the European Community.
(7) Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).
(8) The Commission has published a Notice (3) on the 18 July 2007 to those companies in the Community of 27 Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2008 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2008.
(9) For the purpose of ensuring that interested companies and operators may continue to benefit in due time from the licensing system, it is appropriate that the present decision shall apply from 1 January 2008.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents (1), and in particular Article 13(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 ensures the free circulation of detergents on the internal market while at the same time providing a high level of protection to the environment and to human health by laying down rules for the ultimate biodegradation of surfactants for detergents, and for the labelling of detergent ingredients.
(2) Some of the methods laid down in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, e.g. the ISO 14593 reference method, are also applicable for testing substances that are poorly-soluble in water, if adequate dispersion of the substance is ensured. More guidance for testing poorly-soluble substances is given in ISO 10634. However, an additional test method should be introduced for use with surfactants that are poorly-soluble in water. The additional test method proposed is ISO standard 10708:1997 ‘Water quality — Evaluation in an aqueous medium of the ultimate aerobic biodegradability of organic compounds’. The Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) concluded that ISO 10708 is of an equivalent standard to the test methods already included in Annex III to that Regulation and was in favour of its use.
(3) To ensure a high level of health protection, information concerning detergent composition needs to be made more easily available to the general public. The address of a website should therefore be provided on the packaging of the detergent from which the list of ingredients mentioned in Section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 can be easily obtained.
(4) There is a requirement to declare allergenic fragrances if they are added in the form of pure substances. However there is no requirement to declare them if they are added as constituents of complex ingredients such as essential oils or perfumes. To ensure better transparency to the consumer, allergenic fragrances in detergents should be declared irrespective of the way they are added to the detergent.
(5) The list of ingredients intended for the general public that is given in section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 requires the use of specialised scientific nomenclature that may hinder rather than help the general public. Moreover, there are some minor inconsistencies between the information made available to the general public compared to that to be made available to medical personnel under section C of the same Annex. The ingredient information for the general public should be made more easily understandable by using the INCI nomenclature already in use for cosmetic ingredients, and sections C and D should be made compatible.
(6) The definition of ‘detergent’ in the Regulation makes it clear that the rules on labelling apply to all detergents whether they contain surfactants or not. However, section D of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 lays down different rules for those industrial and institutional detergents that contain surfactants compared with those that do not. This difference in labelling requirements serves no useful purpose and should be eliminated.
(7) Annexes III and VII to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 should be amended accordingly. In the interest of clarity it is appropriate to replace those Annexes.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(2),
Whereas:
(1) There is a need for comparable statistics on research and development, technological innovation and science and technology in general in order to support Community policies.
(2) Council Decision 94/78/EC, Euratom of 24 January 1994 establishing a multiannual programme for the development of Community statistics on research, development and innovation(3), highlighted the objectives of setting out a Community reference framework for statistics and of establishing a harmonised Community statistical information system in this field.
(3) The final report for the programme period 1994 to 1997 emphasises that the work should be continued, that data should be made available more rapidly, that the regional coverage should be extended and that the comparability of the data must be increased.
(4) In accordance with Council Decision 1999/126/EC of 22 December 1998 on the Community statistical programme 1998 to 2002(4), the statistical information system is to support the management of science and technology policies in the Community and the assessment of R& D and innovation capability of regions for administration of structural funds.
(5) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics(5), those statistics are to be governed by the principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency.
(6) In order to ensure usefulness and comparability of the data and avoid overlap of work, the Community should take into account work carried out in cooperation with or by the OECD and other international organisations concerning science and technology statistics, especially as regards the details of data to be provided by the Member States.
(7) Community policy on science, technology and innovation attaches particular importance to strengthening the scientific and technological basis of European businesses so as to enable them to be more innovative and competitive on the international and regional level, realising the benefits of the information society and promoting the transfer of technology, improving activities in the domain of intellectual property rights and the development of mobility of human resources, and promoting equality between men and women in science.
(8) The principles of cost-effectiveness and relevance should apply to data collection procedures for industry and administrations, taking into account the necessary quality of the data and the burden on the respondents.
(9) It is essential that developments in official statistics on science and technology are coordinated to cater also for the essential needs of national, regional and local administrations, international organisations, economic operators, professional associations and the general public.
(10) Council Decision 1999/173/EC of 25 January 1999 adopting a specific programme for research, technological development and demonstration on improving the human research potential and the socio-economic knowledge base (1998 to 2002)(6) and Decision 1513/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 concerning the sixth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation of the European research area and to innovation (2002 to 2006)(7) should be taken into account to avoid overlap of work.
(11) Council Resolution of 26 June 2001 on science and society and on women in science(8), welcoming the work of the Helsinki Group and inviting Member States and the Commission to pursue efforts to promote women in science at national level should be taken into account, in particular as regards the collection of gender-disaggregated statistics in human resources in science and technology and the development of indicators in order to monitor progress towards equality between men and women in European research.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 806/2003(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 833/2003(4), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission submitted after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under that Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional measures
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 547/90 (2) imposed provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of monosodium glutamate (hereinafter referred to as 'KSG') originating in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea. Taiwan and Thailand, and accepted undertakings from all the exporters which cooperated in the investigation and terminated the investigation concerning those exporters.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional duty on interested party requested a hearing or made written submissions within the time limit with regard to the findings set out in Regulation (EEC) No 547/90. Only one exporter namely Cheil Sugar Co. Ltd, Seoul, whose undertaking had been accepted, informed the Commission that its company name had changed to Cheil Foods & Chemicals Inc., Seoul.
(3) After expiry of the time limit, the company Tesco Chemiehandel GmbH, Duesseldorf, which was listed in recital (3) (c) of Regulation (EEC) No 547/90 amongst 'importers in the Community', claimed that it should have not been mentioned in that Regulation, as it did not import WSG originating in the countries concerned.
C. Dumping
(4) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty and the Commission therefore considers its findings on dumping as set out in Regulation No 547/90 to be definitive.
Consequently, the preliminary determinations on dumping are confirmed by the Council.
D. Injury
(5) As no fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry was received, the Council also confirms the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) 547/90.
E. Community interest
(6) No observations were received from any interested party within the time limit laid down in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 547/90 and the Commission had no reason to change its conclusions set out in recital 23 of the said Regulation.
(7) The Council confirms that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken. In these circumstances, the Community's interest calls for the imposition of definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of monosodium glutamate originating in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand.
F. Amount of definitive duty
(8) In the light of the above determination, the amounts of the definitive anti-dumping duty should be the same as the amounts of the provisional anti-dumping duty.
G. Collection of provisional duty
(9) In view of the size of the dumping margins found and the seriousness of the injury caused to Community producers, it is considered necessary that amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty should be collected in full,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1798/90 of 27 June 1990 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of monosodium glutamate originating in Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Taiwan and Thailand and definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on such imports', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (1) and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/363/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on foodstuffs of animal origin (2) and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables (3) and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) For the existing active substance amitraz a decision was taken not to include it in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC (4) by Commission Decision 2004/141/EC (5). This Decision provides that plant protection products containing this active substance shall no longer be authorised for use in the Community except for a limited number of uses, where at the moment no alternatives are available (essential uses).
(2) Decision 2004/141/EC allowed a phasing out period, and it is appropriate that maximum residue levels (MRLs) premised on the notion that use of the substance concerned is not authorised in the Community, should not apply until the end of the phasing out period applying to that substance.
(3) For amitraz MRLs for residues resulting from veterinary medicinal uses have been set on animal products in the framework of Council Regulation (EC) No 2377/90 (6). It is appropriate to take these into account in this Directive.
(4) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius (7) are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a limited number of Codex MRLs for amitraz. These have been considered in the setting of the MRLs fixed in this Directive. Codex MRLs that will be recommended for withdrawal in the near future were not taken into account. The MRLs based on Codex MRLs having been evaluated in the light of the risks for the consumers, no risk was established.
(5) In order to ensure that the consumer is adequately protected from exposure to residues resulting from unauthorised uses of plant protection products, MRLs should be set for the relevant product/pesticide combinations at the lower limit of analytical determination.
(6) It is therefore necessary to amend several of the pesticide residues arising from use of amitraz in the Annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(7) The relevant annexes to Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '9.7.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 177/35', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2005/46/EC\nof 8 July 2005\namending the Annexes to Council Directives 86/362/EEC, 86/363/EEC and 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for amitraz\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) For the existing active substance amitraz a decision was taken not to include it in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC(4)by Commission Decision 2004/141/EC(5).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98 (2), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 2107/98 (3), the Commission imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Saudi Arabia, and accepted price undertakings offered by the Hungarian producers. By Regulation (EC) No 2649/98 (4), the Commission also accepted a price undertaking offered by a Czech producer.
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping measures, and in accordance with Article 8(6) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as the 'basic Regulation`), the Commission continued its investigation of dumping, injury and Community interest. It was established that, with the exception of Saudi Arabia, definitive anti-dumping measures should be imposed in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping.
The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 603/1999 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of polypropylene binder or baler twine originating in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed (5).
(3) In accordance with the provisions of the undertakings, the minimum prices contained therein have been amended, where appropriate, in line with the definitive findings of the investigation. They are now appropriate to remedy the injurious effect of dumping.
Subsequent to the Commission's acceptance of these undertakings, another Czech and a Polish producer also offered undertakings which were judged acceptable.
It is therefore appropriate to accept in this Decision all the undertakings offered.

amending Annexes I and II to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed as regards dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed (1), and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/32/EC provides that the putting into circulation and the use of products intended for animal feed that contain levels of undesirable substances exceeding the maximum levels laid down in Annex I thereto is prohibited.
(2) The term ‘dioxins’ as referred to in this Directive covers a group of 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin congeners (PCDD) and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners, of which 17 are of toxicological concern. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 different congeners which can be divided into two groups according to their toxicological properties: 12 congeners exhibit similar toxicological properties to dioxins and are therefore often termed ‘dioxin-like PCBs’. The other PCBs do not exhibit dioxin-like toxicity but they have a different toxicological profile.
(3) Each congener of dioxins or dioxin-like PCBs exhibits a different level of toxicity. In order to be able to sum up the toxicity of these different congeners, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been introduced to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. This means that the analytical results relating to all 17 individual dioxin congeners and to the 12 dioxin-like PCB congeners are expressed in terms of a quantifiable unit, namely the ‘TCDD toxic equivalent concentration’ (TEQ).
(4) On 30 May 2001 the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) adopted an opinion on the Risk Assessment of Dioxins and Dioxin-like PCBs in Food, updating its opinion of 22 November 2000 on this subject on the basis of new scientific information that had become available since the latter’s adoption (2). The SCF fixed a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Exposure estimates indicate that a considerable proportion of the Community population have a dietary intake in excess of the TWI. Certain population groups in some countries could be at higher risk owing to particular dietary habits.
(5) More than 90 % of human dioxin and dioxin-like PCB exposure derives from foodstuffs. Foodstuffs of animal origin normally contribute approximately 80 % of overall exposure. The dioxin and dioxin-like PCB burden in animals stems mainly from feedingstuffs. Therefore feedingstuffs, and in some cases soil, are of concern as potential sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
(6) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) has been asked to advise on the sources of contamination of feedingstuffs with dioxins and PCBs, including dioxin-like PCBs, the exposure of food-producing animals to dioxins and PCBs, the carry-over of these compounds to food products of animal origin, and any impact on animal health of dioxins and PCBs present in feedingstuffs. The SCAN adopted an opinion on 6 November 2000. It identified fish meal and fish oil as the most heavily contaminated feed materials. Animal fat was identified as the next most seriously contaminated material. All other feed materials of animal and plant origin had relatively low levels of dioxin contamination. Roughages presented a wide range of dioxin contamination depending on location, degree of contamination with soil and exposure to sources of aerial pollution. The SCAN recommended, inter alia, that emphasis should be placed on reducing the impact of the most contaminated feed materials on overall diet contamination.
(7) Although, from a toxicological point of view, the maximum level should apply to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, maximum levels were set for dioxins only and not for dioxin-like PCBs, given the very limited data available at that time on the prevalence of dioxin-like PCBs. However, in the meantime more data on the presence of dioxin-like PCBs have become available.
(8) According to Directive 2002/32/EC, the Commission should review the provisions as regards dioxins by the end of 2004 for the first time, in the light of new data on the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, in particular with a view to the inclusion of dioxin-like PCBs in the levels to be set.
(9) All operators in the food and feed chain must continue to make all possible efforts to do all that is necessary to limit the presence of dioxins and PCBs present in feed and food. Directive 2002/32/EC accordingly provides that the maximum levels applicable should be further reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest with the aim of significantly reducing the maximum levels. Given the time necessary to obtain sufficient monitoring data to determine such significantly lower levels, that time-limit should be extended.
(10) It is proposed to set maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs expressed in World Health Organisation (WHO) toxic equivalents, using the WHO-TEFs as this is the most appropriate approach from a toxicological point of view. In order to ensure a smooth switchover, for a transitional period the existing levels for dioxins should continue to apply, in addition to the newly set levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The separate maximum level for dioxins (PCDD/F) remains applicable for a temporary period. The products intended for animal feed mentioned in point 27a have to comply during that period with the maximum levels for dioxins and with the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 to dispensing with the separate maximum level for dioxins.
(11) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach throughout the Community. Commission Directive 2002/70/EC of 26 July 2002 establishing requirements for the determination of levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feedingstuffs (3) provides that a product intended for animal feeding shall be considered as non-compliant with the established maximum level if the analytical result confirmed by duplicate analysis and calculated as the mean of at least two separate determinations exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty. There are different possibilities to estimate the expanded uncertainty (4).
(12) The scope of Directive 2002/32/EC covers the possibility of establishing maximum levels of undesirable substances in feed additives. Since high levels of dioxins have been found in trace elements, a maximum level should be established for dioxins and the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for all additives belonging to the functional group of compounds of trace elements and the maximum levels should be extended to all additives belonging to the functional group of binders and anti-caking agents and to premixtures.
(13) In order to encourage a proactive approach to reducing the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs present in food and feed, action levels were set by Commission Recommendation 2002/201/EC of 4 March 2002 on the reduction of the presence of dioxins, furans and PCBs in feedingstuffs and foodstuffs (5). Those action levels are a tool for competent authorities and operators to highlight those cases where it is appropriate to identify a source of contamination and to take measures to reduce or eliminate it. Since the sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are different, separate action levels should be determined for dioxins on the one hand and for dioxin-like PCBs on the other hand.
(14) Directive 2002/32/EC provides for the possibility of setting action levels. The action levels should therefore be transferred from Recommendation 2002/201/EC to Annex II to Directive 2002/32/EC.
(15) The reduction of human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs through food consumption is important and necessary to ensure consumer protection. As food contamination is directly related to feed contamination, an integrated approach must be adopted to reduce dioxin and dioxin-like PCB incidence throughout the food chain, i.e. from products intended for animal feed through food-producing animals to humans. A proactive approach is followed to actively reduce the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feed and food and consequently the maximum levels applicable should be reviewed within a defined period of time with the objective to set lower levels. Therefore consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 at the latest to significantly reducing the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
(16) Operators need to make efforts to step up their decontamination capacity to remove effectively dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish oil. Further efforts have to done by the operators to investigate the different possibilities to remove dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish meal and fish protein-hydrolysates. Once the decontamination technology is also available for fish meal and fish protein hydrolysates, operators will have to do efforts to provide for sufficient decontamination capacity. The significant lower maximum level for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, to which consideration shall be given by 31 December 2008, shall be for fish oil, fish meal and fish protein hydrolysates based on the technical possibilities of the most effective, economically viable, decontamination procedure. As regards fish feed, this significant lower level shall be determined based on the technical possibilities of the most effective, economically viable, decontamination procedure for fish oil and fish meal.
(17) The extraction procedure used for the analysis of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs has a large influence on the analytical result in particular on products intended for animal feed of mineral origin and it is therefore appropriate to determine before the date of application the extraction procedure to be used for the analysis of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.
(18) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(19) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '4.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 32/44', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/13/EC\nof 3 February 2006\namending Annexes I and II to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feed as regards dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2002/32/EC provides that the putting into circulation and the use of products intended for animal feed that contain levels of undesirable substances exceeding the maximum levels laid down in Annex I thereto is prohibited.\n\n((2)) The term ‘dioxins’ as referred to in this Directive covers a group of 75 polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin congeners (PCDD) and 135 polychlorinated dibenzofuran (PCDF) congeners, of which 17 are of toxicological concern. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of 209 different congeners which can be divided into two groups according to their toxicological properties: 12 congeners exhibit similar toxicological properties to dioxins and are therefore often termed ‘dioxin-like PCBs’. The other PCBs do not exhibit dioxin-like toxicity but they have a different toxicological profile.\n\n((3)) Each congener of dioxins or dioxin-like PCBs exhibits a different level of toxicity. In order to be able to sum up the toxicity of these different congeners, the concept of toxic equivalency factors (TEFs) has been introduced to facilitate risk assessment and regulatory control. This means that the analytical results relating to all 17 individual dioxin congeners and to the 12 dioxin-like PCB congeners are expressed in terms of a quantifiable unit, namely the ‘TCDD toxic equivalent concentration’ (TEQ).\n\n((4)) On 30 May 2001 the Scientific Committee for Food (SCF) adopted an opinion on the Risk Assessment of Dioxins and Dioxin-like PCBs in Food, updating its opinion of 22 November 2000 on this subject on the basis of new scientific information that had become available since the latter’s adoption(2). The SCF fixed a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) of 14 pg WHO-TEQ/kg body weight for dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Exposure estimates indicate that a considerable proportion of the Community population have a dietary intake in excess of the TWI. Certain population groups in some countries could be at higher risk owing to particular dietary habits.\n\n((5)) More than 90\xa0% of human dioxin and dioxin-like PCB exposure derives from foodstuffs. Foodstuffs of animal origin normally contribute approximately 80\xa0% of overall exposure. The dioxin and dioxin-like PCB burden in animals stems mainly from feedingstuffs. Therefore feedingstuffs, and in some cases soil, are of concern as potential sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.\n\n((6)) The Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition (SCAN) has been asked to advise on the sources of contamination of feedingstuffs with dioxins and PCBs, including dioxin-like PCBs, the exposure of food-producing animals to dioxins and PCBs, the carry-over of these compounds to food products of animal origin, and any impact on animal health of dioxins and PCBs present in feedingstuffs. The SCAN adopted an opinion on 6 November 2000. It identified fish meal and fish oil as the most heavily contaminated feed materials. Animal fat was identified as the next most seriously contaminated material. All other feed materials of animal and plant origin had relatively low levels of dioxin contamination. Roughages presented a wide range of dioxin contamination depending on location, degree of contamination with soil and exposure to sources of aerial pollution. The SCAN recommended,inter alia, that emphasis should be placed on reducing the impact of the most contaminated feed materials on overall diet contamination.\n\n((7)) Although, from a toxicological point of view, the maximum level should apply to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, maximum levels were set for dioxins only and not for dioxin-like PCBs, given the very limited data available at that time on the prevalence of dioxin-like PCBs. However, in the meantime more data on the presence of dioxin-like PCBs have become available.\n\n((8)) According to Directive 2002/32/EC, the Commission should review the provisions as regards dioxins by the end of 2004 for the first time, in the light of new data on the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, in particular with a view to the inclusion of dioxin-like PCBs in the levels to be set.\n\n((9)) All operators in the food and feed chain must continue to make all possible efforts to do all that is necessary to limit the presence of dioxins and PCBs present in feed and food. Directive 2002/32/EC accordingly provides that the maximum levels applicable should be further reviewed by 31 December 2006 at the latest with the aim of significantly reducing the maximum levels. Given the time necessary to obtain sufficient monitoring data to determine such significantly lower levels, that time-limit should be extended.\n\n((10)) It is proposed to set maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs expressed in World Health Organisation (WHO) toxic equivalents, using the WHO-TEFs as this is the most appropriate approach from a toxicological point of view. In order to ensure a smooth switchover, for a transitional period the existing levels for dioxins should continue to apply, in addition to the newly set levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. The separate maximum level for dioxins (PCDD/F) remains applicable for a temporary period. The products intended for animal feed mentioned in point 27a have to comply during that period with the maximum levels for dioxins and with the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs. Consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 to dispensing with the separate maximum level for dioxins.\n\n((11)) It is of major importance that analytical results are reported and interpreted in a uniform way in order to ensure a harmonised enforcement approach throughout the Community. Commission Directive 2002/70/EC of 26 July 2002 establishing requirements for the determination of levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feedingstuffs(3)provides that a product intended for animal feeding shall be considered as non-compliant with the established maximum level if the analytical result confirmed by duplicate analysis and calculated as the mean of at least two separate determinations exceeds the maximum level beyond reasonable doubt taking into account the measurement uncertainty. There are different possibilities to estimate the expanded uncertainty(4).\n\n((12)) The scope of Directive 2002/32/EC covers the possibility of establishing maximum levels of undesirable substances in feed additives. Since high levels of dioxins have been found in trace elements, a maximum level should be established for dioxins and the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs for all additives belonging to the functional group of compounds of trace elements and the maximum levels should be extended to all additives belonging to the functional group of binders and anti-caking agents and to premixtures.\n\n((13)) In order to encourage a proactive approach to reducing the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs present in food and feed, action levels were set by Commission Recommendation 2002/201/EC of 4 March 2002 on the reduction of the presence of dioxins, furans and PCBs in feedingstuffs and foodstuffs(5). Those action levels are a tool for competent authorities and operators to highlight those cases where it is appropriate to identify a source of contamination and to take measures to reduce or eliminate it. Since the sources of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs are different, separate action levels should be determined for dioxins on the one hand and for dioxin-like PCBs on the other hand.\n\n((14)) Directive 2002/32/EC provides for the possibility of setting action levels. The action levels should therefore be transferred from Recommendation 2002/201/EC to Annex II to Directive 2002/32/EC.\n\n((15)) The reduction of human exposure to dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs through food consumption is important and necessary to ensure consumer protection. As food contamination is directly related to feed contamination, an integrated approach must be adopted to reduce dioxin and dioxin-like PCB incidence throughout the food chain, i.e. from products intended for animal feed through food-producing animals to humans. A proactive approach is followed to actively reduce the dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in feed and food and consequently the maximum levels applicable should be reviewed within a defined period of time with the objective to set lower levels. Therefore consideration will be given by 31 December 2008 at the latest to significantly reducing the maximum levels for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.\n\n((16)) Operators need to make efforts to step up their decontamination capacity to remove effectively dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish oil. Further efforts have to done by the operators to investigate the different possibilities to remove dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs from fish meal and fish protein-hydrolysates. Once the decontamination technology is also available for fish meal and fish protein hydrolysates, operators will have to do efforts to provide for sufficient decontamination capacity. The significant lower maximum level for the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs, to which consideration shall be given by 31 December 2008, shall be for fish oil, fish meal and fish protein hydrolysates based on the technical possibilities of the most effective, economically viable, decontamination procedure. As regards fish feed, this significant lower level shall be determined based on the technical possibilities of the most effective, economically viable, decontamination procedure for fish oil and fish meal.\n\n((17)) The extraction procedure used for the analysis of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs has a large influence on the analytical result in particular on products intended for animal feed of mineral origin and it is therefore appropriate to determine before the date of application the extraction procedure to be used for the analysis of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.\n\n((18)) Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((19)) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnexes I and II to Directive 2002/32/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 4 November 2006 at the latest.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 30 September 1986
accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electronic typewriters originating in Japan manufactured by Tokyo Juki Industrial Co Ltd/JDK Corporation, and terminating the investigation
(86/490/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 (2) the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of electronic typewriters originating in Japan, including those manufactured by Tokyo Juki Industrial Co Ltd/JDK Corporation (Tokyo Juki).
(2) Subsequently it was decided, insofar as Tokyo Juki was concerned, to review Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 and annul the anti-dumping duty in view of, on the one hand, the completely changed circumstances in that company's particular situation and, on the other hand, the fact that Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 does not fully state with regard to Tokyo Juki the reasons why anti-dumping measures were taken.
(3) The Commission therefore announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (3), the initiation of a review proceeding concerning imports into the Community of electronic typewriters originating in Japan, and manufactured by Tokyo Juki, and commenced an investigation. The Council thereupon adopted Regulation (EEC) No 113/86 (4), amending Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 accordingly.
(4) The Commission officially advised the exporter and importer known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, and the complainants, of the review proceeding and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(5) The exporter concerned made its views known in writing, requested and was granted a hearing.
(6) No submissions were made by Community purchasers of electronic typewriters.
(7) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
EEC producer:
- TA Triumph-Adler AG, Nuernberg, Federal Republic of Germany;
EEC importers:
- Juki (Europe) GmbH, Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany,
- MVB Marketing en Verkoop Van Bedrijfsmachines BV, Rosmalen, The Netherlands.
(8) The Commission requested and received written submissions from the Community producers concerned, and some importers, and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
(9) The period 1 January to 31 December 1985 has been fixed for the investigation of dumping.
B. Dumping margin
(10) Tokyo Juki did not submit detailed information on the basis of which the dumping margin could be calculated. Tokyo Juki however agreed to the Commission proceeding with provisional duties on the basis that 'the actual margins of dumping are at least as high as the amount of any duties'.
C. Injury
(11) Injury to the Community industry, resulting from dumped imports of electronic typewriters originating in Japan, was definitively established in Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85. No fresh evidence, showing that the Community industry is no longer in need of protection, has been submitted. On the contrary, since the change in Tokyo Juki's circumstances, its imports into the Community have increased significantly.
(12) With regard more specifically to sales in the Community of electronic typewriters exported by Tokyo Juki, it was found that, during the period of the investigation, such sales followed a similar pattern to sales by the other Japanese exporters that were previously investigated, and against whose dumped exports the Community adopted definitive measures. It was therefore concluded that, in general, the same methodology as described in detail in points 33 to 36 of Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 should be used in order to determine the level of duty to be applied to imports into the Community of electronic typewriters manufactured by Tokyo Juki. A provisional determination revealed a difference between Tokyo Juki's 1985 sales prices in the Community and the target prices of the Community industry for 1985 of 25 %, expressed as a percentage of cif value.
D. Community interest
(13) Regulation (EEC) No 1698/85 sets out in detail the reasons why it is in the Community's interest to take action in favour of the Community industry against dumped imports of electronic typewriters originating in Japan. No reason could be seen why a different conclusion in the respect should be drawn. The Commission has come to the conclusion that action should be taken.
E. Undertaking
(14) The exporter concerned was informed of the main findings of the investigation. An undertaking was subsequently offered by Tokyo Juki, concerning its sales of electronic typewriters in the Community, which the Commission is satisfied would remove the effects of any injury caused to the Community industry.
In these circumstances the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the investigation may, therefore, be terminated wihtout imposition of anti-dumping duties.
No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee.","{'title': '86/490/EEC: Commission Decision of 30 September 1986 accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of electronic typewriters originating in Japan manufactured by Tokyo Juki Industrial Co.

Whereas:
(1) The accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia to the European Union on 1 May 2004 should enable those countries to qualify for the tariff quotas for pigmeat provided for under the arrangements established by Decisions 2003/18/EC and 2003/286/EC under fair conditions compared with those applicable to the existing Member States. Economic operators in those countries must be given the possibility therefore of participating fully in those quotas upon accession.
(2) In order not to create disturbance on the market before and after 1 May 2004, the timetable for the tranches provided for in 2004 by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/97 of 29 September 1997 laying down rules of application in the pigmeat sector for the arrangements under the Europe Agreements with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Poland and Hungary(4) must be altered and the allocation of quantities adjusted without however altering the overall quantities provided for in Decisions 2003/286/EC and 2003/18/EC.

Whereas:
(1) Cases of foot-and-mouth disease were discovered on 20 February, 13, 21 and 22 March 2001 in the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Ireland. These triggered the adoption of protective measures in the United Kingdom by Commission Decision 2001/145/EC(3), replaced by Decision 2001/172/EC(4), in its turn amended by Decision 2001/190/EC(5); in France by Commission Decision 2001/208/EC(6); in the Netherlands by Commission Decision 2001/223/EC(7) and in Ireland by Commission Decision 2001/234/EC(8).
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999(9), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 90/2001(10), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000(11) lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999(12), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2884/2000(13), lays down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68(14), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1587/96(15), as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products.
(5) The lengthy procedures for the issue of animal health certificates practised by certain Member States relating to the protective measures adopted by the relevant Decisions and measures taken by third countries resulting in import restrictions have adversely affected the financial interests of the exporters. The situation thus created has affected export opportunities under the conditions laid down in Regulations (EC) No 174/1999, (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1291/2000.
(6) Those adverse effects must be limited by the adoption of special measures, and certain time limits laid down in Regulations (EC) No 174/1999, (EC) No 800/1999 and (EC) No 1291/2000 relating to certain export operations which could not be completed because of the circumstances mentioned, should be extended. In particular, operators who have already competed customs export formalities or placed their products under customs supervision should be allowed the same benefit derived from extending the term of licence validity by means of extending the transport time limit as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.
(7) Only those operators who can prove, on the basis of the documents referred to in Article 1(2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4045/89(16), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3235/94(17), that they were unable to carry out the export operations within the time limits laid down as a result of the circumstances mentioned above should be allowed to benefit from the derogations.

A possibility for an annual financing agreement also to amend, as appropriate, provisions laid down in another prior annual financing agreement, inter alia, the period of commitment, should be provided for.
(2) Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 provides that the Commission shall apply the decommitment rule set out in Article 31(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1447/2001(4), laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds. As no Commission decision conferring management to agencies in applicant countries could be taken in 2000 it is appropriate to extend the limit date for decommitment of the 2000 commitment.
(3) Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 limits eligibility to expenditure paid by beneficiaries from the date of the Commission decision conferring financial management on the agency designated by the applicant country.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, and in particular the first paragraph of Article 88, and Articles 4, 47, 67 and 86 thereof;
Whereas by the Laws of 17 and 18 July 1959 and of 14 July 1966, the Kingdom of Belgium has introduced certain measures of aid which include State guarantees, subsidies in the form of interest rebates and capital bonuses and also tax concessions in the form of exemption from the advance levy on immovable property and from accelerated amortization;
Whereas iron and steel undertakings are in certain circumstances eligible for one or more of the measures of aid introduced by those laws;
Whereas Article 4 (c) of the ECSC Treaty prohibits aids to the iron and steel industry, such prohibition extending also to general measures of aid which favour the steel sector in particular;
Whereas State aids amount to actions by a Member State which are liable to have appreciable repercussions on conditions of competition in the steel industry ; whereas Article 67 (1) of the ECSC Treaty provides that such actions must be brought to the knowledge of the High Authority by the State concerned;
Whereas the Commission is responsible for ascertaining whether aids granted by Member States for the iron and steel industry fall under the provisions of Article 4 (c) and, if not, how such aids must be looked upon having regard to the provisions of Article 67 (2) and (3) of the ECSC Treaty;
Whereas Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the Treaty place the Member States under the obligation to supply all relevant information which the Commission needs to carry out its task in a particular sector;
Whereas if information concerning the aids in question is provided in the form of an annual total, it is not possible to ascertain, for each grant of aid to the iron and steel industry, whether the conditions applied are identical to those applied in respect of other industries to which the same measures of aid are extended;
Whereas the Commission, by letter of 12 March 1970, No 70-22229, requested the Kingdom of Belgium to inform it of the measures already taken to aid the steel industry and of the aid proposed for the iron and steel industry under general aid measures;
Whereas on 13 May 1971 the Commission addressed a further letter, No 71-23837, to the Kingdom of Belgium, since the latter had not replied to letter No 70-22229 of 12 March 1970;
Whereas the letter of 13 May 1971 invited the Kingdom of Belgium to supply detailed information within two months on aids granted for individual iron and steel investments during 1970 ; amount of credit and/or subsidy, duration, rate of interest, deferred amortization and tax concessions;
Whereas the Kingdom of Belgium was also invited within two months to complete the list of aids granted to the iron and steel industry by answering a number of questions;
Whereas that letter clearly reaffirmed that where general or regional measures of aid in favour of investment projects for the iron and steel industry are applied, the Commission has to be informed thereof ; whereas the Member States cannot escape that obligation on the grounds that general systems of aid  cannot be subject to a specific examination under the provisions of the Treaty of Paris;
Whereas the Belgian State forwarded, by letter of 14 July 1971, information to complete the list of aid to the iron and steel industry ; whereas that Member State has however not forwarded the information on investment asked for in the Commission's letter of 13 May 1971;
Whereas the Commission had allowed two months for the provision of this information, which should be sufficient time for the purpose;
Whereas the provision of incomplete information and failure to communicate certain information requested by the Commission in the letters of 12 March 1970 and 13 May 1971 constitute, in the opinion of the Commission, a failure to fulfil the obligations which devolve upon the Belgian State under Articles 47, 67 and 86 of the ECSC Treaty;
Whereas by letter No 72-20061 of 6 January 1972 the Commission invited the Kingdom of Belgium in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 88 to furnish within two months from the date of that letter its comments with regard to the failure in question;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1) and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 16(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2) provides that Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3) shall apply as regards exports of products in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty.
(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods' importation into a third country.
(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) No 646/2004 of 6 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty(4), Commission Regulation (EC) No 644/2004 of 6 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty(5), Commission Regulation (EC) No 645/2004 of 6 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain cereal and rice products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty(6), and Commission Regulation (EC) No 643/2004 of 6 April 2004 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to eggs and egg yolks exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty provide that export refunds are not to be set in respect of goods not covered by Annex(7) to the Treaty when exported to Cyprus and Poland and in respect of goods not referred to in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 999/2003(8) when exported to Hungary.
(5) The authorities in Cyprus, Hungary and Poland have consequently undertaken to allow imports of the goods concerned, which have been taken under customs control after 6 April 2004, to their territories only if they are accompanied by documents showing that they have been imported directly from the Community.
(6) In order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), and in particular Article 3(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(9) The Management Committee for Oils and Fats has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 299/2004 of 19 February 2004 fixing the export refunds on olive oil', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(2)(c) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 20 February 2004.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 February 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ 172, 30.9.1966, p. 3025/66.

THE COMMISSION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 973/2001(2), and in particular Article 45(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In November 2000, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicated that the stock of hake in ICES subareas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES Division VIIIa,b,d,e is at serious risk of collapse.
(2) The majority of the stock inhabits ICES subareas V, VI, and VII and ICES Divisions VIIIa,b,d,e.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 of 14 June 2001 establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of hake in ICES subareas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES Divisions VIIIa,b,d,e and associated conditions for the control of activities of fishing vessels(3) lays down a number of additional technical measures relevant to the recovery of this stock.
(4) Those technical measures will remain in force until 1 March 2002. However, by that date the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 will not have been achieved. An interruption of the application of the measures would cause serious harm to the stock of hake.
(5) Therefore immediate action in conformity with conditions laid down in Article 45(1) of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 is required to ensure that the measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 continue to apply until the revision of Regulation (EC) No 850/98 is adopted by the Council.
(6) Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1162/2001 provides a derogation which is justified by the fact that the limit on the catches of hake would cause serious economic problems for small fishing vessels working on a daily basis. The derogation has negligible consequences regarding the conservation and recovery of the hake stock.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 2602/2001 of 27 December 2001 establishing additional technical measures for the recovery of the stock of hake in ICES subareas III, IV, V, VI and VII and ICES Divisions VIIIa,b,d,e', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation shall apply to fishing vessels operating within ICES subareas V and VII and ICES Divisions VIIb,c,f,g,h,j,k and ICES Divisions VIIIa,b,d,e.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas Article 3(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 introduces an exemption scheme for duties on imports into French Guiana and aid for the supply by the rest of the Community of certain cereal products used in feedingstuffs;

Whereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the combined nomenclature annexed to the Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 it is necessary to adopt measures concerning the classification of the following goods:
1. lightweight panels of rectangular or square shape made up of a plate of expanded polystyrene covered on both sides by a sheet of paper. The total thickness of the paper is less than 10 % of the total thickness of the article;
2. lightweight panels of rectangular or square shape made up of a layer of expanded polystyrene covered on both sides by a sheet of white kaolin-coated paper not containing fibres obtained by a mechanical process and weighing more than 150 g/m2. The total thickness of the paper is at least 10 % of the total thickness of the article;
Whereas the combined nomenclature annexed to the said Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 - refers under code 3921 11 00 to ‘other plates, sheets, film, foil and strip, of plastics: - cellular: - of polymers of styrene and under code 4810 12 00 to ‘paper and paperboard, coated on one or both sides with kaolin (china clay) or other inorganic substances, in rolls or sheets, of a kind used for writing, printing or other graphic purposes, not containing fibres obtained by a mechanical process or of which not more than 10 % by weight of the total fibre content consists of such fibres, weighing more than 150 g/m2’; whereas, for the classification of the abovementioned goods, the said CN codes should be taken into consideration;
Whereas the abovementioned goods are made up of two different materials and should, pursuant to general rule 3 (b) for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, be classified according to the material which gives them their essential character;
Whereas the said goods can clearly fall only within Chapter 39 or Chapter 48 according to their composition; whereas it seems advisable to distinguish between these two chapters on the basis of the total thickness of the sheets of paper covering both sides of the polystyrene plate or layer in relation to the total thickness of the goods; whereas it is desirable to fix the total thickness of the paper at less than 10 % (classification in Chapter 39) or 10% or more (classification in Chapter 39);

Acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 31 July 2007 (3),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29 July 1991 on the development of the Community’s railways (4) was designed to facilitate the adaptation of the Community’s railways to the requirements of the single market and to improve their efficiency.
(2) Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure (5) concerns the principles and procedures to be applied with regard to the setting and charging of railway infrastructure charges and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity.
(3) In its White Paper European transport policy for 2010: time to decide, the Commission announced its intention to continue building the internal market in rail services by proposing to open up the market in international passenger services.
(4) The aim of this Directive is to address the opening of the market for international rail passenger services within the Community, and it should therefore not concern services between a Member State and a third country. In addition, Member States should be able to exclude from the scope of this Directive services transiting the Community.
(5) International rail services currently present a very contrasting picture. Long-distance services (for instance night trains) are in difficulty and several of them have recently been withdrawn by the railway undertakings operating them in order to limit losses. The market for international high-speed services, on the other hand, has seen a sharp increase in traffic and will continue its vigorous development with the doubling and interconnection of the trans-European high-speed network by 2010. Nevertheless, there is strong competitive pressure from low-cost airlines in both cases. It is therefore essential to stimulate new initiatives by promoting competition between railway undertakings.
(6) It is not possible to open up the market in international passenger services without detailed provisions on infrastructure access, substantial progress on interoperability and a strict framework for rail safety at national and European level. All of these elements are now in place following the transposition of Directive 2001/12/EC (6) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC, Directive 2004/51/EC (7) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 amending Council Directive 91/440/EEC, Directive 2001/13/EC (8) of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 amending Council Directive 95/18/EC, Directive 2001/14/EC, and Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on safety on the Community’s railways (9). It is necessary for this new regulatory framework to be supported by established, consolidated practice by the proposed date for opening up the market for international passenger services. This will require a certain time. The target date for opening up the market should therefore be 1 January 2010.
(7) The number of railway services without intermediate stops is very limited. In the case of journeys with intermediate stops, it is essential to authorise new market entrants to pick up and set down passengers along the route in order to ensure that such operations have a realistic chance of being economically viable and to avoid placing potential competitors at a disadvantage to existing operators, which have the right to pick up and set down passengers along the route. This right should be without prejudice to Community and national regulations concerning competition policy.
(8) The introduction of new, open-access, international services with intermediate stops should not be used to bring about the opening of the market for domestic passenger services, but should merely be focused on stops that are ancillary to the international route. On that basis, their introduction should concern services whose principal purpose is to carry passengers travelling on an international journey. The determination of whether that is the service’s principal purpose should take into account criteria such as the proportion of turnover, and of volume, derived from transport of domestic or international passengers, and the length of the service. This determination should be made by the respective national regulatory body at the request of an interested party.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2007 on public passenger transport services by rail and by road (10) authorises Member States and local authorities to award public service contracts. These contracts may contain exclusive rights to operate certain services. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the provisions of that Regulation are consistent with the principle of opening up international passenger services to competition.
(10) Opening up international passenger services, which include the right to pick up passengers at any station located on the route of an international service and to set them down at another, including stations located in the same Member State, to competition may have implications for the organisation and financing of rail passenger services provided under a public service contract. Member States should have the possibility to limit the right of access to the market where this right would compromise the economic equilibrium of these public service contracts and where approval is given by the relevant regulatory body referred to in Article 30 of Directive 2001/14/EC on the basis of an objective economic analysis, following a request from the competent authorities that awarded the public service contract.
(11) Some Member States have already moved towards opening up the market for rail passenger services by transparent, open competitive tendering for the provision of certain such services. They should not have to provide full open access to international passenger services, since this competition for the right to use certain rail routes has involved a sufficient test of the market value of running those services.
(12) The assessment of whether the economic equilibrium of the public service contract could be compromised should take into account predetermined criteria such as the impact on the profitability of any services which are included in a public service contract, including consequential impacts on the net cost to the competent public authority that awarded the contract, passenger demand, ticket pricing, ticketing arrangements, location and number of stops on both sides of the border and timing and frequency of the proposed new service. Respecting such an assessment and the decision of the relevant regulatory body, Member States might authorise, modify or deny the right of access for the international passenger service sought, including the levying of a charge on the operator of a new international passenger service, in line with the economic analysis and in accordance with Community law and the principles of equality and non-discrimination.
(13) In order to contribute to the operation of passenger services on lines fulfilling a public service obligation, Member States should be able to authorise the authorities responsible for those services to impose a levy on passenger services which fall within the jurisdiction of those authorities. That levy should contribute to the financing of public service obligations laid down in public service contracts awarded in conformity with Community law. It should be imposed in accordance with Community law, and in particular with the principles of fairness, transparency, non-discrimination and proportionality.
(14) The regulatory body should function in a way which avoids any conflict of interests and any possible involvement in the award of the public service contract under consideration. In particular, if for organisational or legal purposes it is closely linked to the competent authority involved in the award of the public service contract under consideration, its functional independence should be ensured. The competence of the regulatory body should be extended to allow the assessment of the purpose of an international service and, where appropriate, the potential economic impact on existing public service contracts.
(15) This Directive constitutes a further phase of the opening of the rail market. Some Member States have already opened up the market for international passenger services on their territory. In this context, this Directive should not be understood as creating obligations for those Member States to grant, before 1 January 2010, access rights to railway undertakings licensed in a Member State where similar rights are not granted.
(16) In order to encourage investment for services using specialised infrastructure, such as high-speed railway lines, applicants need to be able to plan and require legal certainty reflecting the substantial long-term investment involved. It should therefore be possible for those undertakings normally to conclude framework agreements with a term of up to 15 years.
(17) The national regulatory bodies should, on the basis of Article 31 of Directive 2001/14/EC, exchange information and, where relevant in individual cases, coordinate the principles and practice of assessing whether the economic equilibrium of a public service contract is compromised. They should progressively develop guidelines based on their experience.
(18) The application of this Directive should be evaluated on the basis of a report to be presented by the Commission two years after the date of opening up the market in international passenger services. This report should also assess the development of the market, including the state of the preparation of a further opening-up of the passenger rail market. In this report the Commission should also analyse the different models for organising this market and the impact of this Directive on public service contracts and their financing. In so doing, the Commission should take into account the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1370/2007 and the intrinsic differences between Member States (density of networks, number of passengers, average travel distance). In its report the Commission should, if appropriate, propose complementary measures to facilitate any such opening, and should assess the impact of any such measures.
(19) The measures necessary for the implementation of Directives 91/440/EEC and 2001/14/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (11).
(20) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adapt the Annexes to those Directives. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of those Directives, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(21) A Member State which has no railway system, and no immediate prospect of having one, would be under a disproportionate and pointless obligation if it had to transpose and implement Directives 91/440/EEC and 2001/14/EC. Therefore, such Member States should be exempted, for as long as they have no railway system, from the obligation to transpose and implement these Directives.
(22) Since the objective of this Directive, namely the development of the Community’s railways, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, given the need to ensure fair and non-discriminatory conditions of access to infrastructure and to take account of the obviously international dimension of the way in which important parts of the rail networks operate, as well as the need for coordinated transnational action, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(23) In accordance with point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making (12), Member States are encouraged to draw up, for themselves and in the interests of the Community, their own tables illustrating, as far as possible, the correlation between this Directive and the transposition measures, and to make them public.
(24) Directives 91/440/EEC and 2001/14/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '3.12.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 315/44', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2007/58/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 23\xa0October 2007\namending Council Directive 91/440/EEC on the development of the Community’s railways and Directive 2001/14/EC on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Directive 91/440/EEC of 29\xa0July 1991 on the development of the Community’s railways(4)was designed to facilitate the adaptation of the Community’s railways to the requirements of the single market and to improve their efficiency.\n\n((2)) Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26\xa0February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure(5)concerns the principles and procedures to be applied with regard to the setting and charging of railway infrastructure charges and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity.\n\n((3)) In its White Paper European transport policy for 2010: time to decide, the Commission announced its intention to continue building the internal market in rail services by proposing to open up the market in international passenger services.\n\n((4)) The aim of this Directive is to address the opening of the market for international rail passenger services within the Community, and it should therefore not concern services between a Member State and a third country.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 of 13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (1), and in particular Article 5(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, the grading of pig carcases is to be determined by estimating the lean-meat content by means of statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase. The authorisation of grading methods is subject to compliance with a maximum tolerance for statistical error in assessment. This tolerance is defined in Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85 of 24 October 1985 laying down detailed rules for the application of the Community scale for grading pig carcases (2).
(2) Commission Decision 92/469/EEC (3) authorises four methods for grading pig carcases in Denmark.
(3) Due to technical adaptations, Denmark has asked the Commission to authorise the update of four authorised methods and the utilisation of two updated methods (Autofom DK and FOM II), and has presented the results of its dissection trials in the second part of the protocol provided for in Article 3(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2967/85.
(4) Examination of this request has revealed that the conditions for authorising these grading methods are fulfilled.
(5) No modification of the apparata or grading methods may be authorised except by means of a new Commission Decision adopted in the light of experience gained. For this reason, the present authorisation may be revoked.
(6) For the sake of clarity, Decision 92/469/EEC should be repealed and replaced by a new decision.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of the Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '10.1.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 6/83', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 19 December 2008\nauthorising methods for grading pig carcases in Denmark\n(notified under document number C(2008) 8498)\n(Only the Danish text is authentic)\n(2009/12/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84, the grading of pig carcases is to be determined by estimating the lean-meat content by means of statistically proven assessment methods based on the physical measurement of one or more anatomical parts of the pig carcase.

Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) (hereinafter referred to as ""the basic Regulation""), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1973/2002(2), and in particular Article 20 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 164/2002(4), the Council imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire having a diameter 1 mm or more (hereinafter referred to as ""the product concerned"") falling within CN code ex 7223 00 19 originating in India. The measures took the form of ad valorem duties of between 0 % and 35,4 % on individual exporters, with a residual duty of 48,8 %.
B. CURRENT PROCEDURE
1. Request for review
(2) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, pursuant to Article 20 of the basic Regulation, from one Indian producer, Garg Sales Co. PVT Ltd (the applicant). The applicant claimed that it was not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India. Furthermore, it claimed that it had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998), but had exported the product concerned to the Community after that period. On the basis of the above, it requested that an individual duty rate be established for it.
2. Initiation of an accelerated review
(3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the applicant and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(5), an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the company concerned and commenced its investigation.
3. Non cooperation by the exporting producer
(4) In order to obtain the information it deemed necessary for its investigation, the Commission sent a questionnaire to the applicant. However, the Commission did not receive any reply to the questionnaire within the deadline set for that purpose. Neither did the applicant request an extension of that deadline. The Commission informed the applicant that in these circumstances it was intended to proceed with the termination of the review investigation without examining further its request for establishing an individual duty rate. The applicant was given a period of 10 days to comment. No comments from the applicant were received on the disclosure of the Commission's intention to terminate the review investigation.
(5) Consequently, it must be concluded that Garg Sales Co. PVT Ltd has failed to cooperate in the investigation by not replying to the questionnaire sent by the Commission. The accelerated review should therefore be terminated,",{'title': '2002/951/EC: Commission Decision of 3 December 2002 terminating the accelerated review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wire with a diameter of 1 mm or more originating in India'}

Whereas it is necessary to lay down a time limit for export of the said meat; whereas this time limit should be fixed by taking into account Article 5 (b) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 of 4 September 1980 on special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3182/88 (7);

amending Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards vaccination against bluetongue
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (3) lays down control rules and measures to combat and eradicate bluetongue, including rules on the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and the use of vaccines against bluetongue.
(2) In the past, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in the Union. Those incursions mainly occurred in the southern parts of the Union. However, since the adoption of Directive 2000/75/EC, and particularly since the introduction into the Union of bluetongue virus serotypes 1 and 8 in the years 2006 and 2007, the bluetongue virus has become more widespread in the Union, with the potential to become endemic in certain areas. It has therefore become difficult to control the spread of that virus.
(3) The rules on vaccination against bluetongue laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC are based on experience of the use of so-called ‘modified live vaccines’, or ‘live attenuated vaccines’, which were the only vaccines available when that Directive was adopted. The use of those vaccines may lead to an undesired local circulation of the vaccine virus in unvaccinated animals.
(4) In recent years, as a result of new technology, ‘inactivated vaccines’ against bluetongue have become available which do not pose the risk of undesired local circulation of the vaccine virus to unvaccinated animals. The extensive use of such vaccines during the vaccination campaign in the years 2008 and 2009 has led to a significant improvement in the disease situation. It is now widely accepted that vaccination with inactivated vaccines is the preferred tool for the control of bluetongue and for the prevention of clinical disease in the Union.
(5) In order to ensure better control of the spread of the bluetongue virus and to reduce the burden on the agricultural sector posed by that disease, it is appropriate to amend the current rules on vaccination laid down in Directive 2000/75/EC in order to take account of the recent technological developments in vaccine production.
(6) In order to enable the vaccination season 2012 to benefit from the new rules, this Directive should enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(7) The amendments provided for in this Directive should make the rules on vaccination more flexible and also take into account the fact that inactivated vaccines that can also be successfully used outside areas subject to animal movement restrictions are now available.
(8) In addition, and provided that appropriate precautionary measures are taken, the use of live attenuated vaccines should not be excluded, as their use might still be necessary under certain circumstances, such as following the introduction of a new bluetongue virus serotype against which inactivated vaccines may not be available.
(9) Directive 2000/75/EC should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '21.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 81/1', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2012/5/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 14 March 2012\namending Council Directive 2000/75/EC as regards vaccination against bluetongue', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue(3)lays down control rules and measures to combat and eradicate bluetongue, including rules on the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and the use of vaccines against bluetongue.\n\n((2)) In the past, only sporadic incursions of certain serotypes of the bluetongue virus were recorded in the Union.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 727/70 (1) of 21 April 1970 on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco, and in particular Articles 5 (5), 6 (9) and 6 (3) thereof;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission;
Whereas the creation of a single market in raw tobacco necessitates the application of Community intervention measures so that Community producers may dispose of their produce under conditions equivalent to those existing for most of the produce within the framework of national market organisations;
Whereas the need for intervention agencies to have leaf tobacco which they have bought in processed and prepared for market requires a distinction to be made between intervention centres handling first processing, market preparation and storage and intervention centres handling the collection and temporary warehousing of leaf tobacco, in order to facilitate delivery of the product offered for intervention; whereas a list of those centres should be drawn up to ensure that intervention provides those concerned with guarantees which are equivalent in all production regions of the Community;
Whereas implementation of Community intervention measures requires that intervention agencies take over tobacco under conditions which take particular account of regional differences in cultivation and curing methods for the different varieties of tobacco; whereas, consequently, the choice of intervention centres should be restricted to those nearest the place of production or first processing since these usually fulfil the above-mentioned conditions;
Whereas it is nevertheless important to ensure, wherever necessary, that the tobacco is sent to the intervention centre which has adequate reception and storage capacity and, where appropriate, is best suited to the variety or quality in question; whereas, therefore, the intervention agency should be allowed to decide where the tobacco is to be taken over in the light of the foreseeable costs for all the operations devolving upon the intervention agency;
Whereas it may be advisable, in certain cases, to choose a centre other than those nearest the place of production or first processing; whereas the intervention agency should bear the additional transport costs which may result from such a decision;
Whereas, by reason of the distinction between the place where the leaf tobacco is taken over and the place where it is first processed and prepared for market, the latter should be selected in the light of the foreseeable costs of all the operations devolving upon the intervention agency;
Whereas intervention should be restricted to qualities of tobacco which are reasonably certain to have a use; whereas for that reason any quality which does not correspond to the minimum quality characteristics to be defined in detailed rules of application should be barred from intervention;","{'title': 'Regulation (EEC) No 1467/70 of the Council of 20 July 1970 fixing certain general rules governing intervention on the market in raw tobacco', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe following shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 727/70:    (a) intervention centres (hereinafter called ""collection centres""), located in areas where there is substantial production of leaf tobacco, offering temporary warehousing capacity for that tobacco;\n\n(b) intervention centres (hereinafter called ""processing and storage centres"") offering temporary  (1)OJ No L 94, 28.4.1970, p. 1.\n\nwarehousing capacity and first processing and market preparation plants for leaf tobacco, and storage and preservation capacity for tobacco which has undergone first processing and market preparation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2908/84 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of copper sulphate originating in Poland. By the same Regulation, undertakings offered by the Bulgarian and Hungarian exporters concerned were accepted by the Commission.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Polish exporter and an importer concerned requested, and were granted, an opportunity to be heard by the Commission. Community producers also made written submissions making known their views on the duty.
C. Dumping
(3) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty and the Commission, therefore, considers its findings on dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2908/84 to be definitive.
D. Injury
(4) No new evidence regarding injury to the Community industry has been submitted and the Commission has, therefore, considered its findings on injury as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2908/84 to be definitive.
In the Commission's view, therefore, the facts as finally determined show that the injury being caused by dumped imports of copper sulphate originating in Poland, together with such imports from the countries from which undertakings have been accepted, taken in isolation from that caused by other factors, has to be considered as material.
E. Community interest
(5) No new evidence has been received by the Commission regarding its findings on the Community's interests as expressed in Regulation (EEC) No 2908/84 and the Commission, therefore, has confirmed these findings.
In these circumstances, protection of the Community's interest calls for action to be taken regarding imports of copper sulphate originating in Poland.
F. Undertakings
(6) The Polish exporter concerned, having been informed that the main findings of the preliminary investigation would be confirmed, offered an undertaking which the Commission considered would eliminate the dumping found and which was, therefore, considered acceptable.
G. Collection of provisional duties

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 9 and Article 9a(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 9a of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Union-wide quantity of allowances should be adjusted to reflect allowances issued in respect of installations that were included in the EU Emission Trading Scheme during the period from 2008 to 2012 pursuant to Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Union-wide quantity of allowances should also be adjusted in respect of installations that carry out activities listed in Annex I to the Directive and that are only included in the Union scheme from 2013 onwards.
(2) In accordance with Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC, Commission Decision 2010/384/EU of 9 July 2010 on the Community-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the EU Emission Trading Scheme for 2013 (2) based the absolute Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013 on the total quantities of allowances issued or to be issued by the Member States in accordance with the Commission decisions on their national allocation plans for the period from 2008 to 2012. As additional information has become available since the adoption of that Decision, it should be repealed and replaced.
(3) Further to applications by Member States for the unilateral inclusion of additional activities and gases in the Union scheme under Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, activities previously not included in the Union scheme were included in the scheme by Commission Decisions C(2008) 7867, C(2009) 3032 and C(2009) 9849. For the purpose of this Decision, applications pursuant to Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC should be taken into account where the Commission has approved their inclusion before 31 August 2010. It will remain possible to reflect in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013 inclusions approved by the Commission after this date. Pursuant to Article 9a(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Union-wide quantity of allowances is to be adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of the Directive from 2010 onwards.
(4) In accordance with Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community (3) Member States have brought into force national law, regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that the operators of installations carrying out activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC that are only included in the Union scheme from 2013 onwards, were able to submit to the relevant competent authority duly substantiated and independently verified emissions data. Such data is necessary, if it is to be taken into account for the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances. Member States were required to notify duly substantiated emission data to the Commission by 30 June 2010.
(5) To provide a level playing field for all installations, emissions data notified by Member States to the Commission should be adjusted to take into account the emission reduction effort that would have been expected from installations only included in the Union scheme as from 2013, had they been included in the Union scheme as from 2005. The Union-wide quantity of allowances is also to be adjusted pursuant to Article 9a(2) of the Directive by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of the Directive from 2010 onwards. In the event that new Member States join the Union, it will remain possible to reflect additional information in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances.
(6) Where Member States notified emissions from installations producing ammonia or soda ash, which will only be included in the Union scheme as from 2013, emissions serving as the basis for the calculation of the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances determined in this Decision, were taken into account assuming that these emissions represent emissions in the sense of Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87/EC. To guarantee consistency between the total quantity of allowances in the Union scheme, and the emissions for which allowances have to be surrendered, it will remain possible to revise the Union-wide quantity of allowances, if the Regulation to be adopted pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC deviates from this approach.
(7) To avoid double counting, only notified emissions with respect to activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC included in the scope of the Union scheme as from 2013, should be taken into account for the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances.
(8) Pursuant to Article 27 of Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States may exclude certain installations from the Union-wide scheme, if they notify the Commission of each of those installations by not later than 30 September 2011 and the Commission does not object. To date, the Commission has not received notifications from Member States in this respect. It will remain possible to reflect such exclusions in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013.
(9) It may be necessary to take into account additional information concerning the Union-wide quantity of allowances pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC, as determined by Decision 2010/384/EU when it becomes available. It will remain possible to reflect such additional information in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013.
(10) On the basis of information available since the adoption of Decision 2010/384/EU, the average annual total quantity of allowances issued by Member States in accordance with the Commission decisions on their national allocation plans for the period from 2008 to 2012, which is taken into account for the calculation of the Union-wide quantity of allowances pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC amounts to 2 037 227 209.
(11) For 2013, the absolute Union-wide quantity of allowances referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC amounts to 1 930 883 949.
(12) For 2013, the quantity of allowances issued in respect of installations that were included in the Union scheme during the period from 2008 to 2012 pursuant to Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC and adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of this Directive amounts to 1 328 218.
(13) For 2013, the quantity of allowances issued in respect of installations that are included in the Union scheme from 2013 onwards and adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of this Directive amounts to 106 940 715.
(14) On the basis of Article 9 and Article 9a, the total quantity of allowances to be issued from 2013 onwards is to annually decrease by a linear factor of 1,74 %, amounting to 37 435 387 allowances,","{'header': '23.10.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 279/34', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 22 October 2010\nadjusting the Union-wide quantity of allowances to be issued under the Union Scheme for 2013 and repealing Decision 2010/384/EU\n(notified under document C(2010) 7180)\n(2010/634/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 9a of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Union-wide quantity of allowances should be adjusted to reflect allowances issued in respect of installations that were included in the EU Emission Trading Scheme during the period from 2008 to 2012 pursuant to Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC.

It will remain possible to reflect in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013 inclusions approved by the Commission after this date. Pursuant to Article 9a(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the Union-wide quantity of allowances is to be adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of the Directive from 2010 onwards.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 2(1) of Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 amending Directive 2003/87/EC so as to improve and extend the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme of the Community(3)Member States have brought into force national law, regulations and administrative provisions to ensure that the operators of installations carrying out activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC that are only included in the Union scheme from 2013 onwards, were able to submit to the relevant competent authority duly substantiated and independently verified emissions data. Such data is necessary, if it is to be taken into account for the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances. Member States were required to notify duly substantiated emission data to the Commission by 30 June 2010.\n\n((5)) To provide a level playing field for all installations, emissions data notified by Member States to the Commission should be adjusted to take into account the emission reduction effort that would have been expected from installations only included in the Union scheme as from 2013, had they been included in the Union scheme as from 2005. The Union-wide quantity of allowances is also to be adjusted pursuant to Article 9a(2) of the Directive by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of the Directive from 2010 onwards. In the event that new Member States join the Union, it will remain possible to reflect additional information in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances.\n\n((6)) Where Member States notified emissions from installations producing ammonia or soda ash, which will only be included in the Union scheme as from 2013, emissions serving as the basis for the calculation of the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances determined in this Decision, were taken into account assuming that these emissions represent emissions in the sense of Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87/EC. To guarantee consistency between the total quantity of allowances in the Union scheme, and the emissions for which allowances have to be surrendered, it will remain possible to revise the Union-wide quantity of allowances, if the Regulation to be adopted pursuant to Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC deviates from this approach.\n\n((7)) To avoid double counting, only notified emissions with respect to activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC included in the scope of the Union scheme as from 2013, should be taken into account for the adjustment of the Union-wide quantity of allowances.\n\n((8)) Pursuant to Article 27 of Directive 2003/87/EC, Member States may exclude certain installations from the Union-wide scheme, if they notify the Commission of each of those installations by not later than 30 September 2011 and the Commission does not object. To date, the Commission has not received notifications from Member States in this respect. It will remain possible to reflect such exclusions in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013.\n\n((9)) It may be necessary to take into account additional information concerning the Union-wide quantity of allowances pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC, as determined by Decision 2010/384/EU when it becomes available. It will remain possible to reflect such additional information in future adjustments to the Union-wide quantity of allowances for 2013.\n\n((10)) On the basis of information available since the adoption of Decision 2010/384/EU, the average annual total quantity of allowances issued by Member States in accordance with the Commission decisions on their national allocation plans for the period from 2008 to 2012, which is taken into account for the calculation of the Union-wide quantity of allowances pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC amounts to 2\xa0037\xa0227\xa0209.\n\n((11)) For 2013, the absolute Union-wide quantity of allowances referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC amounts to 1\xa0930\xa0883\xa0949.\n\n((12)) For 2013, the quantity of allowances issued in respect of installations that were included in the Union scheme during the period from 2008 to 2012 pursuant to Article 24(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC and adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of this Directive amounts to 1\xa0328\xa0218.\n\n((13)) For 2013, the quantity of allowances issued in respect of installations that are included in the Union scheme from 2013 onwards and adjusted by the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of this Directive amounts to 106\xa0940\xa0715.\n\n((14)) On the basis of Article 9 and Article 9a, the total quantity of allowances to be issued from 2013 onwards is to annually decrease by a linear factor of 1,74\xa0%, amounting to 37\xa0435\xa0387 allowances,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nFor 2013, the total absolute Union-wide quantity of allowances referred to in Article 9 and Article 9a(1) and (2) of Directive 2003/87/EC amounts to 2\xa0039\xa0152\xa0882.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nDecision 2010/384/EU is repealed.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.'}]}"

Whereas the abovementioned Decision requires Member States to have prior authorization from the Commission before introducing intra-Community surveillance of the imports concerned;
Whereas the Portuguese Government has submitted an application to the Commission for such authorization in respect of motorcycles originating in Japan falling within Common Customs Tariff heading No ex 87.09, Nimexe code 87.09-10;
Whereas Portugal maintains quantitative restrictions on imports of the products in question because of the economic difficulties facing the sector concerned in Portugal;
Whereas, as a result, there are differences in the conditions governing the import of these products into the Member States and these differences are capable of causing deflections of trade;
Whereas the Portuguese authorities have pointed out that, as a result of the abolition between Portugal and the Community of all quantitative restrictions and measures having equivalent effect concerning the movement of the products in question, there is a risk of trade in products originating in Japan being deflected through the other Member States towards Portugal; whereas such deflections are capable of aggravating the continuing difficulties affecting the sector concerned in Portugal thus putting at risk achievement of the objectives of the abovementioned trade measures;
Whereas the Commission has examined the application of the Portuguese Government and this examination has shown that Portugal should be authorized to introduce intra-Community surveillance of motorcycles originating in Japan put into free circulation in the other Member States;

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 564/92 (13), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1826/93 (14), should be repealed with effect from 1 July 1993, which is the date of application of the Additional Protocols; whereas, however, import licences for  the quantities available for the period 1 July to 30 September 1993 have already been issued on the basis of the abovementioned Regulation; whereas in order to ensure a smooth transition to the new provisions and in particular to ensure that all the  quantities covered by the said licence, regardless of whether they have been imported already or not, benefit from the increase to 60 % in the rate of reduction of the levy, those quantities should be made subject to the provisions of this Regulation  and provision should be made for amounts overpaid to be reimbursed;
Whereas, in order to ensure proper administration of the system, the guarantee for import licences under the said system should be fixed at ECU 30 per 100 kg; whereas, in view of the likelihood of speculation inherent in the system in the pigmeat sector  precise conditions governing access by operators to the said system should be laid down;

Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular Article 8(2)(d), Article 8(3), Article 9(1)(c), and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2003/828/EC (2) provides for the demarcation of the global geographical areas where protection and surveillance zones (restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue. It also sets out the conditions for exempting certain movements of animals, their sperm, ova and embryos from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC (the exit ban).
(2) Following the evolution of the outbreak or new invasions of bluetongue in the Community from third countries, Decision 2003/828/EC has been amended several times to adapt the demarcation of those zones to new animal health conditions.
(3) For the sake of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/828/EC and to replace it by this Decision.
(4) Pursuant to Directive 2000/75/EC, the demarcation of protection and surveillance zones must take account of geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors connected with bluetongue and of the control arrangements. Taking account of those factors and arrangements as well as the information submitted by the Member States, it is appropriate to maintain the zones as set out in Decision 2003/828/EC, except in the case of Greece and Portugal.
(5) According to the latest scientific information available, movements of vaccinated animals may be considered safe irrespective of the virus circulation at the place of origin or the vectors activity at the place of destination. Therefore, exemptions from the exit ban for domestic movements as set out in Decision 2003/828/EC should be amended to take account of that scientific information.
(6) Decision 2003/828/EC includes Greece in the global geographical areas where restricted zones are to be established. Greece has submitted a duly substantiated request to the Commission in accordance with Directive 2000/75/EC requesting that Greece be deleted from the list of global geographical areas set out in Decision 2003/828/EC. Accordingly, it is appropriate to delete Greece from that list.
(7) Portugal has submitted a duly substantiated request to change the demarcation of the restricted zones set out in Decision 2003/828/EC as regards that Member State. Taking into account the geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors connected with bluetongue in the areas concerned in Portugal, the demarcation of those zones should be amended.

concerning Bulgaria’s application for protective measures with regard to a derogation from obligations under Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants
(notified under document C(2010) 2688)
(Only the Bulgarian text is authentic)
(2010/264/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania and the adjustments to the treaties on which the European Union is founded (1), and in particular Article 36 thereof,
Having regard to the application by Bulgaria,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants (2) aims to limit the emissions into air of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust from combustion plants with a rated thermal input of 50 megawatts (MW) or more. To this end, the Directive sets out emission limit values for these plants as well as monitoring and reporting obligations. For existing plants the emission limit values apply since 1 January 2008.
(2) Pursuant to Article 4(4) of Directive 2001/80/EC, certain existing plants can ‘opt out’. The precondition for such ‘opt out’ is that the operator of the plant had to notify the competent authorities that the plant would be operated not more than 20 000 hours between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. For those ‘opted out’ plants, the emission limit values of the Directive do not apply.
(3) During the accession negotiations Bulgaria obtained derogations from the application of the emission limit values under Directive 2001/80/EC for 4 combustion plants (TPP ‘Varna’, TPP ‘Bobov dol’, TPP ‘Ruse East’ and TPP ‘Lukoil Neftochim’).
(4) Bulgaria, by letter of 31 December 2009, applied to the Commission for authorisation to invoke Article 36 of the Act of Accession for protective measures, until 31 December 2014, in respect of five combustion plants (TPP ‘Bobov dol’, Brikel SJSC, Maritza 3 SJSC, TPP ‘Republika’ and TPP ‘Sliven’).
(5) TPP ‘Bobov dol’ has a derogation under the Accession Treaty for two units until 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2014, respectively; the third unit should have complied with the requirements of Directive 2001/80/EC from 1 January 2008 on.
(6) Brikel SJSC and Maritza 3 SJSC are opted out pursuant to Article 4(4) of Directive 2001/80/EC, therefore they cannot operate for more than 20 000 hours between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015.
(7) The Bulgarian authorities base their application upon the economic difficulties, which caused substantial delays in the investments required to upgrade or replace the plants concerned. Therefore, the plants would not be able to comply with the requirements of Directive 2001/80/EC in the foreseen time frame (under Directive 2001/80/EC or the Accession Treaty) and their operation would have to be ended. According to the application of Bulgaria, closure of the plants would put at risk the electricity and heat supply for the region of South-eastern and South-western Bulgaria. It would also lead to the closure of adjacent mines, whose operation depends on the coal demand of the combustion plants.
(8) Article 36 of the Act of Accession concerns only serious difficulties that arise as a result of application of internal market rules by the new Member State either for it or for the previous Members. Its aim is to temporarily lighten effects of the rules on the country’s economy but it does not allow derogations from the EU’s acquis in other policy areas such as environmental legislation.
(9) The alleged difficulties of Bulgaria are not a consequence of the EU’s internal market rules but relate to compliance with EU environmental legislation. They are not short-term difficulties having arisen during the 3 years after Bulgaria’s accession to the EU. They existed already at the time of drafting the Act of Accession, and the Annex VI embodying transitional measures applicable to Bulgaria, including those concerning Directive 2001/80/EC.
(10) Bulgaria’s application falls therefore out of the scope of Article 36 of the Act of Accession and should be rejected as inadmissible,","{'header': '6.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 113/56', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 4 May 2010\nconcerning Bulgaria’s application for protective measures with regard to a derogation from obligations under Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants\n(notified under document C(2010) 2688)\n(Only the Bulgarian text is authentic)\n(2010/264/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants(2)aims to limit the emissions into air of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust from combustion plants with a rated thermal input of 50 megawatts (MW) or more.

Whereas:
(1) Member States had to implement Directive 2000/76/EC before 28 December 2002 and will have to report about the implementation in accordance with a questionnaire to be developed by the Commission.
(2) The overall purpose of this questionnaire is, through Member States’ responses, to gather information on the implementation of Directive 2000/76/EC, and to identify approaches to regulating incineration and co-incineration plants across Member States.
(3) The reporting period has to cover the first full three years after 28 December 2002, and has to be defined taking into account the reporting requirements of Directive 94/67/EC and 96/61/EC. Taking into account that Directive 2000/76/EC applies in full to all existing plants from 28 December 2005 onwards, and since the overwhelming majority of plants operated in the EU belong to the group of existing plants, and that Directive 94/67/EC is repealed as of 28 December 2005, and reporting under Directive 96/61/EC covers the period to 2006-2008 inclusive, the most appropriate first full reporting period is 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2008.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), in particular Article 6(2),
Whereas:
(1) Newcastle disease is an infectious viral disease of poultry and other captive birds with a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State, but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products.
(3) Council Directive 92/66/EEC (2) sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus.
(4) In accordance with Article 84 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.
(5) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. Pursuant to Articles 3(2) and 6(2) of that Decision, Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate Newcastle disease.
(6) Article 3(6) of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union.
(7) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate Newcastle disease is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 (4).
(8) Outbreaks of Newcastle disease occurred in Cyprus. Cyprus took measures in accordance with Directive 92/66/EEC to combat those outbreaks.
(9) The authorities of Cyprus informed the Commission and the other Member States in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health of the measures applied in accordance with Union legislation on notification and eradication of the disease and the results thereof.
(10) The authorities of Cyprus have therefore fulfilled their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 3(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(11) At this stage, the exact amount of the financial contribution from the Union cannot be determined as the information on the cost of compensation and on operational expenditure provided are estimates.
(12) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '7.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 328/121', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 5 December 2013\non a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to combat Newcastle disease in Cyprus in 2013\n(notified under document C(2013) 8560)\n(Only the Greek text is authentic)\n(2013/724/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Newcastle disease is an infectious viral disease of poultry and other captive birds with a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.\n\n((2)) In the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State, but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products.\n\n((3)) Council Directive 92/66/EEC(2)sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 84 of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council(3), the commitment of expenditure from the Union budget shall be preceded by a financing decision setting out the essential elements of the action involving expenditure and adopted by the institution or the authorities to which powers have been delegated by the institution.\n\n((5)) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures.

initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 584/96 on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel transhipped through Taiwan, and making such imports subject to registration
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 905/98(2) and in particular Articles 13(3) and 14(5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Basic Regulation"") to investigate the alleged circumvention of the anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 584/96(3) on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel (hereinafter referred to as ""tube and pipe fittings"") originating in the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as ""the PRC""). According to the request, the aforementioned anti-dumping measures are allegedly circumvented by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings transhipped, without undergoing substantial transformation, through Taiwan. Furthermore, a request was made to make these imports subject to registration by the Customs authorities pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation and, where justified, to propose to the Council the extension of the above anti-dumping measures to these imports.
B. APPLICANT
(2) The request has been lodged on 11 June 1999 by the Defence Committee of the EEC steel butt-welding fittings industry on behalf of producers representing approximately 90 % of the Community production of tube and pipe fittings.
C. PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the allegation of circumvention is tube and pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, currently classifiable within CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90. These codes are given for information only.
D. EVIDENCE
(4) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence in accordance with the requirements of Article 13 of the Basic Regulation, that the anti-dumping measures on imports of tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel originating in the PRC are being circumvented by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings transhipped through Taiwan.
(5) The evidence submitted is as follows:
(a) The request shows that a clear change in the pattern of trade between the PRC, Taiwan and the Community has taken place, following imposition of provisional measures in 1995 and definitive measures in 1996. Volumes of imports originating in the PRC, recorded under CN codes within which the tube and pipe fitting are classified, have decreased from 3941 tonnes in 1995 to 503 tonnes in 1996, and 283 tonnes in 1998, i.e. a total decrease by 93 % or 3658 tonnes. Concomitantly, imports of the same product from Taiwan have increased from 1442 tonnes in 1995 to 6920 tonnes in 1996, and 5321 tonnes in 1998, i.e. a total increase over the period by 269 %, or 3879 tonnes. The total decrease of Chinese imports (3658 tonnes) nearly exactly corresponds to the total increase of Taiwanese imports (3879 tonnes).
This change in the pattern of trade is alleged to stem from a transhipment of Chinese tube and pipe fittings via Taiwan, where they undergo none or minor modification, for which there is insufficient due course or economic justification other than the existence of the anti-dumping duty of 58,6 % on tube and pipe fitting originating in the PRC.
(b) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing anti-dumping duties on tube and pipe fittings are being undermined in terms of quantities and prices. Indeed, imports of the product subject to investigation consigned from Taiwan have replaced those previously imported from the PRC in terms of quantities; in addition, while prices of imports from the PRC have remained more or less stable over the period 1995 to 1998, prices of imports from Taiwan have decreased by 26 % and have almost reached the level of the Chinese export prices prior to the imposition of measures.
(c) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence which shows that dumping is taking place in relation to the normal value previously established.
E. PROCEDURE
(6) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13 of the Basic Regulation and to make imports from Taiwan of tube and pipe fittings subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the said Regulation.
(i) Questionnaires
(7) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to Taiwanese exporting producers and traders named in the request. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(8) Other interested parties should request a questionnaire from the Commission within 15 days from publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Any request for questionnaires must be made in writing to the address mentioned below and should indicate the name, address, telephone, fax numbers and E-Mail address of the requesting party.
(9) The authorities of the PRC as well as of Taiwan will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(ii) Certificates of non-circumvention
(10) In accordance with Article 13(4) of the Basic Regulation, certificates exempting the imports of the product concerned from registration or measures may be issued by the Customs authorities to importers if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(11) Since the issue of this certificate requires the prior authorisation of the Community institutions, requests for such authorisations should be addressed by interested importers to the Commission as early as possible in the course of the investigation so that they may be considered on the basis of a thorough appraisal of their merits.
F. REGISTRATION
(12) Pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this investigation on tube and pipe fittings transhipped through Taiwan.
G. TIME LIMIT
(13) In the interest of sound administration, a period of 40 days from the date of publication of this Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Communities shall be fixed within which interested parties, provided they can show that they are likely to be affected by the results of the investigation, may make their views known in writing. The same period shall apply for interested parties who wish to make a written request for a hearing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
H. NON-COOPERATION
(14) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, provisional or final findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the Basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available. Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made of facts available,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 1683/1999 of 28 July 1999 initiating an investigation concerning the alleged circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 584/96 on imports of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel originating in the People's Republic of China by imports of the same tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel transhipped through Taiwan, and making such imports subject to registration"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn investigation, pursuant to Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, concerning imports into the Community consigned from Taiwan of tube and pipe fittings (other than cast fittings, flanges and threaded fittings), of iron or steel (not including stainless steel), with a greatest external diameter not exceeding 609,6 mm, of a kind used for butt-welding or other purposes, falling within CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90, is hereby initiated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Articles 13(3) and 14(5) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community consigned from Taiwan of certain tube and pipe fittings of iron or steel falling within the CN codes ex 7307 93 11, ex 7307 93 19, ex 7307 99 30 and ex 7307 99 90, Taric codes 7307 93 11 90, 7307 93 19 90, 7307 99 30 91 and 7307 99 90 91.\n\nRegistration shall, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Regulation (EC) No 384/96, expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n\nImports shall not be subject to registration where they are accompanied by a Customs certificate issued in accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Whereas these common programmes are essential in order to achieve the objectives pursued by the Matthaeus programme and, in particular, the uniform application of Community law at the external frontiers of the Community;
Whereas these common programmes are rendered necessary by the diversity of education given in the Member State customs schools;
Whereas it is essential to introduce as a priority a common training programme for officials in initial training; whereas this programme shall include customs subjects as a whole and the principles of the common commercial and agricultural policies, as  well as the principles of indirect taxation by reason of the close ties existing between Community customs law and all these disciplines;
Whereas some international conventions constitute an important source of Community law and that consequently it is essential that customs officials are acquainted with the provisions inherent in these conventions and their impact on Community law;
Whereas it is essential that this programme allocates a large area to education on the European Communities and their foundations, as customs officials are increasingly required to act on behalf of the Community as a whole;

Whereas Commission Decision 96/239/EC of 27 March 1996 on emergency measures to protect against bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (3) prohibits the exportation of live bovine animals, or any part of them, from the United Kingdom to other Member States and their export to third countries as a result of the incidence of BSE in the United Kingdom; whereas the United Kingdom has prohibited the introduction of bovine animals of more than 30 months at the time of slaughter into the human food and animal feed chains; whereas these measures involve serious disturbances in the market of the United Kingdom; whereas it is therefore necessary to take exceptional measures to support this market; whereas it is appropriate to establish a Community co-financed scheme authorizing the United Kingdom to purchase the animals covered by the abovementioned prohibition with a view to killing and subsequently destroying them;
Whereas, in view of the extent of the disease, in particular, of its probable duration, and consequently of the magnitude of the efforts needed to support the market, it would be appropriate for such efforts to be shared by the Community and the United Kingdom;
Whereas, in most cases animals slaughtered above the age of 30 months are cull cows; whereas the most recently observed price of carcases of cows on the United Kingdom market was equivalent to ECU 1 per kilogram live weight and that it is therefore appropriate to base the purchase price on this, without prejudice to the possibility of subsequent adjustment in the light of developments; whereas, in similar cases the Community has contributed to the overall expenditure incurred at a rate of 70 %; whereas a price of ECU 1 per kilogram is equal on average to a price of ECU 560 per animal; whereas it is appropriate, in view of the large numbers of animals concerned and in the interests of simplification, to provide a Community contribution of ECU 392 per animal;
Whereas, it is necessary to ensure that the animals concerned are killed and destroyed in a manner which does not pose any threat to human health or the health of other animals; whereas, it is therefore necessary to specify the conditions for the destruction of these animals and of the controls to be carried out by the United Kingdom authorities; whereas, so as to avoid that animals to be slaughtered under this scheme mix with animals not covered by this scheme and that mistakes as to identity occur, they should be kept separately in the lairage to a slaughterhouse, as well as in the slaughterhouse itself;

Those changes need to be reflected in Articles 5 and 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001 (3) and in Part H of Annex I to that Regulation.
(2) Whilst the current quota is managed on the basis of a yearly period running from July to June, the increased quota will be managed on a calendar year basis. By way of derogation from Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, which provides for division into two equal parts for 6-month periods, the available quantity for 2012 should take account of the quantity of 2 000 tonnes already made available in 2011 for the first half of 2012. Consequently, only a quantity of 1 600 tonnes should be available for the subperiod which, for organisational reasons, is to start on 1 March 2012. However, this Regulation should be without prejudice to the quantity of 2 000 tonnes already made available for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2012.
(3) Since the period for lodging import licence applications for the first half of 2012, as provided for in Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001, has expired, provision should be made for a new period for submitting import licence applications and for a derogation from that Article in relation to the quantity of 1 600 tonnes for the subperiod March-June 2012. In order to avoid that applicants who already lodged applications in November 2011 for the quantity of 2 000 tonnes would be excluded from the new submission period, it is appropriate to provide for a derogation from Article 6(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 of 31 August 2006 laying down common rules for the administration of import tariff quotas for agricultural products managed by a system of import licences (4).
(4) Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1301/2006 provides for the notification of the quantities covered by import licences within 2 months of expiry of the validity of the licences in question. However, for purposes of good management, it is necessary for the Commission to have this information at an earlier stage.

Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Council Directive 2002/33/EC(2), and, in particular, Article 10 (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 16 April 2003 the veterinary authorities of Belgium have informed the Commission about a strong suspicion of avian influenza in the province of Limburg.
(2) Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can pose a serious threat for the poultry industry.
(3) The Belgian authorities have immediately, before the official confirmation of the disease, implemented the measures foreseen in Council Directive 92/40/EEC(3) introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza while further confirmatory diagnostic procedures are carried out.
(4) Council Directive 92/40/EEC sets out the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. The Member State may take more stringent action in the field covered by this Directive if deemed necessary and proportionate to contain the disease, taking into account the particular epidemiological, animal husbandry, commercial and social conditions prevailing.
(5) The Belgian authorities have in co-operation with the Commission, put in place a nation-wide standstill for transport of live poultry and hatching eggs, which includes a prohibition of dispatch of live poultry and hatching eggs to Member States and third countries. However, in view of the specificity of poultry production, movements of hatching eggs, day-old chicks, ready-to-lay pullets and poultry for immediate slaughter may be authorised within Belgium. Furthermore the dispatch to Member States and third countries of fresh, unprocessed manure and litter of poultry should also be prohibited.
(6) Fresh poultry meat destined for intra-Community trade has to be marked with a health mark in accordance with the health mark foreseen in Chapter XII of Annex I of Directive 71/118/EEC(4), as last amended by Council Directive 97/79/EC(5). In order to allow the marketing on the Belgian market of fresh poultry meat obtained from poultry originating from the established surveillance zones special provisions for its health marking shall be laid down.
(7) The Belgian authorities should reinforce bio-security and hygiene measures including cleaning and disinfection procedures to prevent the further spread of the disease at all levels of poultry and egg production.
(8) In order to avoid the spread of the infection and after evaluation of the epidemiological situation the preventive culling of poultry at risk may be appropriate and decided by the Belgian authorities.
(9) These measures should be urgently adopted by the Commission for the sake of clarity and transparency, in collaboration with the Belgian authorities.
(10) The situation shall be reviewed at the meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 23 April 2003,","{'title': '2003/275/EC: Commission Decision of 16 April 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to a strong suspicion of avian influenza in Belgium (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 1335)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Examination of the balance sheet shows that exportable amounts of rice are currently held by producers. This situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the marketing year 2003/04.
(2) In order to remedy this situation, it is appropriate to grant export refunds in respect of zones which may be supplied by the Community. The particular circumstances of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the refunds, and therefore to apply Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 enabling the amount of the export refund to be fixed by tendering procedure.
(3) It should be stated that the provisions of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 584/75 of 6 March 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of the system of tendering for export refunds on rice(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1948/2002(4), apply to this invitation to tender.
(4) With a view to sound market management, the tender should be limited to certain zones listed in the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2145/92/94(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 3304/94(6), while some destinations should be excluded.
(5) Under Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2808/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of the agrimonetary system for the euro in agriculture(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 816/2003(8), the amounts quoted in tenders submitted in response to invitations to tender organised under an instrument forming part of the common agricultural policy must be expressed in euro. Article 5(1) of that Regulation provides that in such cases the operative event for the agricultural exchange rate is the final day for the submission of tenders.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a  proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for  derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to  prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2003(2), and in particular Article 12(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) A significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar into the Community from Serbia and Montenegro was registered since the beginning of 2001. Exports of sugar from the Community to this country also increased significantly in 2001. This development of trade in both directions appeared highly artificial, leading the Commission services to meet in March 2002 and to decide to take action with a view to clarify the situation.
(2) By letter dated 8 April 2002, the competent authorities of Serbia and Montenegro were requested to provide explanations for the situation and to fully cooperate with both the Commission and the Member States concerned in dealing with this matter.
(3) On 12 April 2002, the Commission called on the Member States to proceed with requests for subsequent verification of proofs of origin concerning sugar imported into the Community from Serbia and Montenegro and to take such precautionary measures as are necessary in order to safeguard the Community's financial interests.
(4) On 26 June 2002, the Commission published a notice to importers(3) stating that there was reasonable doubt as to the proper application of the preferential arrangements for sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 which was declared at import as originating in Serbia and Montenegro.
(5) Article 2(1)(a) and (c) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 subjects the entitlement to benefit from the preferential arrangements to compliance with the definition of the concept of ""originating products"" provided for in Title IV, Chapter 2, section 2 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(5), and to the involvement of beneficiaries in effective administrative cooperation with the Community in order to prevent any risk of fraud.
(6) Article 110(6) and (7) of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 lays down the responsibility for the competent governmental authorities of the country or territory benefiting from the preferential arrangements to take any steps necessary to verify the origin of the products and to check the other statements of the certificate, including by calling for any documentary evidence or carrying out any checks which they consider appropriate.
(7) Article 110(1), second indent, of that same Regulation lays down the obligation for the beneficiary country or territory to assist the Community by allowing the customs authorities of Member States to verify the authenticity of the proof of origin or the accuracy of the information regarding the true origin of the products in question. Article 122 provides to this end for methods of administrative cooperation, according to which the competent governmental authorities of the beneficiary country or territory shall carry out, on request from the customs authorities of a Member State, subsequent verifications of the authenticity of the proof of origin, the originating status of the products concerned or the fulfilment of the other relevant requirements.
(8) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 states that, where the Commission finds that there is failure to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin, or a failure of compliance with the provisions of Article 2(1) of the Regulation by a country or territory covered by the Regulation, it may under certain conditions take measures to suspend in whole or in part the arrangements provided for in the Regulation for a period of three months.
(9) According to findings recently made in Serbia and Montenegro, the current system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 does not allow the competent authorities of this beneficiary country to verify the originating status of the products and to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin. As a consequence of this, it has to be concluded that Serbia and Montenegro does not comply with the provisions of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.
(10) The Commission therefore considers that the conditions laid down in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 are fulfilled and that the preferential arrangements should be suspended for a period of three months, insofar as sugar of CN codes 1701 or 1702 declared as originating in Serbia and Montenegro is concerned.
(11) The Customs Code Committee has been informed accordingly,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 764/2003 of 30 April 2003 suspending for a period of three months, with regard to sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 imported from Serbia and Montenegro, the arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe preferential arrangements provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 for sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 imported from Serbia and Montenegro are suspended for a period of three months.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 April 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrederik Bolkestein\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 240, 23.9.2000, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 86, 3.4.2003, p. 18.\n\n(3) OJ C 152, 26.6.2002, p. 14.\n\n(4) OJ L 253, 11.10.1993, p. 1.\n\n(5) OJ L 68, 12.3.2002, p. 11.'}]}"

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) The Council by Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 (2) (the definitive Regulation) imposed definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China (original investigation).
B.   NEW EXPORTER REVIEWS
(2) In the original investigation sampling was applied to the Chinese exporting producers. The non-sampled companies which were granted market economy treatment (MET), in accordance with the provisions of Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, were attributed the 0 % dumping duty which was established for the sole sampled company which was granted MET. The non-sampled companies which were granted individual treatment (IT), in accordance with the provisions of Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, received the weighted average duty of 28,6 % established for the sampled companies that were granted IT. A country-wide duty of 47,8 % was imposed on all other companies.
(3) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, a new exporter review to determine individual dumping margins could not be initiated in this proceeding, as sampling was used in the original investigation. However, in order to ensure equal treatment between any new exporting producer and the cooperating companies not included in the sample of the original investigation, it is considered that provision should be made in order to respectively impose the duty applicable to the companies which received MET (0 %) or the weighted average duty of companies with IT (28,6 %), to any new exporting producers which can demonstrate that they meet the criteria set in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation in order to be granted MET or otherwise the criteria of Article 9(5) in order to be granted IT, and that they would therefore be entitled to a review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation.
C.   UNDERTAKINGS
(4) Upon publication of the definitive Regulation, no undertakings could be accepted by the Commission. During the investigation leading to the imposition of definitive measures, several exporting producers had indicated their intention to offer a price undertaking but failed to submit sufficiently substantiated undertaking offers within the deadlines set in Article 8(2) of the basic Regulation. Nevertheless, as set out in recital 152 of the definitive Regulation, the Council, in view of the complexity of the issue for the economic operators in question (predominantly small- and medium-sized enterprises) and given that the definitive disclosure was not preceded by a provisional disclosure, considered that they should exceptionally be allowed to complete their undertaking offers beyond the said deadline.
(5) Subsequent to the deadline mentioned above, the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products (CCCME) together with twenty cooperating companies or groups of cooperating companies offered an acceptable joint undertaking.
(6) The Commission by Decision 2006/109/EC (3), accepted the undertaking offer. The Decision sets out in more detail the reasons for accepting this undertaking. The Council recognises that the undertaking offer eliminates the injurious effect of dumping and limits to a sufficient degree the risk of circumvention.
(7) To further enable the Commission to effectively monitor compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the anti-dumping duty will be conditional upon the presentation of a commercial invoice containing at least the elements listed in the Annex to this Regulation. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that shipments correspond to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
(8) To further ensure the effective respect of the undertaking, the importers should be made aware that any violation of the undertaking may lead to the retrospective application of the anti-dumping duty for the relevant transactions. Therefore, it is necessary to implement legal provisions providing for the incurrence of a customs debt at the level of the appropriate anti-dumping duty whenever one or more conditions for the exemption are not respected. A customs debt should therefore be incurred whenever the declarant has chosen to release the goods for free circulation, i.e. without collection of anti-dumping duty, and one or several conditions of that undertaking are found to have been violated.
(9) In the event of a breach of the undertaking, the anti-dumping duty may be recovered, provided that the Commission has withdrawn the acceptance of the undertaking in accordance with Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation, by referring to that particular transaction and, accordingly, by declaring the relevant undertaking invoice as invalid. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14(7) of the basic Regulation, customs authorities should inform the Commission immediately whenever indications of a violation of the undertaking are found.
(10) The companies concerned and the CCCME have been informed of the essential facts, considerations and obligations upon which the acceptance of the undertaking is based.
(11) It should be noted that in the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking or in case of a withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the anti-dumping duty shall automatically apply, pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '17.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 47/3', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 268/2006\nof 14 February 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 1212/2005 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain castings originating in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1212/2005 is hereby amended as follows:\n1.\nthe following paragraph shall be added to Article 1:\n‘4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Where any new exporting producer in the People’s Republic of China provides sufficient evidence to the Commission that:\n—\nit did not export to the Community the product described in paragraph 1 during the investigation period (1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004),\n—\nit is not related to any of the exporters or producers in the People’s Republic of China which are subject to the anti-dumping measures imposed by this Regulation,\n—\nit has actually exported to the Community the product concerned after the investigation period on which the measures are based, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community,\n—\nit operates under market economy conditions defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively that it fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation,\nthe Council, acting by simple majority on a proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee, may amend paragraph 2 by adding the new exporting producer (i) to the companies subject to the duty rate of 0\xa0% applicable to companies to whom market economy treatment was granted in accordance with Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or (ii) to the companies subject to the weighted average duty rate of 28,6\xa0% applicable to companies to whom individual treatment was granted in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation respectively.’;\n2.\nthe following Article shall be added after Article 1:\n‘Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Imports declared for release into free circulation which are invoiced by companies from which undertakings are accepted by the Commission and whose names are listed in Commission Decision 2006/109/EC\n(\n4\n)\n, as from time to time amended shall be exempt from the anti-dumping duty imposed by Article 1, on condition that:\n—\nthey are manufactured, shipped and invoiced directly by the said companies to the first independent customer in the Community, and\n—\nsuch imports are accompanied by a valid undertaking invoice.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 31 and 34(2)(c) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 29 of the Treaty on European Union states that the Union's objective is to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters.
(2) The conclusions of the Tampere European Council call for cooperation in the fight against crime to be stepped up in order to achieve a genuine European area of justice.
(3) The Grotius programme, set up by Council Joint Action 96/636/JHA of 28 October 1996 on a programme of incentives and exchanges for legal practitioners (""Grotius"")(3), has helped step up cooperation between the Member States' judiciaries and improve mutual understanding of their legal and judicial systems.
(4) The renewal of the programme, expressly provided for by that Joint Action, would enable this cooperation to be improved.
(5) The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty brings judicial cooperation in civil matters under Article 61 of the Treaty establishing the European Community and, consequently, support for cooperation activities in this field has become the subject of a separate Commission initiative on the renewal of the Grotius ""Civil"" programme.
(6) It is desirable to ensure continuity for the general and criminal projects supported by the Grotius programme and to renew the programme for a second phase of two years.
(7) The Grotius criminal programme must be opened up further to the applicant countries by facilitating their participation in the projects supported by the programme.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Decision should be adopted in accordance with the procedures set out herein.
(9) A financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 34 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure(4), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of the programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the EC Treaty,","{'title': '2001/512/JHA: Council Decision of 28 June 2001 establishing a second phase of the programme of incentives and exchanges, training and cooperation for legal practitioners (Grotius II — Criminal)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nEstablishment of the programme\n\n1.

(1) Production of reproductive material of the species set out in the Annexes is at present insufficient in the Member States with the result that their requirements for reproductive material conforming to the provisions of Directives 66/404/EEC or 71/161/EEC cannot be met.
(2) Third countries are not in a position to supply sufficient reproductive material of the relevant species which can afford the same guarantees as Community reproductive material and which conforms to the provisions of the above mentioned Directives.
(3) The Member States should therefore be authorised to permit, for a limited period, the marketing of reproductive material of the relevant species which satisfies less stringent requirements to cover the shortage of reproductive material satisfying the requirements of Directives 66/404/EEC or 71/161/EEC.
(4) Whereas, for genetic reasons, the reproductive material must be collected at places of origin within the natural range of the relevant species and the strictest possible guarantees should be given to ensure the identity of the material.
(5) Whereas, furthermore, reproductive material should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question.
(6) Whereas each of the Member States should furthermore be authorised to permit the marketing in its territory of seed and seedlings which satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of provenance, or, in the case of reproductive material of Populus nigra, in respect of the category, as laid down in Directive 66/404/EEC, or seed which satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of specific purity as laid down in Directive 71/161/EEC, if the marketing of such material has been authorised in the other Member States under this Decision.

adapting to technical progress Directive 95/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/61/EEC of 30 June 1992 relating to the type-approval of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(1), as last amended by European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/7/EC(2) and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Having regard to Directive 95/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 February 1995 on the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles(3), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 95/1/EC is one of the separate directives under the Community type-approval procedure introduced by Directive 92/61/EEC. The provisions of Directive 92/61/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 95/1/EC.
(2) In order to enable the full type-approval system to function properly, it is necessary to clarify or supplement certain requirements of Directive 95/1/EC.
(3) To that end, it is necessary to specify the values to be entered in the test report to ensure the consistent application of Directive 95/1/EC in the case of mopeds, motorcycles and tricycles with spark-ignition engines and two- or three-wheel motor vehicles with compression-ignition engines.
(4) Directive 95/1/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13 of Council Directive 70/156/EEC(4), as last amended by Commission Directive 2001/116/EC(5),","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2002/41/EC of 17 May 2002 adapting to technical progress Directive 95/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the maximum design speed, maximum torque and maximum net engine power of two- or three-wheel motor vehicles', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annexes to Directive 95/1/EC are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in poultrymeat (1), and in particular Article 2(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) With effect from 1 January 2006 Council Directive 71/118/EEC of 15 February 1971 on health problems affecting the production and placing on the market of fresh poultrymeat (2) has been repealed by Directive 2004/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) and replaced by Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (4) and by Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin (5).
(2) Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (6) has been repealed and replaced by Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (7).
(3) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 (8) contains several references to Directive 71/118/EEC and to Directive 79/112/EEC. For reasons of clarity it is appropriate to adapt those references. Likewise, the definition of the term ‘carcass’ should be adapted to Annex III Section II Chapter IV(7)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004.
(4) The second indent of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 excludes from the scope of that Regulation the type of sales referred to in Chapter II Article 3(II) of Directive 71/118/EEC. This latter provision deals with an optional derogation for Member States concerning small-scale production of under 10 000 birds. Whilst Regulations (EC) No 852/2004 and (EC) No 853/2004 contain a derogation, which is neither optional nor limited to a specific number of birds, an optional derogation such as that in Article 3(II) of Directive 71/118/EEC, limited to a specific number of birds, should be retained for Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90.
(5) Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1906/90 contains a reference to Commission Directive 80/879/EEC of 3 September 1980 on the health marking of large packagings of poultrymeat (9). That Directive has been repealed by Council Directive 92/116/EEC of 17 December 1992 amending and updating Directive 71/118/EEC on health problems affecting trade in fresh poultrymeat (10). That reference is redundant and should be deleted.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 285 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty (1),
Whereas:
(1) The need to establish Europe-wide standards on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities led the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom (2), unanimously to endorse, at its meeting on 24 February 2005, the European Statistics Code of Practice (hereinafter referred to as the Code of Practice) as presented in the Recommendation of the Commission of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.
(2) The Code of Practice has the dual purpose of improving trust and confidence in statistical authorities by proposing certain institutional and organisational arrangements on the one hand and reinforcing the quality of the statistics they produce on the other.
(3) In the Communication of 25 May 2005 to the European Parliament and to the Council on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities, the Commission acknowledged the usefulness of an external advisory body that could play an active role in overseeing how the Code of Practice is implemented by the European Statistical System as a whole. In its Recommendation of 25 May 2005, the Commission stated its intention to consider proposing the establishment of such an external advisory body.
(4) On 8 November 2005, the Council concluded that a new high-level advisory body would enhance the independence, integrity and accountability of the Commission (Eurostat) and, in the context of the peer review assessment of implementing the Code of Practice, of the European Statistical System. The Council recommended that the body should be a small group of independent persons appointed on the basis of their competence.
(5) The members of that body should provide a complementary mix of skills and experience, drawing, for example, on people from academia and those with national and/or international professional experience in the field of statistics.
(6) The body should establish an assessment for the Commission (Eurostat) on the implementation of the Code of Practice analogous to the peer review of National Statistical Offices.
(7) A dialogue with the Statistical Programme Committee and the European Statistical Advisory Committee, established by Decision No 234/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3), on the Code of Practice, and also with Member States’ stakeholder bodies, should be encouraged where appropriate.
(8) An advisory board should therefore be established, and its tasks and structure defined, without prejudice to Article 5 of the Protocol on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank,","{'header': '15.3.2008 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 73/17', 'title': 'DECISION No 235/2008/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 11 March 2008\nestablishing the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The need to establish Europe-wide standards on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities led the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom(2), unanimously to endorse, at its meeting on 24 February 2005, the European Statistics Code of Practice (hereinafter referred to as the Code of Practice) as presented in the Recommendation of the Commission of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.\n\n((2)) The Code of Practice has the dual purpose of improving trust and confidence in statistical authorities by proposing certain institutional and organisational arrangements on the one hand and reinforcing the quality of the statistics they produce on the other.\n\n((3)) In the Communication of 25 May 2005 to the European Parliament and to the Council on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities, the Commission acknowledged the usefulness of an external advisory body that could play an active role in overseeing how the Code of Practice is implemented by the European Statistical System as a whole.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 27(1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorise any Member State to introduce or extend special measures for derogation from that directive in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas, by letter registered with the Commission's Secretariat-General on 20 July 1998, the United Kingdom Government requested authorisation to extend application of the derogation previously granted to it by Decision 95/252/EC and Decision 98/198/EC;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 22 September 1998 of the United Kingdom's request;
Whereas the derogation in question is designed, firstly, to restrict to 50 % the right of the hirer or leasee of a passenger car to deduct the VAT on the hire or leasing transaction where the car is used for private purposes and, secondly, to waive the VAT payable on the private use of the car in question;
Whereas the legal and factual circumstances which justified granting authorisation to apply a derogation have not changed and still obtain;
Whereas on 17 June 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Directive amending the Sixth Directive as regards the rules governing the right to deduct VAT (4);
Whereas the objective of that proposal is to bring about an approximation of the limitations of the right to deduct VAT in order to reduce the disparities between the rules applicable in the Community, particularly where expenditure on passenger cars is concerned;
Whereas it is appropriate, therefore, to extend the period of the authorisation granted until the entry into force of the abovementioned Directive; whereas, however, the authorisation will expire on 31 December 2000 at the latest if the Directive has not entered into force by that date, enabling an assessment to be made at that time of the expediency of the derogation in the light of the discussions held within the Council on the proposal for a Directive;

of 29 September 2005
fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 lays down that the export refund for a product contained in goods may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(5) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(6) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2560/77 (2), and in particular Article 17 (4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 876/68 of 28 June 1968 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on milk and milk products and criteria for fixing the amounts for such refunds (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2429/72 (4), and in particular Article 6 (2) thereof,
Whereas, in the interests of clarity, the following Regulations which need to be amended several times should be repealed and replaced by a single text:    - Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1611/68 of 15 October 1968 making special provision for the lowest rate of the refund applicable to exports of certain cheeses to third countries (5), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2786/73 (6),

- Commission Regulation (EEC) No 518/76 of 8 March 1976 concerning the application of the lowest rate of refund on exports of milk products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2188/74 (8);
Whereas the Annex to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1324/68 of 29 August 1968 laying down special conditions for the export of certain cheese to Switzerland (9), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2786/73 (10), should be amended to take account of the fact that in future ""Tilsit"" and ""ButterkĂ¤se"" fall within subheading 04.04 E I b) 5 of the Common Customs Tariff when they are exported to non-member countries;
Whereas, where the rate of export refund varies according to destination, Article 11 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 192/75 of 17 January 1975 laying down detailed rules for the application of export refunds in respect of agricultural products (11), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1469/77 (12), provides that the part of the refund calculated on the basis of the lowest rate of refund applicable on the day on which customs export formalities are completed is to be paid on proof being furnished that the product has left the geographical territory of the Community;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 441/69 of 4 March 1969 laying down additional general rules for granting export refunds on products subject to a single price system, exported unprocessed or in the form of certain goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty (13), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 269/78 (14), provides in the second subparagraph of Article 2 (4) and in Article 3 (1) for the part of the refund calculated on the basis of the lowest rates to be paid as soon as the product has been brought under the special arrangement introduced by the said Regulation;
Whereas, under the special arrangements with several non-member countries, the refund rate applicable on export to these countries of certain milk products may be lower, sometimes to a substantial degree, than the refund level normally applied ; whereas it might also arise that no refund is fixed;
Whereas, as regards Switzerland, special arrangements have been introduced both by Regulation (EEC) No 1324/68 in respect of certain cheeses and by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2074/73 of 31 July 1973 establishing the special conditions for the export of processed cheese to Switzerland (15) ; whereas a special arrangement was also provided for Austria as regards heading No 04.04 by Commission Regulation (EEC)  (1)OJ No L 148, 28.6.1968, p. 13.

Whereas the special arrangements for exports to Switzerland, Austria and Spain ensure that products which have received a refund for other destinations cannot be exported to these three countries ; whereas consequently, account should be taken of these special arrangements when applying the said provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 192/75 so as to avoid exporters having to bear unnecessary financial costs in trade with other non-member countries, by providing that, when determining the lowest rate of the refund, account should not be taken of the special refund rates fixed for the particular destinations in question at a level lower than that of the lowest refund applicable to other non-member countries ; whereas this exemption was provided for, except in the case of Austria, by Regulations (EEC) No 1611/68 and (EEC) No 1578/70;
Whereas the lowest rate of the refund can also result from the non-fixing of a refund;
Whereas as regards exports to the United States (Zone E) there exist cases of non-fixing of the refund for certain milk products ; whereas provision should also be made for an exemption when determining the lowest rate of the refund in cases where the measures introduced in the United States guarantee that the products which have benefited from a refund for other destinations may not be imported into Zone E ; whereas experience has shown that the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation may be covered by this exemption not only as regards the application of Article 11 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 192/76 but also that of Articles 2 (4) and 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 441/69 ; whereas these exemptions should be abolished for the products in respect of which the above conditions are no longer met ; whereas such a provision was provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 518/76;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN  COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
I. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 21,9 % on imports of VHS video tape in cassettes (hereinafter referred to as 'video cassettes') falling within CN code ex 8523 13 00 and originating in Hong  Kong, with the exception of imports from several exporters especially mentioned which were subject to a lesser rate of duty or exempt from duty.
(2) In recital 43 of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89, concerning companies which started or will start exporting own-produced video cassettes to the Community after the investigation period (newcomers), the Council noted that the Commission is ready to  initiate without delay a review proceeding if the exporting company can show the Commission, and supply to that effect sufficient evidence, that it did not export the products concerned tothe Community during the period of investigation. The company  also has to demonstrate that it started or will start those exports after the said period and that it is not related to or associated with any of the companies subject to the investigation.
II. REVIEW PROCEDURE
(3) By a notice published in the Official Journal (3) on 12 October 1991, the Commission, after consultaion within the Advisory Committee and in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 initiated a review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89  as it concerned a Hong Kong company, Bico Magnetics Ltd. That company had submitted that it had not exported the products subject to the anti-dumping duty during the original period of investigation (1 January to 30 November 1987). In addition, it  submitted that it was not related to any of the companies in respect of which dumping was found to have occurred in the previous investigation. Moreover, no evidence was found that it had ever exported video cassettes to the Community. Accordingly, the  Commission commenced an investigation in order to verify whether Bico Magnetics Ltd could be considered as a newcomer and to establish a dumping margin, if any, for that company.
III. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
1. Newcomer
(4) The investigation showed that Bico Magnetics Ltd had not previously exported or produced video cassettes which were exported to the Community and was now about to begin such exports. In addition, it was found that this company had no link of any  sort with the exporters involved in the previous procedure and for which dumping was found to have occurred. The Council confirms that it should accordingly be considered as a newcomer and that a partial review of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89, inasmuch  as it concerned Bico Magnetics Ltd, was warrented.
2. Normal value
(5) Since Bico Magnetics Ltd did not sell any video cassettes on the domestic market during the investigation period for this review (from 1 January to 30 June 1991), normal value was determined on the basis of the constructed value of the product  concerned in accordance with Article 2 (3) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. This constructed value was computed on the basis of all costs, both fixed and variable, in the country of origin of materials and manufacture for the models to be exported to  the Community plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative, other general expenses and profit.
(6) As far as selling, administrative and general expenses were concerned, they were calculated by reference to such expenses as they were stated in the audited accounts of Bico Magnetics Ltd. These costs corresponded to such costs incurred by other  Hong Kong manufacturers for their sales of video cassettes on the domestic market, as established during previous investigations concerning video cassettes from Hong Kong.
As far as profit was concerned, it was found appropriate to apply a profit rate of 8 % on turnover; this rate was used in Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 for the Hong Kong video cassette manufacturers and, according to the information available to the  Commission, can still be regarded as the profit which Hong Kong companies can normally achieve on their domestic market. The Council confirms these findings.
(7) On this basis, normal value was established for the models produced and destined for export to the Community by Bico Magnetics Ltd, namely normal grade.
3. Measures
(8) Since it was found that Bico Magnetics Ltd had not exported video cassettes to the Community, no export price could be established for the product under consideration, and no dumping margin could be calculated.
(9) However, it is clear that if the export prices of the various models of video cassettes sold for export to the Community by Bico Magnetics Ltd at least equalled the normal value for the corresponding models, these products would not be dumped.
(10) In addition, this normal value is less than the target price determined for the Community industry in Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89.
(11) In these circumstances, it is considered that the measures to be imposed in respect of the imports to the Community of video cassettes produced by Bico Magnetics Ltd, should guarantee that the products are not sold to the Community at less than  their normal value.
IV. AMENDMENT OF THE REVIEWED MEASURES
(12) Accordingly, it is considered appropriate that Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 should be amended and that Bico Magnetics Ltd be exempted from the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed on VHS video tapes in cassettes originating in Hong Kong in respect  of the models E60, E90, E120, E180, E195 and E240, in normal grade, insofar as these models will be subject to a duty equal to the difference between minimum price set out for each of these models and their net price, free-at-Community frontier, before  duty. The minimum price corresponds to the normal value duly adjusted to bring it to cif level.
(13) Bico Magnetics Ltd was informed of the essential facts and considerations on the basis of which the imposition of the anti-dumping duties was proposed, and was given an opportunity to comment on the proposal. No comments were made by exporting  producer concerned.
(14) The complainants were also informed of the considerations and main facts on the basis of which the Council intended to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 and had not comment to make.
(15) Since this review is only limited to one Hong Kong producer, it does not prolong the validity of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 with regard to Article 15 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1769/92 of 29 June 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89 in respect of the definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of video cassettes originating in Hong Kong', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe following subparagraph is hereby added to Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1768/89:\n\n'The entry specified in paragraph 2 (b) shall not apply to models of video tapes in cassettes E60-E90-E120, E180-E195-E240 in normal grade manufactured and sold for export to the Community by Bico Magnetics Ltd, Hong Kong (Taric additional Code 8292);  these models shall be subject to an anti-dumping duty equal to the difference between the price specified below for each of the models concerned and their net price, free-at-Community-frontier, before duty for those models:\n\nE60  E90  E120  E180  E195  E240         ECU 0,70  ECU 0,83  ECU 0,96  ECU 1,22  ECU 1,29  ECU 1,48'""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3667/91 lays down the method for administering the Community tariff quota for frozen beef falling within CN code 0202 and for products falling within CN code 0206 29 91 and splits this quota into two parts, one of 42 400  tonnes apportioned between traditional importers and the other of 10 600 tonnes apportioned between the operators which have engaged in beef trade with third countries;
Whereas, in order to ensure a smooth switchover from the arrangements based on national administration to arrangements subject to Community administration, while taking into account the commercial peculiarities of the products in question, provision  should be made for the allocation on a proportional basis of the first part to traditional importers who can prove that, during 1989, 1990 and 1991, they imported products covered by the quota; whereas, however, within the framework of the procedure  based on the submission of applications from interested parties and their acceptance to the extent determined by the Commission, importers who can demonstrate the genuine nature of their business, and who apply for quantities of some significance should  be granted access to the second part; whereas verification of the latter criterion requires that applications from a particular operator are to be submitted in the same Member State;
Whereas, in the light of the specific situation resulting from German unification, special rules should be laid down on access to the abovementioned second part by operators established in the territory of the former German Democratic Republic, in  respect of the reference years to be taken into consideration;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (4), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 92/91 (5), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products;  whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 839/91 (7), lays down special detailed rules on the system of import licences to the beef sector;

Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.
(6) The second indent of Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund on olive oil may be varied according to destination where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The refund must be fixed at least once every month. It may, if necessary, be altered in the intervening period.
(8) It follows from applying these detailed rules to the present situation on the market in olive oil and in particular to olive oil prices within the Community and on the markets of third countries that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.

In accordance with Decision No 3632/93/ECSC the Commission is required to take a decision on a  specific financial measure, namely aid for the year 1994 totalling £ 230 000 granted to Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd to cover operating losses.
The financial support, proposed by Lothian Regional Council, falls within the scope of Article 1  (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
The Commission is therefore required to decide, in accordance with Article 9 of the Decision,  whether the support is in conformity with the objectives and criteria of the Decision and is  compatible with the proper functioning of the common market.
II By Decision 94/574/ECSC (2), the Commission gave a favourable opinion on the conformity of the  modernization, rationalization and restructuring plan notified by the United Kingdom with the  general and specific objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
In accordance with that same Decision, the Commission authorized the United Kingdom to carry over  to the final quarter of the 1993/94 financial year and to the 1994/95 financial year the provision  authorized until 31 December 1993 for sums totalling respectively 2 187 759,71 and £  116 354  577,43 so that the operating aid may cover the operating losses of underground coalmining  undertakings, which include Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd.
By notification of 13 July 1994, the United Kingdom submitted to the Commission the refinancing  plan of Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd. This plan aims to refinance the company and to open a second  work face which should improve productivity and lead to a reduction in the cost of production per  tonne.
By letter of 12 September 1994, the United Kingdom informed the Commission that Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd forecast a negative result in its operating account of £ 1 115 554 for an estimated  amount of 520 000 tonnes of coal produced. This loss can be explained by the poor results in the  first half of the year before the technical and financial measures of the aforementioned plan had  been implemented.
Operating aid totalling £ 230 000 aimed at covering operating losses must be evaluated in  accordance with the aims of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and particularly with those set out in Article  2 (1). Given coal prices on the international markets, this support will enable Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd to make new progress towards economic viability and thus to stabilize in the  future. The support will also help to solve social and regional problems created by reductions in  the activity of production units in the Lothian area.
The proposed aid, together with that approved pursuant to Decision 94/574/ECSC, does not exceed,  for each tonne produced, the difference between production costs and the average foreseeable  revenue for the year 1994. It is therefore in compliance with the first indent of Article 3 (1) of  Decision No 3632/93/ECSC.
The coal produced by Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd will be largely bought by Scottish Power plc,  under a contract covering the period 1 April 1993 to 31 March 1998. The amount of operating aid per  tonne will not cause delivered prices for Community coal to be lower than those for coal of a  similar quality from third countries. The aid must not entail distortions of competition between  coal users. The United Kingdom supplied to the Commission the information required to calculate the  forecast costs of production and receipts per tonne. The information notified by the United Kingdom  Government has therefore allowed verification that the conditions of the third, fourth and fifth  indents of Article 3 (1) of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC are met in full.
Aid to cover operating losses at Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd aims to facilitate the modernization,  rationalization and restructuring plan of the British coalmining industry.
In the light of the foregoing and on the basis of the information supplied by the United Kingdom,  the proposed aid for current production at Monktonhall Mineworkers Ltd is compatible with the  objectives of Decision No 3632/93/ECSC and with the proper functioning of the common market.
III In accordance with the second indent of Article 3 (1) and Article 9 (2) and (3) of Decision No  3632/93/ECSC, the Commission will ensure that the aid authorized for current production complies  with the aims set out in Articles 3 and 4 of the Decision. To this end, it must be informed of the  amount paid and how it is distributed,","{'title': '94/999/EC: Commission Decision of 30 November 1994 authorizing the grant by the United Kingdom of aid to the coal industry for the year 1994 (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe United Kingdom is hereby authorized to grant Monktonhall  Mineworkers Ltd the sum of £ 230 000.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe United Kingdom shall inform the Commission, before 30 September 1995 of the amount  actually paid as a result of this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern  Ireland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 30 November 1994.\n\nFor the Commission Marcelino OREJA Member of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 329, 30. 12. 1994, p. 12.\n\n(2) OJ No L 220, 25. 8. 1994, p. 12.'}]}"

(2) pursuant to Article 7 of that Protocol, it is up to the Council, acting by a qualified majority, to adopt the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council;
(3) the aim of this integration is to ensure that, when the Schengen acquis is integrated into the framework of the European Union, application and development of the provisions relating to the acquis continue in conditions which ensure they function properly;
(4) the detailed arrangements for this integration should make it possible, on the one hand, to limit recruitment to the administrative needs arising for the General Secretariat of the Council from the new tasks it will have to perform and, on the other hand, to check the competence, efficiency and integrity of those recruited;
(5) the general budget of the European Communities for the financial year 1999 has made provision for the necessary permanent posts, broken down into category and grade, within the General Secretariat of the Council;
(6) the staff complement thus determined is necessary and sufficient to enable the General Secretariat of the Council to cope efficiently with the needs arising from integration of the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union;
(7) it is necessary, by way of derogation from the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, hereafter referred to as ""the Staff Regulations"", to adopt the arrangements necessary to enable the Appointing Authority (IAA) to appoint those concerned as probationer officials of the European Communities at the General Secretariat of the Council, with the appointments taking effect from the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam;
(8) such appointments should be subject to compliance by each of those concerned with certain conditions; such appointments should also be subject to the provision of supporting documents proving that those concerned were employed in various capacities at the Schengen Secretariat on the date on which the Treaty of Amsterdam was signed (2 October 1997), i.e. the date on which it was decided in principle to carry out that integration; and proving that those concerned were still employed there on the date of entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (1 May 1999) and were actually performing duties involved in applying and developing the Schengen acquis, assisting the Presidency and delegations, managing financial and budget matters, translating and/or interpreting, documentation or secretarial work, with the exception of technical or administrative duties for which the administrative needs do not require additional recruitment to the General Secretariat of the Council;
(9) it is also necessary to ensure, before those concerned are appointed as probationer officials, that they provide all supporting or other documents, diplomas, qualifications or certificates, which prove that they have the level of qualification or experience required to perform the duties involved in the category or service into which they are to be integrated;
(10) it is also necessary to specify that those recruited will, in accordance with Article 34 of the Staff Regulations, be obliged to serve a probationary period designed to check their ability to perform their duties satisfactorily, and that any decisions taken by the AA following the probationary period will be taken after consulting an ad hoc Committee appointed by the AA on which the Staff Committee of the General Secretariat of the Council may be represented,","{'title': '1999/307/EC: Council Decision of 1 May 1999 laying down the detailed arrangements for the integration of the Schengen Secretariat into the General Secretariat of the Council', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas examination of the balance sheet shows that exportable amounts of rice are currently held by producers; whereas this situation could affect the normal development of producer prices during the 1996/97 marketing year;
Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, it is appropriate to make use of export refunds to zones which may be supplied by the Community; whereas the special situation of the rice market makes it necessary to limit the quantities of rice benefiting from the refunds, and therefore to apply Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 enabling the amount of refund to be fixed by tendering procedure;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, hereinafter referred to as 'the Act' and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 303 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2306/88 (2), and in particular Articles 13 (2) and 16 (7) and the second subparagraph of Article 39 thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to the first and second subparagraphs of Article 303 of the Act, the maximum quantities of raw sugar to be imported at a reduced levy from certain ACP States, together with the relevant periods of application in order to supply the Portuguese refineries, have been determined by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 600/86 (3);
Whereas the third subparagraph of Article 303 of the Act provides in particular that, where, during the specified periods of application, the Community forward estimate for raw sugar for a given marketing year or part thereof shows that the availability of raw sugar is insufficient to ensure adequate supply of Portuguese refineries, Portugal may be authorized to import from third countries under the marketing year or part thereof concerned, the quantities which it is estimated are lacking, under the same conditions regarding the reduced levy as those provided for in respect of the quantities to be imported from the ACP States in question; whereas the forward estimate, for the period from 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 showed that the foreseeable shortfall could be fixed in a first stage by Commission Decision 88/462/EEC (4) at 120 000 tonnes to be imported from third countries in respect of the period 1 July 1988 to 31 January 1989; whereas the actual quantities of raw sugar available in the Community, and in particular production in the French department of RĂŠunion, and quantities available for refining are now known; whereas the remainder of the shortfall in respect of the period 1 February to 30 June 1989 should accordingly be fixed;
Whereas, in order to ensure sound management of the markets in the sector and, in particular, effective control of operations, it is necessary firstly to apply to the sugar concerned the normal rules for performance of the customs formalities for import and, secondly, to provide for notification by Portugal of the quantities of raw sugar imported and refined within the meaning of this Decision;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 95/408/EC of 22 June 1995 on the conditions for drawing up, for an interim period, provisional lists of third country establishments from which Member States are authorised to import certain products of animal origin, fishery products or live bivalve molluscs(1), as last amended by Council Decision 98/603/EC(2), and in particular Article 2(4) thereof,
(1) Whereas provisional lists of establishments producing rabbit meat and farmed game meat have been drawn up by Commission Decision 97/467/EC(3) as last amended by Commission Decision 98/556/EC(4);
(2) Whereas New Caledonia has sent a list of establishments producing rabbit meat and farmed game meat and for which the responsible authorities certify that the establishments are in accordance with Community rules;

suspending the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China
(2009/383/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 14(4) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) Following a review investigation carried out in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation (review investigation), the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 (2) imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China, presently falling within CN codes ex 2931 00 95 (TARIC code 2931009582) and ex 3808 93 27 (TARIC code 3808932719) (the product concerned), as extended to imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia (whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not) (TARIC codes 2931009581 and 3808932711) with the exception of those produced by Crop protection (M) Sdn. Bhd., Lot 746, Jalan Haji Sirat 4½ Miles, off Jalan Kapar, 42100 Klang, Selangor Darul Ehsan, Malaysia (TARIC additional code A309) and as extended to imports of glyphosate consigned from Taiwan (whether declared as originating in Taiwan or not) (TARIC codes 2931009581 and 3808932711) with the exception of those produced by Sinon Corporation, No 23, Sec. 1, Mei Chuan W. Rd, Taichung, Taiwan (TARIC additional code A310). The rate of the anti-dumping duty is 29,9 %.
(2) Audace, an association of users and distributors of the product concerned, has submitted information on a change of market conditions which occurred after the expiry review investigation period (i.e. from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2002), and alleged that such changes would justify the suspension of the measures currently in force, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently, the Commission examined whether such suspension was warranted.
B.   GROUNDS
(3) Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation provides that, in the Community interest, anti-dumping measures may be suspended on the grounds that market conditions have temporarily changed to an extent that injury would be unlikely to resume as a result of such suspension, provided that the Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and these comments have been taken into account. Article 14(4) further specifies that the anti-dumping measures concerned may be reinstated at any time if the reason for suspension is no longer applicable.
(4) With regard to the Community industry, it is noted that its situation has improved up to the first half of 2008. Due to a strong increase in prices on the EU market, an increase of the sales volume and value, and the relatively stable production costs, profits expressed as a percentage of turnover have increased significantly. These positive trends are confirmed by more recent figures for the main Community producer, which represents the large majority of the Community industry’s production and sales volume. On the basis of the market information currently available, it is not expected that this situation will change substantially in the event of a suspension of the measures.
(5) The Community industry has confirmed that, currently, the level of its prices on the EU market remains generally unchanged although export prices from the People’s Republic of China have dropped substantially since July 2008.
(6) The increasing production capacity and output in the People’s Republic of China could have a downward effect on EU glyphosate prices in the medium or long term. However, current information shows that this effect is expected to be to a large extent absorbed by a growing global demand.
(7) No indications have been found as to why the suspension would not be in the Community interest.
(8) In conclusion, given the temporary change in market conditions, and in particular the current level of prices on the Community market, together with the current high profit levels of the Community industry notwithstanding decreasing export prices from the People’s Republic of China in recent months, it is considered that the injury linked to the imports of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China is unlikely to resume as a result of the suspension. It is therefore proposed to suspend for nine months, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, the measures in force.
C.   CONSULTATION OF THE COMMUNITY INDUSTRY
(9) Pursuant to Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation, the Commission has informed the Community industry of its intention to suspend the anti-dumping measures in force. The Community industry has been given an opportunity to comment and their comments were taken into account.
D.   CONCLUSION
(10) The Commission therefore considers that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping duty imposed on the product concerned are met, in accordance with Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation. Consequently, the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 should be suspended for a period of nine months.
(11) Should the situation which led to the suspension change subsequently, the Commission may reinstate the anti-dumping measures by repealing the suspension of the anti-dumping duties forthwith,","{'header': '15.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 120/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 14 May 2009\nsuspending the definitive anti-dumping duties imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 on imports of glyphosate originating in the People’s Republic of China\n(2009/383/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1683/2004 on imports of glyphosate, falling within CN codes ex\xa02931\xa000\xa095 (TARIC code 2931009582) and ex\xa03808\xa093\xa027 (TARIC code 3808932719) and originating in the People’s Republic of China, as extended to imports of glyphosate consigned from Malaysia (whether declared as originating in Malaysia or not) (TARIC codes 2931009581 and 3808932711) with the exception of those produced by Crop protection (M) Sdn.

(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1001/2008 (2) under which imports into the Community of the product concerned originating in Malaysia, including the product concerned produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive antidumping duty of 75 % with the exception of one company expressly mentioned which is subject to an individual duty rate.
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Community during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 (the original investigation period) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product concerned which are subject to the abovementioned anti-dumping measures.
(5) The applicant further alleges that it has entered into irrevocable contractual obligations to export the product concerned to the Community in the near future.
E.   PROCEDURE
(6) Community producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment. No comments have been received.
(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, with a view to determine the applicant’s individual margin of dumping and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which their imports of the product concerned into the Community should be subject.
(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1001/2008.
(a)   Questionnaires
In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the parties making themselves known within the period provided for by the present Regulation.
F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(9) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Community by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(10) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
(a) interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation;
(b) interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(11) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(12) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(13) It is noted that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the incidence of cholera is rapdily increasing in certain parts of South America; whereas this disease is a serious threat to public health and the cholera vibrio can, inter alia, contaminate fruit and vegetables;
Whereas Community experts have visited the regions in question to look at the situation and decide what safeguards are required to prevent any risk of introduction of the disease into the Community;
Whereas their findings indicate that Community measures are required; whereas national measures have been adopted in a number of Member States on imports of fruit and vegetables from certain South American third countries; whereas it is incumbent upon  the Council therefore to adopt common rules which will protect the health of consumers, maintain market unity without unduly affecting trade between the third countries and the Community and prevent deflection of trade;
Whereas requirements to be met for imports of fruit and vegetables originating in, or consigned from, regions affected by cholera should be specified; whereas the list of these regions should therefore be determined and provision should be made for the  origin or place of consignment of the products to be mentioned on the accompanying document;
Whereas these requirements should not be made applicable to products which, because of their characteristics, the treatment they are given or the length of time spent in transport present no risk of contamination;
Whereas, further, these requirements should not be made applicable to consignments of fruit and vegetables covered by suitable guarantees from the official authorities of the exporting third country; whereas it is necessary therefore to specify the  recognized health authorities of the third countries in question;
Whereas Member States must be able to require presentation of health certificates made out by the authorities of the exporting third country; whereas the requirements pertaining to the drawing up and issuing of certificates must be specified;
Whereas experts from the Member States and from the Commission should make checks to see whether the health safeguards offered by the third countries concerned are applied effectively;
Whereas the aforementioned safeguards will apply without prejudice to normal requirements pertaining to imports from the third countries in question;
Whereas documentary or identification checks, as appropriate in each case, must be carried out on products intended for import when they first arrive in the Community; whereas such a check is required in order to guarantee free circulation within the  Community; whereas sample checks may also be made in the Member State of consumption to ensure the absence of cholera vibrio;
Whereas a simplified procedure should be set up that will permit continual rapid updating of Community rules in line with changes in the epidemiological situation as regards cholera; whereas, to this end, a Commission ad hoc committee should be set up;
Whereas bananas should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation since the ripening processes which these products undergo cancels out all risk of the cholera vibrio being introduced into the Community,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3185/91 of 22 October 1991 adopting measures for the import of fruit and vegetables from certain countries affected by cholera', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation sets rules applying to imports of:\n\n- fruit and vegetables covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1623/91 (2), and Regulation (EEC) No 827/68 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 789/89 (4),\n\n- processed fruit and vegetable products covered by Regulation (EEC) No 426/86 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1943/91 (6),\n\n- other fruit and vegetables falling within Chapters 7, 8 and 20 of the combined nomenclature and not covered by the abovementioned Regulations, with the exception of bananas,\n\noriginating in, or consigned from, the countries listed in Annex I which are affected by a cholera epidemic caused by the cholera vibrio of the 01 El Tor biotype, Inaba serotype.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1911/91  of 26 June 1991  on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 25 (4) thereof,
Having regard to the amended proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, by virtue of Article 25 of the Act of Accession, the Treaties and the acts of the institutions of the European Communities apply to the Canary Islands, subject to the derogations set out in that Article, in Article 155 and in Protocol 2 to the  said Act;
Whereas these arrangements exclude the Canary Islands in particular from the Community's customs territory and from application of the common commercial policy, the common agricultural policy and the common fisheries policy; whereas experience has  however shown that the development of the Canary Islands would be better served by their full integration into the common policies and the process of completing the internal market; whereas the arrangements laid down in the Act of Accession should  therefore be amended and the Canary Islands integrated into the Community's customs territory;
Whereas, pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 25 (4) of the Act of Accession, the Council, at Spain's request, acting on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting the European Parliament, may decide unanimously to include the Canary  Islands in the customs territory of the Community and to define the appropriate measures aimed at extending to the Canary Islands the provisions of Community law in force; whereas Spain made such a request on 7 March 1990 pursuant to the aforementioned
Article;
Whereas integration of the Canary Islands into all Community policies requires a gradual process over an appropriate transitional period, without prejudice to any special measures designed to take account of the specific constraints deriving from the  remoteness of the Canary Islands, their island location and their historical economic and tax arrangements; whereas such measures will have to be the subject of a special programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary  Islands, to be adopted pursuant to this Regulation;
Whereas application of the common agricultural policy to the Canary Islands will make possible the free movement of products on the conditions applicable to mainland Spain (end of the transitional period: 31 December 1995) with the exception of the  supplementary trade mechanisms as regards the supplying of the Canary Islands; whereas, in this framework, the free movement of products between the Canary Islands and the rest of Spain will be ensured; whereas full application of the common  agricultural policy is subject to the entry into force of specific supply arrangements; whereas the application of this policy will have to be accompanied in addition by specific measures relating to the agricultural production of the Canary Islands;  whereas it is therefore necessary to maintain the provisions of the Act of Accession relating to the application of the common agricultural policy to the Canary Islands until the entry into force of such supply arrangements with the exception of those  governing the access of agricultural products originating in the Canary Islands to the other parts of the Community; whereas the provisions of Protocol 2 relating to bananas must remain in force;
Whereas it is necessary to apply the common fisheries policy to the Canary Islands on the entry into force of this Regulation on the conditions applicable to mainland Spain (end of the transitional period: 31 December 1995), subject to specific measures  to be determined under existing legislation;
Whereas historical recognition of the Canaries' island status has been reflected in successive special economic and tax arrangements designed to compensate for the disadvantages deriving from the archipelago's geographical isolation;
Whereas, in this context, the strengthening of the Canary Islands' integration into the Community is not incompatible with the maintenance of indirect taxation specific to these islands, especially the exclusion of the Canary Islands from the  territorial field of application of the common VAT system pursuant to Article 26 in conjunction with Annex I, V, 2 to the Act of Accession, amending Article 3 (2) of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC (4) and the continuing exclusion of the Canary Islands  from the territorial field of application of the Directives concerning manufactured tobacco pursuant to Article 26 in conjunction with Annex I, V, 3 and 4 to the Act of Accession;
Whereas the Community takes favourable note of the aims of the reform initiated by Spain in respect of the tax aspects of the economic and tax arrangements for the Canary Islands; whereas this reform provides for the gradual introduction of up-to-date  indirect taxation as an instrument of economic and social development and the financing of local budgets, creating the conditions for total integration into the Community at the end of a transitional period not exceeding 10 years;
Whereas, until 31 December 2000 at the latest, in two five-year stages as part of a dynamic process in conjunction with the gradual entry of the Canary Islands into the customs union, it is desirable to authorize a number of total or partial exemptions  for local products from application of the new so-called 'arbitrio sur la production et sur les importations (APIM)' (tax on production and imports) tax, provided that these exemptions contribute to promotion of local activities; whereas, however,  application of this charge should be suspended for products coming under the common agricultural policy until the application of that policy, it being understood that, when these products are imported from non-member countries, the provisions in force  in the Canary Islands in respect of trade with such countries shall be maintained until the same date;
Whereas the dismantling of this charge will have to be accompanied by the gradual adoption of the common customs tariff as from the entry into force of this Regulation and for the same transitional period, so as to ensure the complete integration of the  Canary Islands into the customs union by 31 December 2000;
Whereas, however, as regards products coming under the common agricultural policy, application of the Common Customs Tariff and other import duties is dependent on the entry into force of the specific measures to supply the Canary Islands with essential  agricultural products; whereas at all events the gradual application of the Common Customs Tariff to the Canary Islands may be accompanied, where appropriate, by specific tariff measures or derogations from the common commercial policy for certain  sensitive products; whereas such measures may also be taken in respect of the arrangements applicable to free zones;
Whereas the charge known as the 'arbitrio insular - tarifa especial' applicable to products supplied by other parts of the Community on the terms set out in Article 6 (3) of Protocol 2 shall not be extended beyond 31 December 1992 except as applied on a  case-by-case basis, until 31 December 2000 at the latest, to be decided upon by the Council; whereas the levying of this charge on products imported into the Canary Islands from non-Community countries will have to be phased out from 1 January 1996 so  that it is completely eliminated by 31 December 2000, without prejudice to obligations under existing arrangements;

Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to those provisions (1),
Whereas:
I.   PROCEDURE
(1) By letter of 18 October 2005 the Italian authorities notified the Commission of the above aid scheme. They provided the Commission with further information by letters of 20 December 2005, 13 March 2006 and 27 March 2006. The Commission requested additional information by letters of 10 November 2005 and 8 February 2006.
(2) By letter of 16 May 2006, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid measure.
(3) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2). The Commission called on interested parties to submit their comments.
(4) Italy submitted its comments by letter of 23 June 2006, in which it announced its intention to submit further observations on a specific aspect.
(5) No interested parties submitted comments during the procedure.
(6) The Commission asked for supplementary information by letters of 21 September 2006 and 10 January 2007.
(7) By letter of 30 January 2007, registered as received by the Commission on 2 February 2007, Italy informed the Commission that the notified measure had been withdrawn.
II.   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE MEASURE
(8) The objective of the measure was to promote the growth of small and micro enterprises resulted from an aggregation process (merger with or acquisition of other small and micro enterprises) by means of a tax credit. The budget foreseen for the notified measure was EUR 120 million for 2006, EUR 242 million for 2007 and EUR 122 million for 2008.
(9) The legal basis of the measure is Article 2 of Decree Law No 106 of 17 June 2005, converted into Law No 156 of 31 July 2005. It contains a standstill clause. The aid scheme has not been put in place.
(10) Italy already enacted a similar measure in 2005 (3) under the Block Exemption Regulation for aid to SMEs (4). That version limits the tax credit to 50 % of the consultancy costs for the merger and acquisition process. The Italian authorities have indicated that, given this ceiling, the take-up of the measure has been limited, with 132 applications for a total tax credit of EUR 3 442 261. Only 46 applications were accepted for a total amount of tax credit of EUR 415 306.
III.   COMMENTS FROM ITALY
(11) By letter of 30 January 2007, the Italian authorities informed the Commission that the budget for this measure has been used for other purposes and that the notified measure had not been implemented as it had been withdrawn.
IV.   ASSESSMENT
(12) Following the withdrawal of the notification, the procedure no longer has any relevance.
V.   CONCLUSION
(13) The Commission has therefore decided to close the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty on the ground that it no longer has any relevance following the withdrawal of the measure by Italy,","{'header': '16.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 128/43', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 21 March 2007\non State aid scheme C 18/2006 (ex N 524/2005) (which Italy was planning to implement for small and micro enterprises)\n(notified under document number C(2007) 1175)\n(Only the Italian version is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/335/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAfter the withdrawal by Italy of the notified measure, the present procedure no longer has any relevance.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 5, 92 and 93 thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement establishing the European Economic Area, and in particular Articles 61 and 62 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 18 December 1991 the Commission took the decision to open a procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the EC Treaty with respect to various State aid projects for the benefit of the VW Group in Thüringen and Sachsen (1). By letter dated 29 January 1992, Germany agreed to suspend further payments of aid until the closure of the Article 93 (2) procedure.
According to the Commission's information the total aid paid illegally to VW in the form of grants allegedly for the projects Mosel II and Chemnitz II in October and December 1991 amounts to DM 360.8 million (ECU 191,2 million). Furthermore, VW Sachsen has obtained corporation tax refunds to the amount of DM 11,4 million (ECU 6,1 million) and special depreciation on its investments in 1991, where the amount still remains to be determined.
(2) On 27 July 1994 the Commission took a final decision within that procedure on the restructuring aid to Sächsische Automobilbau GmbH for its car end engine plants in Mosel (Mosel I) and Chemnitz (Chemnitz I) and the cylinder head plant in Eisenach.
At the time of this final decision Germany informed the Commission that the VW Group would finalize its plans on its new investment projects in Mosel and Chemnitz (Mosel II and Chemnitz II) at the end of 1994, so that at that time the relevant information on these projects would be transmitted to the Commission in order for it to assess the proposed regional aid. Before the final decision on the restructuring aid in 1994, the revised plans of VW were presented to the Commission in a preliminary form. The plant layout was to be changed and the investment would only start at the end of 1994. Furthermore, the aid contracts had been revised, so that the grants were reduced to DM 646,8 million for Mosel II and to DM 167,3 million for Chemnitz II. The corporation tax refunds would also fall to DM 106,8 million for Mosel II and to DM 31,9 million for Chemnitz II. This is due to the fact that eligible investment in Mosel II has been reduced to DM 2 812,9 million and to DM 758,8 million in Chemnitz, while projected employment fell to 2 843 in Mosel II and 786 in Chemnitz.
(3) At the end of 1994, as well as in the following months, Germany informed the Commission that the investment plans by VW had not been finalized.
(4) By letter dated 12 April 1995 the Commission requested Germany to provide VW's plans for the new plants. No reply was received to that letter.
(5) By letter dated 4 August 1995, the Commission urgently requested the necessary information, threatening an injunction and eventually a final decision on the basis of the available information in case of non-compliance. In reaction to this letter the German Government informed the Commission by letter dated 22 August 1995 that VW's investment plans were still not finalized. It also stated that under German law a reimbursement of aid would be necessary if VW did not fully execute its investment or employment plans.
(6) Under these conditions the Commission concludes that Germany has not submitted the necessary information for the Commission to assess the compatibility of the State aid to the VW Group for its projects Mosel II and Chemnitz II with Article 92 of the EC Treaty. Of this aid, grants to the amount of DM 360,8 million (ECU 191,2 million), corporation tax refunds to the amount of DM 11,4 million (ECU 6,1 million) and special depreciation on its investments in 1991, where the amount still remains to be determined, have already been paid. The fact that the aid or part of it might have to be reimbursed under German law, if the company did not fully execute its investment or employment plans, is not relevant for the assessment of the compatibility of the aid.
(7) In view of the above, and as the Court of Justice has acknowledged in its judgment of 14 February 1990 in Case C-301/87 (France v. Commission) and later confirmed in its judgment of 13 April 1994 in Joined Cases C-324/90 and C-342/90 (2), where an infringement of Article 93 (3) of the EC Treaty has been committed, the Commission is entitled to take an interim decision requiring the Member State in question, in this case Germany, to suspend payment of the aid and to provide the Commission with all the documents, information and particulars necessary for examining the compatibility of the aid measures with the common market. The Commission takes note that in reaction to the opening of procedure Germany has confirmed by letter dated 29 January 1992 that it would suspend payment of the aid.
Furthermore, pursuant to existing case law, should Germany fail to comply with this Decision by not providing all relevant information for the assessment of the compatibility of the abovementioned aid within the deadline of six weeks of the notification of this Decision, the Commission could take a final decision on the basis of the currently available information. Such final decision could include a demand for reimbursement of the aid including interest charged on the amount of aid paid to the company concerned from the date of payment at the percentage value on that date of the reference rate used for the calculation of the net grant equivalent of the various types of aid in that Member State. Such a measure would be necessary in order to restore the status quo (3) by removing all of the financial benefit that has been improperly enjoyed by the recipient of illegal aid since the date that it received the aid,","{'title': '96/179/EC: Commission Decision of 31 October 1995 enjoining the German Government to provide all documentation, information and data on the new investment projects of the Volkswagen Group in the new German Länder and on the aid that is to be granted to them (C 62/91 ex NN 75, 77, 78 and 79/91) (Only the German text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nGermany shall, within six weeks of the notification of this Decision, provide all appropriate information, documentation and data allowing the Commission to assess the compatibility with Article 92 of the EC Treaty of the aid to the Volkswagen Group for its investment in the Mosel II and Chemnitz II plants in the new Länder of Germany.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Articles 13(2) and 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply to active substances for which completeness has been established in accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 (3), with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval. 1-Naphthylacetamide is an active substance for which completeness has been established in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Regulations (EC) No 1112/2002 (4) and (EC) No 2229/2004 (5) lay down the detailed rules for the implementation of the fourth stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and establish a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list included 1-naphthylacetamide.
(3) In accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report referred to in Article 24(2) of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/941/EC of 8 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances (6) was adopted on the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetamide.
(4) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex I.
(5) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/941/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.
(6) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 12 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on 1-naphthylacetamide to the Commission on 15 February 2011 (7). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for 1-naphthylacetamide.
(7) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetamide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve 1-naphthylacetamide in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.
(9) Without prejudice to the conclusion that 1-naphthylacetamide should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.
(10) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.
(11) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetamide. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(12) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (8) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(13) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (9) should be amended accordingly.
(14) Decision 2008/941/EC provides for the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetamide and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011. It is necessary to delete the line concerning 1-naphthylacetamide in the Annex to that Decision. It is therefore appropriate to amend Decision 2008/941/EC accordingly.

That list included 1-naphthylacetamide.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 24e of Regulation (EC) No\xa02229/2004 the notifier withdrew its support of the inclusion of that active substance in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC within 2 months from receipt of the draft assessment report referred to in Article 24(2) of that Regulation. Consequently, Commission Decision 2008/941/EC of 8 December 2008 concerning the non-inclusion of certain active substances in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing these substances(6)was adopted on the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetamide.\n\n((4)) Pursuant to Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the original notifier (hereinafter ‘the applicant’) submitted a new application requesting the accelerated procedure to be applied, as provided for in Articles 14 to 19 of Regulation (EC) No\xa033/2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Directive 91/414/EEC as regards a regular and an accelerated procedure for the assessment of active substances which were part of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of that Directive but have not been included into its Annex\xa0I.\n\n((5)) The application was submitted to France, which had been designated rapporteur Member State by Regulation (EC) No 2229/2004. The time period for the accelerated procedure was respected. The specification of the active substance and the supported uses are the same as were the subject of Decision 2008/941/EC. That application also complies with the remaining substantive and procedural requirements of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008.\n\n((6)) France evaluated the additional data submitted by the applicant and prepared an additional report. It communicated that report to the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’) and to the Commission on 12 March 2010. The Authority communicated the additional report to the other Member States and the applicant for comments and forwarded the comments it had received to the Commission. In accordance with Article 20(1) of Regulation (EC) No 33/2008 and at the request of the Commission, the Authority presented its conclusion on 1-naphthylacetamide to the Commission on 15 February 2011(7). The draft assessment report, the additional report and the conclusion of the Authority were reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and finalised on 17 June 2011 in the format of the Commission review report for 1-naphthylacetamide.\n\n((7)) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetamide may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular as regards the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve 1-naphthylacetamide in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\n\n((8)) In accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, in conjunction with Article 6 thereof and in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, it is, however, necessary to include certain conditions and restrictions.\n\n((9)) Without prejudice to the conclusion that 1-naphthylacetamide should be approved, it is, in particular, appropriate to require further confirmatory information.\n\n((10)) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before approval in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the approval.\n\n((11)) Without prejudice to the obligations defined by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of the approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of 6 months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing 1-naphthylacetamide. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw existing authorisations. By way of derogation from the above deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.\n\n((12)) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(8)has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.\n\n((13)) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances(9)should be amended accordingly.\n\n((14)) Decision 2008/941/EC provides for the non-inclusion of 1-naphthylacetamide and the withdrawal of authorisations for plants protection products containing that substance by 31 December 2011.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3768/85 (2), and in particular Articles 40 and 41a (4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 41a (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 provides that alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Article 41 of that Regulation shall be disposed of either by public auction or by a tendering procedure; whereas, since this procedure is such as to permit products to be disposed of without discrimination among Community buyers and to ensure a level of prices that does not hinder the normal development of prices on the market, it would seem appropriate also for the disposal of alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 39 and 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79;
Whereas Articles 40a and 41a of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 provide that the disposal of products obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 39, 40 and 41 held by the intervention agencies must take place in such a way as to avoid any disturbance of the markets in alcohol and spirituous beverages; whereas, consistent with this objective, it is necessary to fix minimum selling prices for alcohol intended for those markets taking account of representative market prices for grain alcohol of comparable quality and the effective disposal price for wine alcohol from voluntary distillations, and to set aside certain quantities of alcohol for other sectors, in particular, for use as motor fuel or fuel in thermal power stations; whereas the legal and administrative obstacles to the use of alcohol in this latter sector which have existed hitherto must be eliminated in accordance with Council Directive 85/536/EEC of 5 December 1985 on crude oil savings through the use of substitute fuel components in petrol (3);
Whereas in order to ensure compliance with Article 40a of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79, provision should be made for alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 39 and 40 of that Regulation to be put up for sale firstly on the market in alcohol and spirituous beverages and to be assigned to other sectors only if such putting up for sale has not produced results;
Whereas it would seem appropriate to provide that the procedures for selling products obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 39 and 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 on the market in alcohol and spirituous beverages be opened and administered by the Member States' intervention agencies; whereas, however, since the disposal of this alcohol in other sectors and the disposal of alcohol obtained from the distillation operations provided for in Article 41 are wholly the responsibility of the EAGGF, they must be carried out under procedures opened and administered at Community level;
Whereas, in order to avoid any disturbance of the various markets in alcohol while affording operators some guidance, it would seem appropriate to provide for the fixing of minimum prices before the beginning of each marketing year; whereas it must, however, be possible for these prices to be altered if the economic situation has significantly altered the terms of reference;
Whereas the period of application of this Regulation should be limited, as of now, to one year in order to enable some degree of experience to be gained and to enable a decision on measures to be taken, and subsequently to be made on the basis of that experience,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 139/86 of 20 January 1986 laying down general rules for the disposal of alcohol obtained from the distillation operations referred to in Articles 39, 40 and 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 and held by intervention agencies', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provides for the approval of the national scrapie control programmes of the Member States if they comply with certain criteria laid down in that Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 also provides for the definition of any additional guarantees which may be required for intra-Community trade and imports in accordance with that Regulation.
(2) Commission Decision 2003/100/EC of 13 February 2003 laying down minimum requirements for the establishment of breeding programmes for resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in sheep (2), provides that each Member State is to introduce a breeding programme to select for resistance to TSEs in certain sheep breeds. That Decision also provides for the possibility for a Member State to derogate from the requirement to establish a breeding programme on the basis of its national scrapie control programme, submitted and approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, where it provides for the continuous active monitoring of dead-on-farm ovine and caprine animals in all flocks in that Member State.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1874/2003 of 24 October 2003 approving the national scrapie control programmes of certain Member States and defining additional guarantees, and granting derogations concerning breeding programmes for TSE resistance in sheep pursuant to Decision 2003/100/EC (3), approved the national scrapie control programmes of Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
(4) On 18 November 2005, Austria submitted a national scrapie control programme to the Commission. On 5 January 2006, certain amendments to that programme were submitted to the Commission. That programme, as amended, meets the required criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. In addition, Austria is likely to have a low prevalence or absence of scrapie on its territory.
(5) On the basis of that national scrapie control programme, Austria should be granted derogation from the breeding programme provided for in Decision 2003/100/EC. Furthermore, the additional trade guarantees required by Annex VIII, Chapter A and Annex IX, Chapter E to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be laid down in the present Regulation.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1874/2003 provides for certain additional guarantees for Denmark, Finland and Sweden relating to holdings. Those additional trade guarantees should, however, be amended in order to increase subsidiarity to those Member States and also Austria, taking into account different epidemiological and trade situations and differences in scrapie strains present in those four Member States.
(7) Therefore, for practical reasons and in the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to repeal Regulation (EC) No 1874/2003 and replace it by the present Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(5). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

(3) Candidatures have been examined with a view to appointing seven new members of the Management Board on the basis of the documentation provided by the Commission and in the light of the views expressed by the European Parliament. The aim is to secure the highest standard of competence, a broad range of relevant expertise, for instance in management and in public administration, and the broadest possible geographic distribution within the Union.
(4) Three of the current EFSA Management Board members have a background in organisations representing consumers and other interests in the food chain, therefore, at least one of the new members of the EFSA Management Board should still have such a background,",{'header': '30.6.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 171/3'}

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 520/94 of 7 March 1994 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 138/96(2), and in particular Articles 9 and 13 thereof,
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001 of 9 July 2001 establishing administration procedures for the 2002 quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China(3), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001 established the portion of each of the quotas concerned reserved for traditional and other importers and the conditions and methods for participating in the allocation of the quantities available. Importers have lodged applications for import licences with the competent national authorities between 11 July and 3 p.m., Brussels time, on 7 September, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001.
(2) The Commission has received from the Member States, pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001, particulars of the numbers and aggregate volume of import licence applications submitted and the total volume imported by traditional importers in 1998 or 1999, the reference years.
(3) The Commission is now able, on the basis of that information, to establish uniform quantitative criteria by which the competent national authorities may satisfy licence applications submitted by importers in the Member States for the 2002 quantitative quotas.
(4) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by traditional importers for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction/increase shown in Annex I to the volume of each importer's imports, expressed in quantity or value terms, over the reference period.
(5) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex II to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 1995/2001 of 11 October 2001 establishing the quantities to be allocated to importers from the 2002 Community quantitative quotas on certain products originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex I duly submitted by traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity or value equal to his imports for 1998 or 1999, as indicated by the importer, adjusted by the rate of reduction/increase specified in the said Annex for each quota.\n\nWhere the use of this quantitative criterion would entail allocating an amount greater than that applied for, the quantity or value allocated shall be limited to that specified in the application.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nIn response to licence applications in respect of the products listed in Annex II duly submitted by non-traditional importers, the competent national authorities shall allocate each importer a quantity or value equal to the amount requested within the limits set by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001, adjusted by the rate of reduction specified in the said Annex for each quota.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 11 October 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 66, 10.3.1994, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 21, 27.1.1996, p. 6.\n\n(3) OJ L 187, 10.7.2001, p. 31.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_I', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX I', 'text': 'ANNEX I\n\nRate of reduction/increase applicable to imports in 1998 or 1999\n\n(traditional importers)\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': 'anx_II', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX II', 'text': 'ANNEX II\n\nRate of reduction applicable to the volume requested within the limits of the maximum amounts fixed by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2001\n\n(non-traditional importers)\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
