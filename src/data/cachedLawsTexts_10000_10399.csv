(3) A minimum price for sugar cane should be set which takes into account the reference price for sugar cane intended for the production of sugar applicable in the department in question and provision should also be made for a system to reduce, where appropriate, the quantities of rum or sucrose syrup eligible for aid so as to ensure that the overall quantity limit laid down by Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1452/2001 is observed.
(4) Sucrose syrup, which is not sugar production within the meaning of Articles 13 to 18 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001(4), should be defined.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(4). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1980/2002 of 7 November 2002 fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for molasses in the sugar sector', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe representative prices and the additional duties applying to imports of the products referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 are fixed in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 8 November 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 7 November 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

Whereas, pursuant to Article 23 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, reference prices valid for the whole Community are to be fixed at the beginning of the marketing year;
Whereas broad-leaved (Batavian) endives (Cichorium endivia L. var. latifolia) are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas endives harvested during a given crop year are marketed from July to June of the following year; whereas the quantities imported from 1 July to 14 November and from 1 April to 30 June of the following year are so small that there is no need to  fix reference prices for these periods; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 15 November up to and including 31 March of the following year;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:
- the increase in production costs for fruit and vegetables, less productivity growth, and
- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal price variations into account, the marketing year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EU) No 642/2010 of 20 July 2010 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 in respect of import duties in the cereals sector (2), and in particular Article 2(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 136(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 states that the import duty on products covered by CN codes 1001 19 00, 1001 11 00, ex 1001 91 20 (common wheat seed), ex 1001 99 00 (high quality common wheat other than for sowing), 1002 10 00, 1002 90 00, 1005 10 90, 1005 90 00, 1007 10 90 and 1007 90 00 is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55 %, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question. However, that duty may not exceed the rate of duty in the Common Customs Tariff.
(2) Article 136(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 lays down that, in order to calculate the import duty referred to in paragraph 1 of that Article, representative cif import prices are to be established on a regular basis for the products in question.
(3) Under Article 2(2) of Regulation (EU) No 642/2010, the price to be used for the calculation of the import duty on products covered by CN codes 1001 19 00, 1001 11 00, ex 1001 91 20 (common wheat seed), ex 1001 99 00 (high quality common wheat other than for sowing), 1002 10 00, 1002 90 00, 1005 10 90, 1005 90 00, 1007 10 90 and 1007 90 00 is the daily cif representative import price determined as specified in Article 5 of that Regulation.
(4) Import duties should be fixed for the period from 16 July 2012 and should apply until new import duties are fixed and enter into force.
(5) Given the need to ensure that this measure applies as soon as possible after the updated data have been made available, this Regulation should enter into force on the day of its publication,","{'header': '14.7.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 186/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 639/2012\nof 13 July 2012\nfixing the import duties in the cereals sector applicable from 16 July 2012', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 136(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 states that the import duty on products covered by CN codes 1001\xa019\xa000, 1001\xa011\xa000, ex\xa01001\xa091\xa020 (common wheat seed), ex\xa01001\xa099\xa000 (high quality common wheat other than for sowing), 1002\xa010\xa000, 1002\xa090\xa000, 1005\xa010\xa090, 1005\xa090\xa000, 1007\xa010\xa090 and 1007\xa090\xa000 is to be equal to the intervention price valid for such products on importation and increased by 55\xa0%, minus the cif import price applicable to the consignment in question.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 of 19 January 1976 on the common organization of the market fishery products (1), and in particular Article 2 (3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 provides that common marketing standards may be laid down ; whereas the application of such standards should help to improve the quality of shrimps marketed and thus facilitate their sale;
Whereas one way of improving quality is to prohibit the marketing for human consumption of shrimps which are not of a given degree of freshness or of a given size;
Whereas virtually all Community shrimps are boiled in water immediately after being caught to prevent any deterioration in their freshness ; whereas it is therefore advisable as a first priority to lay down standards for shrimps simply boiled in water;
Whereas, in almost all Member States engaged in sea fishing, shrimps which have been adjudged fit for human consumption under national regulations are offered for sale after grading by size ; whereas shrimps are also graded according to degree of freshness;
Whereas the adoption of standards for shrimps has assumed particular importance in view of the measures on the determination and formation of prices provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 100/76 ; whereas the grading hitherto carried out at national level should therefore be standardized;
Whereas shrimps have hitherto been graded only before being sold for the first time, since a large proportion of such shrimps is immediately shelled or otherwise processed ; whereas application of common standards should therefore be limited to the first marketing stage in the Community;
Whereas the standards must apply to all shrimps intended for human consumption, including imported shrimps, marketed on the territory of the Member States of the Community ; whereas the limitation of the obligation incumbent on the industry to shrimps intended for human consumption enables a clearer and more rapid distinction to be made between products which are permitted for human consumption and which, being used for that purpose, are therefore subject to grading, and other products ; whereas this will facilitate both marketing at the stage where standards are applied and the checking of compliance with these standards ; whereas it seems necessary, however, to exclude from the field of application of the standards certain direct sales of small quantities to retailers or consumers;
Whereas freshness is a decisive factor in assessing the quality of shrimps ; whereas grading by size is also essential because of the diversity of consumers' buying habits and the processing methods normally used in the Community;
Whereas there is at present no objective method of assessing the freshness of shrimps both rapidly and cheaply ; whereas only organoleptic examination, which is, moreover, in use in the Member States, meets this requirement and constitutes an acceptable method;
Whereas, in view of normal practice in most Member States, it is advisable that the industry should grade shrimps for freshness and size ; whereas, with a view in particular to assessing freshness by organoleptic criteria, provision should be made for the collaboration of experts appointed for this purpose by the trade organizations concerned;
(1) See page 1 of this Official Journal.  Whereas, in order to keep each other informed, each Member State should supply the other Member States and the Commission with a list of the names and addresses of the experts and trade organizations concerned;
Whereas it is essential that shrimps imported from third countries should conform to Community standards;
Whereas the application of Community standards to these shrimps means that additional information must be given on packages ; whereas, however, this information is not necessary in the case of shrimps landed in the Community direct from the fishing grounds from third country vessels, it being understood, however, that such shrimps may be marketed only in accordance with the provisions applicable to Community catches,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 104/76 of 19 January 1976 laying down common marketing standards for shrimps of the genus ""Crangon"" sp.p.', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nMarketing standards are hereby laid down for shrimps of the genus ""Crangon"" sp.p., simply boiled in water, falling within subheading ex 03.03 A IV b) 1 of the Common Customs Tariff.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nFor the purpose of this Regulation:    (a) ""marketing"" means the first offering for sale and the first sale after arrival in the Community;\n\n(b) ""lot"" means a quantity of shrimps packed as a unit;\n\n(c) ""packaging"" means the type of container in which the shrimps are offered for sale, such as boxes, baskets, etc.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

(1) Article 9(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2362/98 lays down the method for calculating the annual allocation for each newcomer operator. In accordance with that method and on the basis of the individual applications ranked in ascending order of quantities applied for, the Commission is to determine the quantities for which the annual allocations are to be granted.
(2) In the light of the notifications received from the Member States pursuant to Article 2(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2374/2000 of 26 October 2000 on imports of bananas under the tariff quotas and of traditional ACP bananas for 2001(5), the Commission needs to adopt the measures laid down herein, to serve as a basis for the competent national authorities to determine the individual allocations for the operators concerned and to notify the latter accordingly.
(3) However, the amendments to the Community banana import arrangements introduced by Regulation (EC) No 2362/98, and in particular the provisions defining newcomer operators, require the competent national authorities in cooperation with the Commission to conduct checks and verifications, which may not be completed before the beginning of 2001. The findings may result in further amendments to this Regulation and to adjustments to the annual allocations for the newcomer operators. Accordingly, the annual allocations determined by the national authorities pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2374/2000 do not constitute vested rights, nor can they be invoked by operators as constituting grounds for legitimate expectations.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 6 August 1990 concerning applications for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on the import of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (Gantrade (UK) Ltd) (90/460/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A.  PROCEDURE
(1)
By Regulation (EEC) No 2357/87 (2), the Council amended Regulation (EEC) No 1282/81, imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States of America (3). Anti-dumping duty of 6 % was applied to the  American company Gantrade Corporation.
(2)
Since November 1987 Gantrade (UK) Ltd, a European subsidiary of Gantrade Corporation, based in Bishop's Stortford, United Kingdom, has been submitting periodic applications for refund of anti-dumping duties paid on imports of vinyl acetate monomer  exported by Gantrade Corporation.
The Commission, with the agreement of the applicant, decided to treat the applications as recurring applications within the meaning of
point 1.4 of the Commission notice concerning the reimbursement of anti-dumping duties (hereinafter referred to as 'the notice') (4). Accordingly, the applicant has submitted successive applications, within the three-month time limit set out under
Article 16
(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The information required to assess the merits of the applications has been provided at six-monthly intervals.
(3)
In November 1988 the Commission received a request lodged by an American producer/exporter for a
review of the the anti-dumping measures applicable
to imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in
the United States of America. On 25 April 1989 the Commission opened the review proceeding covering the period October 1988 to March 1989 inclusive (5). In accordance with point 1.5 of the notice, it was decided that the proceeding regarding the  application for reimbursement opened at the request of Gantrade (UK) Ltd would be suspended until termination of the review. However, the applicant continued to submit periodic applications. Council Regulation (EEC) No 490/90 repealed Regulation (EEC)  No 2357/87 and terminated the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating in the United States (6). Thus, since 2 March 1990, anti-dumping duty can no longer be imposed on imports of vinyl acetate monomer originating  in the United States.
(4)
So as not to delay the decision on refunds, it was decided to process immediately the applications concerning imports made up to March 1989. These applications were examined at the applicant's headquarters. Recurring applications submitted after this  date, or which might still be submitted, covering periods up to 1 March 1990 - when the duty ceased to be applicable - will be covered by a further Decision.
(5)
The total amount of refunds requested was Bfrs (. . .) (7), which represents all the duty paid.
(6)
The applicant was informed of the results of the examination and had the opportunity to submit its comments.
(7)
Pursuant to Article 16 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, the Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the applications' admissibility and merits. No Member State raised any objection.
B.  ARGUMENT OF THE APPLICANT
(8)
Gantrade (UK) Ltd argued that the imports in question were not dumped.
C.  ADMISSIBILITY
(9)
The applicant duly submitted its first request for refund on 20 November 1987 in respect of anti-
dumping duties determined between June and September 1987. Pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, applications for refund of anti-dumping duties are admissible if they are submitted within three months of the date on which the  anti-dumping duties were duly determined. The first application by Gantrade UK Ltd is, therefore, admissible only in part namely in respect of duties determined since 20 August 1987. Thus the refunds requested should be reduced by Bfrs (. . .),  corresponding to the duties determined before that date. The remaining recurring applications are admissible in that they were lodged in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislation, in particular with regard to  time limits.
D.  MERITS OF THE CLAIM
(10)
All the applications examined, covering the period
20 August 1987 to end of March 1989 appear to be well founded. Indeed, the applicant, in accordance with the provisions of Article 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88, supplied evidence that the actual dumping margin had been eliminated by the time the  imports in question were made. The Commission was able to verify all the information supplied and found it to be complete and satisfactory. It was decided to calculate the dumping margin using the method that had been used during the first  investigation. Given that the applicant is a subsidiary of the exporter, the provisions of point 11.2 (c) of the notice were applied, namely all costs incurred between importation and resale, including the anti-dumping duties paid, were deducted from  the resale price to the first independent buyers. It was found that the dumping margin was
nil. This development was due to substantial modifications in export prices resulting from significant changes in market conditions worldwide for the product imported.
Accordingly, the applications for refund of anti-dumping duties submitted by Gantrade (UK)
Ltd for vinyl acetate monomer imported between
20 August 1987 and March 1989 inclusive and considered admissible should be granted.
E.  AMOUNT TO BE REIMBURSED

Whereas on 3 August 1992 France forwarded a 'framework' regionalization plan to the Commission pursuant to Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92;
Whereas an examination of the abovementioned plan shows that oilseeds are treated separately from other arable crops as a result of a specific regionalization approach carrying over the previous system;
Whereas cereals yields are calculated by means of a special equalization formula differing from that for determining compensatory payments;
Whereas, however, treating oilseeds in the same way as other arable crops could lead to difficulties for oilseeds when applied too inflexibly; whereas the unmodulated application of the criteria laid down for calculating the cereal yields in Regulation  (EEC) No 1765/92 is likely to cause considerable difficulties as regards the income of producers in French regions with lower yields; whereas provision should therefore be made for a transitional period to facilitate the switchover from the system  previously applicable to oilseeds to that provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 and to permit the necessary adjustments in regions with lower yields;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82, (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83 (1), introduced certain quantitative quotas, listed in  Annex II to that Regulation, applicable to the People's Republic of China;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 2 of the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, these quotas are applicable to the acceding countries, subject to and on the date of the entry into force of the Treaty concerning the accession of those  acceding countries; whereas in accordance with Article 169 of the Act of Accession, the Community institutions may make the necessary adaptations to Community acts which have not been provided for in that Act;
Whereas the Council, in determining the level of the quotas referred to above, endeavoured to strike a balance between adequate protection of the Community industries concerned and the need to preserve traditional trade flows with the People's Republic  of China, bearing in mind the various interests of the parties concerned;
Whereas, in the context of accession, that balance should be preserved by ensuring continuity in the acceding countries' traditional trade flows for the products concerned, without prejudice to the protection of the Community industry;
Whereas, to that end, it should be borne in mind that imports of the products concerned have developed in each of the acceding countries without the constraints imposed by quantitative restrictions; whereas imports recorded in 1993 - the most recent  year for which full statistical records are available - may be considered as being representative of the pattern of traditional trade;
Whereas in these circumstances, the levels of quotas established on an annual basis pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 519/94 should be adjusted by additional of the quantities shown in the Annex to this Regulation, which are equivalent to imports recorded  in 1993;
Whereas, in addition, the experience gained in applying and administering the 1994 quotas together with a review of the situation of the various Community producers based on available data concerning the main economic indicators, and in particular  production, exports, imports, consumption and employment levels, suggest that some of these quotas could be increased and that the quota for gloves falling within CN code 4203 29 10 could be abolished; whereas such increases may be introduced while  guaranteeing the necessary level of protection for the Community industry and ensuring a more appropriate volume of trade with China; whereas the same does not hold in respect of quotas imposed on footwear, which should not be increased beyond the  quantities required by reason of the accession of the new Member States;
Whereas, however, Regulation (EC) No 519/94 had excluded from the application of any quantitative restrictions certain sports footwear involving special technology; whereas in-depth analysis of the sector shows that the range of such footwear may be  freely imported without causing prejudice to the Community industry can be expanded; whereas the quotas covering the products falling within CN codes ex 6402 19 and ex 6403 19 should be abolished and the mention of the cif price condition appearing in  the definition of the footwear involving special technology should be modified;
Whereas, therefore, the quantitative quotas introduced by Regulation (EC) No 519/94 should be modified as shown in the Annex to this Regulation;
Whereas the products in respect of which quotas are abolished by this Regulation should, however, be subject to prior Community surveillance;
Whereas Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 519/94 should therefore be amended to take account, inter alia, of certain amendments made to the combined nomenclature;
Whereas quotas should not apply to products en route for one of the acceding countries on 31 December 1994 where their destination cannot be changed,","{'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 538/95 of 6 March 1995 amending Regulation (EC) No 519/94 on common rules for imports from certain third countries', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex II to Regulation (EC) No 519/94 shall be replaced by the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThe following amendments shall be made to Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 519/94:\n\n1.

After consulting the Scientific Committee for Food on the provisions liable to affect public health;

Whereas the diverse culinary habits in the Community have resulted in the marketing of sauces used as accompaniment to a meal which are organoleptically important but not significant in nutrient contribution; whereas therefore these sauces should be exempt from the protein requirements in Annex II;

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 517/94 establishes the annual quantitative limits for certain textile products originating in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
(2) Following the political changes in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in October 2000, that country is now a full participant in the EU's Stabilisation and Association process and is a full beneficiary of the Community's preferential trade regime with the countries of the Western Balkans established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2563/2000(4).
(3) A mandate for the negotiation of a bilateral agreement in trade in textiles cannot yet be considered since issues relating to foreign trade and customs control within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have still to be resolved.
(4) Trade in certain categories of textile products is presently blocked because the quotas have been exhausted. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has requested a 20 % increase in those quotas.
(5) It is appropriate to increase the levels of all quotas for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, as was done for Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the year 2000 by Council Regulation (EC) No 7/2000(5) prior to the negotiation of bilateral textile agreements with those two countries.
(6) The starting point for determining that increase should be the quota growth rate per category which was foreseen in a Supplementary Protocol to the Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on trade in textile products, concluded by Council Decision 90/649/EEC(6).
(7) That across-the-board increase should be redistributed to the categories most needed, up to the limits of the increases requested by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
(8) The increased quota levels should apply from the beginning of the year 2001 in order to absorb certain pending import requests.

THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), and in particular Article 47 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 47 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that central banks of Member States with a derogation (hereinafter ‘non-euro area NCBs’) do not need to pay up their subscribed capital unless the General Council, acting by a majority representing at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) and at least half of the shareholders, decides that a minimal percentage has to be paid up as a contribution to the ECB’s operational costs.
(2) Article 1 of Decision ECB/2008/28 of 15 December 2008 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the non-participating national central banks (1) provides that non-euro area NCBs must pay up 7 % of their subscription to the ECB’s capital with effect from 1 January 2009.
(3) Decision ECB/2008/23 of 12 December 2008 on the national central banks’ percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital (2) lays down the key for subscription to the ECB’s capital in accordance with Article 29.3 of the Statute of the ESCB and establishes with effect from 1 January 2009 the weightings assigned to each national central bank in the capital key (hereinafter the ‘capital key weightings’).
(4) Pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2010/26 of 13 December 2010 on the increase of the European Central Bank’s capital (3) the ECB’s capital has been increased by EUR 5 000 million from EUR 5 760 652 402,58 to EUR 10 760 652 402,58 with effect from 29 December 2010.
(5) The increase of the ECB’s capital would require non-euro area NCBs to pay up 7 % of their respective share in the increased capital although the ECB’s operational costs do not justify a higher contribution in absolute terms. To avoid this increased contribution to the operational costs of the ECB by the non-euro area NCBs, it is necessary to decrease the percentage that non-euro area NCBs have to pay up so that the amounts to be paid up remain on a similar level,","{'header': '15.1.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 11/56', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 13 December 2010\non the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the non-euro area national central banks\n(ECB/2010/28)\n(2011/22/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 47 of the Statute of the ESCB provides that central banks of Member States with a derogation (hereinafter ‘non-euro area NCBs’) do not need to pay up their subscribed capital unless the General Council, acting by a majority representing at least two thirds of the subscribed capital of the European Central Bank (ECB) and at least half of the shareholders, decides that a minimal percentage has to be paid up as a contribution to the ECB’s operational costs.\n\n((2)) Article 1 of Decision ECB/2008/28 of 15 December 2008 laying down the measures necessary for the paying-up of the European Central Bank’s capital by the non-participating national central banks(1)provides that non-euro area NCBs must pay up 7\xa0% of their subscription to the ECB’s capital with effect from 1 January 2009.\n\n((3)) Decision ECB/2008/23 of 12 December 2008 on the national central banks’ percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital(2)lays down the key for subscription to the ECB’s capital in accordance with Article 29.3 of the Statute of the ESCB and establishes with effect from 1 January 2009 the weightings assigned to each national central bank in the capital key (hereinafter the ‘capital key weightings’).\n\n((4)) Pursuant to Article 1 of Decision ECB/2010/26 of 13 December 2010 on the increase of the European Central Bank’s capital(3)the ECB’s capital has been increased by EUR 5\xa0000\xa0million from EUR 5\xa0760\xa0652\xa0402,58 to EUR 10\xa0760\xa0652\xa0402,58 with effect from 29 December 2010.\n\n((5)) The increase of the ECB’s capital would require non-euro area NCBs to pay up 7\xa0% of their respective share in the increased capital although the ECB’s operational costs do not justify a higher contribution in absolute terms.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1547/79 (2), and in particular Article 16 (5) thereof, and the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations on the common organization of the market in respect of agricultural products,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 441/69 of 4 March 1969 laying down additional general rules for granting export refunds on products subject to a single price system, exported unprocessed or in the form of certain goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 269/78 (4), has been amended several times ; whereas experience has shown further amendments to be desirable ; whereas, in the interests of clarity, it is desirable to consolidate the rules in question;
Whereas the Regulations laying down general rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds provide that, in order for the export refund to be paid, proof must be furnished that such products have been exported from the Community;
Whereas, in following the principle whereby a balance is ensured between the use of Community basic products with a view to exporting processed products or goods listed in Annexes B and C to Regulation (EEC) No 2682/72 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 707/78 (6), to third countries and the use of basic products from such countries admitted under inward processing arrangements pursuant to Council Directive 69/73/EEC of 4 March 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of inward processing (7), as last amended by Directive 76/119/EEC (8), an amount equal to the export refund should be paid as soon as the Community basic products, from which processed products or goods intended for export are obtained, are placed under customs control;

The standard criteria determining the eligibility of collateral for the purposes of Eurosystem monetary policy operations are laid down in Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.
(2) Pursuant to Section 1.6 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Governing Council may, at any time, change the instruments, conditions, criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations. Pursuant to Section 6.3.1 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14, the Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue, issuer, debtor or guarantor fulfils its requirements for high credit standards on the basis of any information it may consider relevant. Further, the Eurosystem's minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds are specified in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework rules for marketable assets, as laid down in Section 6.3.2 of Annex I to Guideline ECB/2011/14.
(3) The suspension of the Eurosystem's minimum requirements for credit quality thresholds applicable to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic, initially decided by the Governing Council on 6 May 2010, was an exceptional and temporary measure which was based on the positive assessment by the Governing Council of compliance with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme. At the time, the Governing Council took into consideration the fact that the Hellenic Republic had approved a programme which the Governing Council considered to be appropriate so that, from a credit risk management perspective, the marketable debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the Hellenic Republic retained a quality standard sufficient for their continued eligibility as collateral for Eurosystem monetary policy operations, irrespective of any external credit assessment. Moreover, the Governing Council took into consideration the strong commitment of the Greek Government to fully implement that programme (3).
(4) Under Article 8 of Guideline ECB/2014/31, the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds do not apply to marketable debt instruments issued or fully guaranteed by the central governments of euro area Member States under a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme, unless the Governing Council decides that the respective Member State no longer complies with the conditionality of its financial support and/or macroeconomic programme. Under Article 1(3) of the same Guideline, the Hellenic Republic is, for the purposes of Article 6(1) and Article 8 of that Guideline, considered a euro area Member State compliant with a European Union/International Monetary Fund programme.

Consequently, the Hellenic Republic is no longer deemed to be in compliance with the conditionality of the programme and, as a result, the conditions for the temporary suspension of the Eurosystem's credit quality thresholds in respect of such instruments, as set out in Article 8(2) of Guideline ECB/2014/31, are no longer fulfilled.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 130s and 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas, by its resolution of 16 September 1986 (4), the Council set new Community energy policy objectives for 1995 and convergence of the policies of the Member States;
Whereas the Council of Environment and Energy Ministers agreed at their meeting on 29 October 1990 that the Community and the Member States, assuming that other leading countries undertook similar commitments, and acknowledging the targets identified by  a number of Member States for stabilizing or reducing emissions by different dates, were willing to take actions aimed at reaching stabilization of the total carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 at the 1990 level in the Community as a whole;  whereas it was also agreed that Member States which start from relatively low levels of energy consumption and therefore low emissions measured on a per capita or other appropriate basis are entitled to have carbon dioxide targets and/or strategies  corresponding to their economic and social development, while improving the energy efficiency of their economic activities;
Whereas by Decision 91/565/EEC the Council adopted the SAVE programme aimed at promoting energy efficiency in the Community (5);
Whereas Article 130r of the Treaty stipulates that the objective of action by the Community relating to the environment shall be to ensure a prudent and rational utilization of natural resources; whereas these natural resources include oil products,  natural gas and solid fuels, which are essential sources of energy but also the leading sources of carbon dioxide emissions;
Whereas, since the Treaty has not provided elsewhere the powers required to legislate on energy-related aspects of the programmes laid down in this Directive, recourse should be had also to Article 235 of the Treaty;
Whereas the residential and tertiary sectors account for nearly 40 % of final energy consumption in the Community and are expanding, a trend which is bound to increase their energy consumption and hence also their carbon dioxide emissions;
Whereas this Directive aims to preserve the quality of the environment and to ensure a prudent and rational utilization of natural resources, which are matters of non-exclusive Community competence;
Whereas a collective effort by all Member States, implying measures at Community level, is necessary in order to limit carbon dioxide emissions and to promote the rational use of energy;
Whereas the measures are to be determined according to the principle of subsidiarity by Member States on the basis of potential improvements in energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, technical feasibility and environmental impact;
Whereas, by providing objective information on the energy characteristics of buildings, energy certification will help to improve transparency of the property market and to encourage investment in energy savings;
Whereas the billing, to occupiers of buildings, of heating, air-conditioning and hot water costs calculated, in an appropriate proportion, on the basis of actual consumption will contribute towards energy saving in the residential sector; whereas it is  desirable that occupants of such buildings should be enabled to regulate their own consumption of heat, cold and hot water; whereas the recommendations and resolutions adopted by the Council on the billing of heating and hot water costs (6) have been  applied in only two Member States; whereas a significant proportion of heating, air-conditioning and hot water costs are still being billed on the basis of factors other than energy consumption;
Whereas new methods of financial support are needed to promote investments in energy saving in the public sector; whereas, with that in mind, the Member States should permit and make full use of the possibilities offered by third-party financing;
Whereas buildings will have an impact on long-term energy consumption; whereas new buildings should therefore be fitted with efficient thermal insulation tailored to the local climate; whereas this applies also to public authority buildings where the  public authorities should set an example in taking environmental and energy considerations into account;
Whereas regular maintenance of boilers contributes to maintaining their correct adjustment in accordance with the product specification and in that way to an optimal performance from an environmental and energy point of view;
Whereas industry is generally willing to make more efficient use of energy to meet its own economic objectives; whereas energy audits in particular in undertakings with high energy consumption should be promoted to bring about significant improvements  in energy efficiency in this sector;
Whereas improving energy efficiency in all regions of the Community will strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Community, as provided for in Article 130a of the Treaty,","{'title': 'Council Directive 93/76/EEC of 13 September 1993 to limit carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency (SAVE)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe purpose of this Directive is the attainment by Member States of the objective of limiting carbon dioxide emissions by improving energy efficiency, notably by means of drawing up and implementing programmes in the following fields:\n\n- energy certification of buildings,\n\n- the billing of heating, air-conditioning and hot water costs on the basis of actual consumption,\n\n- third-party financing for energy efficiency investments in the public sector,\n\n- thermal insulation of new buildings,\n\n- regular inspection of boilers,\n\n- energy audits of undertakings with high energy consumption.\n\nProgrammes can include laws, regulations, economic and administrative instruments, information, education and voluntary agreements whose impact can be objectively assessed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nMember States shall draw up and implement programmes on the energy certification of buildings.

(3) Following a Commission mission in October 2004, subsequent follow-up and guarantees provided by Uruguay, the animal and public health situation is now satisfactory so as to allow that country to be included on the list of approved third countries set out in Annex I to Decision 2000/609/EC.
(4) In view of Uruguay’s animal health status as regards Newcastle disease, it is appropriate that imports of fresh meat of farmed ratites from Uruguay are accompanied by the model health attestation ‘A’ as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC.
(5) Decision 2000/609/EC, as amended by Decision 2004/118/EC, provides erroneously that fresh meat of farmed ratites from Australia must be accompanied by the model health attestation ‘A’ as laid down in Part 2 of Annex II to Decision 2000/609/EC, instead of the model health attestation ‘B’ laid down in that Annex.

","COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 3076/94 of 16 December 1994 introducing management measures for imports of certain bovine animals for the first half of 1995
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1157/92 of 28 April 1992 authorizing the implementation of management measure relating to imports of live bovine animals (1), and in particular Article 1 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in beef and veal (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1884/94 (3), and in particular Article 15 (2) thereof,
Whereas, as a result of production surpluses and other factors reducing outlets and in view of the potential for export to third countries, there is an imbalance between supply and demand on the Community beef and veal market; whereas an analysis of the  sector for 1995 shows that the situation is unlikely to improve significantly;
Whereas experience gained and forecasts for 1995 show that, in the absence of Community measures, massive imports into the Community of live bovine animals of up to 160 kg are likely to ocur, due, in particular to the economically favourable  stockfarming conditions existing in certain third countries; whereas such imports are likely to greatly exceed both the traditional annual level of imports and the absorption capasity of the Community market; whereas, therefore, the beef and veal market  would be threatened with serious disturbance endangering, in particular, market prices and producers' incomes and making public intervention more difficult;
Whereas, in order to take better account of market supply needs, instead of traditional protective measures such as that adopted by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1023/91 of 24 April 1991 suspending the issuing of import licences for live animals of the  bovine species (4), other appropriate management measures should be introduced in accordance with Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1157/92;
Whereas the total absorption capacity of the Community market in 1995 is estimated at a maximum of 425 000 head other than pure-bred breeding animals; whereas, in view of imports planned under certain preferential arrangements for 1995, i.e. 277 200  head in the Council estimate and under the new Uruguay Round quota concerning young male bovine animals weighing 300 kg or less and intended for fattening and under the Interim Agreements concluded with the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Hungary,  the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the Baltic Republics, 144 300 head should be admitted for import at the full levy in 1995;
Whereas the Uruguay Round Agreements are due to apply from 1 July 1995; whereas management measures should, therefore, only be adopted until that date and a quota for 50 % of the 144 300 head opened for the first half of 1995;
Whereas the Commission will closely monitor developments on the beef and veal market so as to be able to react immediately to any changes in the relevant economic criteria;
Whereas, in order to take account to the greatest possible extent of the traditional structure of the Community veal market, imports should be restricted to animals weighing 80 kg or less;
Whereas experience shows that limiting imports can give rise to speculative import applications; whereas, in order to guarantee that the planned measures function correctly, most of the quantities available should be reserved for so-called traditional  importers of live bovine animals; whereas, so as not to introduce rigidity into trade relations in the sector, a second allocation should be made available for operators able to show that they are carrying out a genuine activity involving trade in a  significant number of animals with countries which are third countries on 31 December 1994; whereas verification of those criteria requires that all applications from the same operator be submitted in the same Member State;
Whereas steps must be taken to ensure that importers in the new Member States falling within the first category can participate fairly in the allocation of the quantities available; whereas for those importers, therefore, imports from countries which  are for them third countries on 31 December 1994 of animals corresponding to those to which the quota refers carried out between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1994 should be taken into account as reference quantities giving access to the quantities  reserved for traditional importers;
Whereas, so as to avoid speculation, access to the quota should be denied to operators no longer carrying out an activity in the beef and veal sector on 1 January 1995;
Whereas the importation of 72 150 head during a single short period might excessively restrict economic freedom and would not adequately supply the market in view of the cyclical nature of market needs; whereas, therefore, different import periods  should be laid down;
Whereas administrative and technical procedures for the allocation between the eligible operators and for the issue and use of import licences must be established; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No  2746/94 (6), lays down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance-fixing certificates for agricultural products; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (7), as last amended by Regulation  (EC) No 1084/94 (8), lays down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import licences in the beef and veal sector; whereas the correct functioning of the management measures laid down by this Regulation requires derogations from  certain provisions of the abovementioned Regulations;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 3076/94 of 16 December 1994 introducing management measures for imports of certain bovine animals for the first half of 1995', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nImports into the Community, at full levy, of live bovine animals falling within CN codes 0102 90 05, 0102 90 21, 0102 90 29, 0102 90 41 and 0102 90 49, as referred to in Article 1 (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) no 805/68 shall be subject to the  management measures laid down in this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 86/362/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on cereals (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In the case of cereals and products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables, residue levels reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides necessary to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is as low as is practicable and toxicologically acceptable, having regard, in particular to the protection of the environment and the estimated dietary intake of consumers. Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected.
(2) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data.
(3) Several Member States informed the Commission of their desire to revise national MRLs in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 90/642/EEC in the light of concerns about consumer intake. Proposals for the review of Community MRLs were submitted to the Commission.

Community maximum residue levels (MRLs) represent the upper limit of the amount of such residues that might be expected to be found in commodities when good agricultural practices have been respected.\n\n((2)) MRLs for pesticides are kept under review and changed to take account of new information and data. MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported by the necessary data.\n\n((3)) Several Member States informed the Commission of their desire to revise national MRLs in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 90/642/EEC in the light of concerns about consumer intake.

opening and providing for the administration of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products originating in Cyprus, Morocco and Israel (1990)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the relevant articles of the Additional Protocols to the Agreements between the European Economic Community, on the one hand, and the Kingdom of Morocco (1) and the State of Israel (2), on the other, and the Protocol defining the conditions and procedures for the implementation of the second stage of the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Cyprus, adapting certain provisions of the Agreement (3), provide for the opening of Community tariff quotas for:
- 300 tonnes of aubergines (CN code ex 0709 30 00) originating in Cyprus (1 October to 30 November),
- 100, 450 and 100 tonnes of Chinese cabbage (CN code ex 0704 90 90) originating in Morocco, Israel and Cyprus respectively (1 November to 31 December), and
- 100, 250 and 100 tonnes of 'Iceberg' lettuce (CN codes ex 0705 11 10 and ex 0705 11 90) originating in Morocco, Israel and Cyprus respectively (1 November to 31 December).
Whereas, however, the quotas relating to Cyprus must be increased in equal steps of 5 % per annum, starting with the entry into force of the abovementioned Protocol, by virtue of its Articles 18 and 19; whereas for 1990 they will therefore be at the levels indicated in Article 1;
Whereas, under these tariff quotas, customs duties are to be abolished progressively:
- over the same periods and in accordance with the same timetables as laid down in Articles 75 and 268 of the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal in the case of the tariff quotas opened for Morocco and Israel, and
- in accordance with the timetable and conditions laid down in Articles 5 and 16 of the abovementioned Protocol and Cyprus in the case of the tariff quotas opened for Cyprus;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 4162/87 of 21 December 1987 laying down arrangements for Spain's and Portugal's trade with Israel (4), Council Regulation (EEC) No 3189/88 of 14 October 1988 laying down arrangements for Spain's and Portugal's trade with Morocco and Syria (5) and the Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Cyprus consequent on the accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic to the Community (6) provide that the Kingdom of Spain shall apply duties which progressively reduce the gap between the base duty rates and the preferential duty rates, while the Portuguese Republic is to postpone until 31 December 1990 the application of the preferential arrangements for the products in question; whereas therefore this Regulation is only applicable to the Community with the exception of Portugal;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure equal and uninterrupted access for all Community importers to the abovementioned quotas and uninterrupted application of the rates laid down for those quotas to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quotas have been used up; whereas it would appear advisable not to allocate the quotas among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volumes of such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to the procedures specified in Article 3; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission;

of 13 December 2010
on the issue of euro banknotes
(recast)
(ECB/2010/29)
(2011/67/EU)
THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 128(1) thereof,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter the ‘Statute of the ESCB’), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 128(1) of the Treaty and Article 16 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes within the Union. Under these provisions, the ECB and the NCBs may issue euro banknotes which are the only banknotes to have the status of legal tender within the Member States whose currency is the euro. Union law has foreseen a system of a plurality of issuers of banknotes. The ECB and the NCBs issue euro banknotes.
(2) Pursuant to Article 10 of Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro (1), on 1 January 2002, the ECB and the NCBs put into circulation banknotes denominated in euro. Euro banknotes are expressions of the same and single currency, and subject to a single legal regime.
(3) The issue of euro banknotes need not be subject to quantitative or other limits, since putting banknotes into circulation is a demand driven process.
(4) Decision ECB/2003/4 of 20 March 2003 on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of euro banknotes (2) contains common rules on euro banknotes. The ECB has established common technical specifications for euro banknotes and quality control measures to ensure that they comply with such specifications. As a consequence, all euro banknotes have the same physical appearance and level of quality and there is no distinction between banknotes of the same denomination.
(5) All euro banknotes should be subject to identical acceptance and processing requirements by the Eurosystem members irrespective of which member put them into circulation. The practice of repatriation of banknotes denominated in national currency units to the issuing central bank does not apply to euro banknotes. The regime for the issue of the euro banknotes is based on the principle of non-repatriation of euro banknotes.
(6) Pursuant to Article 29.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, each central bank which is a member of the European System of Central Banks is assigned a weighting in the key for subscription to the ECB’s capital, as laid down by Decision ECB/2008/23 of 12 December 2008 on the national central banks’ percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital (3); this weighting is based on the population and gross domestic product of each Member State and governs the contributions to the ECB’s capital, the transfers of the NCBs’ foreign reserve assets to the ECB, the monetary income allocation of the NCBs, and the distribution of profits and sharing of losses of the ECB.
(7) Euro banknotes are legal tender in all Member States whose currency is the euro and freely circulate within the euro area, are reissued by the Eurosystem members, and may also be stored or used outside the euro area. The liabilities in respect of the issue of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation should therefore be allocated to the Eurosystem members in accordance with an objective criterion. An appropriate criterion is the share of each NCB in the paid-up capital of the ECB. This share results from a proportional application of the capital key referred to in Article 29.1 of the Statute of the ESCB to NCBs. As this criterion is not applicable to the ECB, the percentage share of euro banknotes to be issued by the ECB is to be determined by the Governing Council.
(8) Under Articles 9.2 and 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, establishing the principle of decentralisation for Eurosystem operations, the NCBs are entrusted with putting into and withdrawing from circulation all euro banknotes including those issued by the ECB. Consistent with this principle, the physical handling of euro banknotes is also carried out by the NCBs.
(9) The difference between the value of euro banknotes allocated to each NCB in accordance with the banknote allocation key and the value of the euro banknotes that such NCB puts into circulation should give rise to intra-Eurosystem balances. As the ECB does not put euro banknotes into circulation, it should hold intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs for a value equivalent to the share of euro banknotes that it issues. The remuneration of these intra-Eurosystem balances has an effect on the income positions of NCBs and is therefore the subject of Decision ECB/2010/23 of 25 November 2010 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro (4), based on Article 32 of the Statute of the ESCB.
(10) Pursuant to Article 1 of Council Decision 2010/416/EU of 13 July 2010 in accordance with Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Estonia of the euro on 1 January 2011 (5), Estonia fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro and the derogation granted to it under Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession (6) will be abrogated with effect from 1 January 2011.
(11) Given that Estonia will adopt the euro on 1 January 2011, Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro banknotes (7) needs to be amended in order to determine the banknote allocation key applying from 1 January 2011. Since Decision ECB/2001/15 has already been amended several times it should be recast in the interest of clarity,","{'header': '9.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 35/26', 'title': 'DECISION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK\nof 13 December 2010\non the issue of euro banknotes\n(recast)\n(ECB/2010/29)\n(2011/67/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 128(1) of the Treaty and Article 16 of the Statute of the ESCB, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has the exclusive right to authorise the issue of euro banknotes within the Union.

As this criterion is not applicable to the ECB, the percentage share of euro banknotes to be issued by the ECB is to be determined by the Governing Council.\n\n((8)) Under Articles 9.2 and 12.1 of the Statute of the ESCB, establishing the principle of decentralisation for Eurosystem operations, the NCBs are entrusted with putting into and withdrawing from circulation all euro banknotes including those issued by the ECB. Consistent with this principle, the physical handling of euro banknotes is also carried out by the NCBs.\n\n((9)) The difference between the value of euro banknotes allocated to each NCB in accordance with the banknote allocation key and the value of the euro banknotes that such NCB puts into circulation should give rise to intra-Eurosystem balances. As the ECB does not put euro banknotes into circulation, it should hold intra-Eurosystem claims on NCBs for a value equivalent to the share of euro banknotes that it issues. The remuneration of these intra-Eurosystem balances has an effect on the income positions of NCBs and is therefore the subject of Decision ECB/2010/23 of 25 November 2010 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of Member States whose currency is the euro(4), based on Article 32 of the Statute of the ESCB.\n\n((10)) Pursuant to Article 1 of Council Decision 2010/416/EU of 13 July 2010 in accordance with Article 140(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Estonia of the euro on 1 January 2011(5), Estonia fulfils the necessary conditions for adoption of the euro and the derogation granted to it under Article 4 of the 2003 Act of Accession(6)will be abrogated with effect from 1 January 2011.\n\n((11)) Given that Estonia will adopt the euro on 1 January 2011, Decision ECB/2001/15 of 6 December 2001 on the issue of euro banknotes(7)needs to be amended in order to determine the banknote allocation key applying from 1 January 2011.

of 16 July 2001
amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(2), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) On 31 August 1996, by means of two separate notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the Commission announced the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding(3) and an anti-subsidy proceeding(4) in respect of imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway.
(2) These proceedings resulted in anti-dumping and countervailing duties being imposed by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(5) and 1891/97(6) in September 1997 in order to eliminate the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation.
(3) In parallel, by Decision 97/634/EC(7), the Commission also accepted undertakings from 190 Norwegian exporters and imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway exported to the Community by these companies were exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties by Article 1(2) of those Regulations.
(4) The form of the duties was later reviewed and Regulations (EC) No 1890/97 and 1891/97 were replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(8).
B. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE UNDERTAKING
(5) The undertakings offered by the Norwegian companies oblige them, inter alia, to charge certain minimum prices when they export the product concerned to the Community and to provide detailed quarterly reports to the Commission of such sales.
(6) During a series of visits in November 2000 to the premises of several Norwegian companies with undertakings to verify the data appearing on their sales reports, it was found that one of the exporters visited, Haafa Fish AS (UT No 1/60, TARIC Additional Code 8302, ""Haafa fisk AS""), had breached its undertaking by providing misleading information regarding certain sales and not respecting the minimum import prices.
(7) The Commission's findings in this respect are set out more fully in Commission Decision 2001/544/EC(9).
(8) As acceptance of the undertaking has been withdrawn by the Commission, definitive anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties should be imposed forthwith against the company concerned.
C. CHANGES OF NAME AND OWNERSHIP
(9) One Norwegian exporter with an undertaking, Polar Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/140, TARIC Additional Code 8247 ), advised the Commission that the group of companies to which it belonged had been re-organised and that another company within the group was now responsible for exports to the Community. The company therefore requested that its name be replaced by that of the related company on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
(10) Two other exporters, Hydro Seafood Norway AS (UT No 1/66, TARIC Additional Code 8159 ) and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS (UT No 1/145, TARIC Additional Code 8256 ) advised the Commission that their ownership and names had changed, and requested that the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted be amended accordingly.
(11) Having verified the nature of the requests, the Commission considered that they are all acceptable since the modifications did not entail any substantive changes which would affect the assessment of dumping or subsidisation. Nor do these changes affect any of the considerations on which the acceptance of the undertaking was based.
(12) Consequently, the Commission Decision referred to at recital 7 changes the names of Polar Seafood Norway AS, Hydro Seafood Norway AS and Hydro Seafood Rogaland AS to Polar Salmon AS, Marine Harvest Norway AS and Marine Harvest Rogaland AS respectively on the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
D. CESSATION OF TRADING
(13) The Commission was also advised that two Norwegian companies with undertakings, Delfa Norge A/S (UT No 1/36, TARIC Additional Code 8134 ) and OK-Fish Kvalheim AS (UT No 1/134, TARIC Additional Code 8239 ) had recently ceased trading and had been wound up, or were in the process of being wound up. Accordingly, the names of these companies have been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
E. VOLUNTARY WITHDRAWAL OF AN UNDERTAKING
(14) Following changes in its trading patterns, Nova Sea AS (UT No 1/130, TARIC Additional Code 8235 ), advised the Commission that it wished to withdraw its undertaking. Accordingly, the name of this company has been deleted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
(15) In view, however, of the voluntary nature of the withdrawal, the company was advised that it could, if it so wished (and subject to certain conditions), offer an undertaking again in the future as a new exporter in accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 772/1999.
F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999
(16) In view of all the above, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 which lists the companies exempted from the anti-dumping and countervailing duties should be amended accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1469/2001 of 16 July 2001 amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 is hereby replaced by the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession, and in particular Article 54 (1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 355/79 (2), as last amended by the 1979 Act of Accession, laid down general rules for the description and presentation of wines and grape musts;
Whereas the rules in force for the description of table wines have not so far expressly covered table wines obtained by the coupage, with another product, of a table wine which was not made in the Member State where the grapes were harvested ; whereas, in the interests of clarity, the description of table wines so obtained should be laid down;
Whereas the definition of table wine given in point 11 of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 has been expanded to include a definition of ""retsina"" table wine ; whereas rules for the use of the term ""retsina"" should be laid down in the present Regulation;
Whereas, in order to provide the consumer with better information on the nature of a wine or grape must, provision should be made so that analytical data other than the alcoholic strength may be shown on the labelling;
Whereas the obligation to repeat, sometimes on an additional label, the expression ""Wine from different countries of the European Community"" in an official language of the Member State in which the wine in question is offered to the consumer has caused some practical difficulties ; whereas, in order to overcome these difficulties, which could increase the cost of distributing the products in question, a Member State should have discretion to derogate, in respect of the said wines put on the market in its territory, from the rule that the expression referred to above should be repeated in an official language of that Member State;
Whereas it is permitted to use, during a transitional period expiring on 31 August 1981, certain names of wine-growing regions to describe both table wines and quality wines psr ; whereas this period has proved too short to allow time for the necessary adaptations to be made to the relevant national rules ; whereas the date should therefore be postponed by one year;
Whereas, in order to ensure consistent application of the provisions prohibiting certain indications which might mislead the consumer, particularly those concerning the geographical origin, the vine variety, the vintage year, an expression implying a superior quality or the composition of the product, and in order to make the said provisions simpler to interpret, they should be adapted so that their scope in all the official languages of the Community is the same;
Whereas, to take account of commercial practice in the Community and in certain third countries, it has proved necessary to allow the number of the container or the number of the lot to be shown on the labelling of a quality wine psr or an imported wine the description of which includes geographical particulars;
Whereas the regions specified for production of quality wines are in some cases quite small and the consumer, particularly outside the producer Member State, has little idea of their whereabouts ; whereas, with a view to giving the consumer more information, it should be permitted to amplify the statement of the specified region from which the quality wine psr in question comes by adding the name of a larger geographical unit of which the said specified region is a part;
Whereas the transitional period during which producer Member States may, subject to certain conditions, allow the use of the name of a geographical unit smaller than the region determined for a quality wine psr made from a certain mixture of wines expires on 31 August 1981 ; whereas this transitional period has proved insufficient to allow for the national provisions concerned to be adapted ; whereas, therefore, this period should be extended for one year;  (1) OJ No L 54, 5.3.1979, p. 1. (2) OJ No L 54, 5.3.1979, p. 99.
Whereas experience acquired in the sale of certain products has shown that, in order to provide purchasers with fuller information, provision should be made for the possibility of indicating not only the total alcoholic strength by volume but also the actual alcoholic strength by volume;
Whereas details concerning the manner of manufacture, the type of the product or a particular colour are permitted at present for certain imported wines bearing a geographical indication ; whereas this is permitted subject to the condition that the said information is traditionally employed, and defined by provisions in the third country of origin ; whereas this provision imposes a heavy burden of supervision on national administrations ; whereas it is therefore proper to provide for a legal basis which will also make it possible to define the said details by means of Community provisions, retaining nevertheless the right to prohibit them in certain cases where the statements are not traditional or might be a source of confusion;
Whereas, for imported wines other than those referred to above, the said details are not permitted at present ; whereas experience has shown that, with regard to the said imported wines, the consumer needs to be better informed as to the type of wine ; whereas therefore, provision should be made for allowing the use of such information in respect of the said wines,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1016/81 of 9 April 1981 amending Regulation (EEC) No 355/79 laying down general rules for the description and presentation of wines and grape musts', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 (1) (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 355/79 is hereby replaced by the following text:', 'text': 'Article 2 (1) (d) of Regulation (EEC) No 355/79 is hereby replaced by the following text:\n\n""(d) in the case of:    (i) consignment to another Member State or export : the Member State in whose territory the grapes were harvested and turned into wine, provided that both these operations took place in the same Member State;\n\n(ii) table wine which was made in a Member State other than that in which the grapes were harvested : the initials ""EEC"";\n\n(iii) table wine resulting from coupage:      - of products originating in more than one Member State,\n\n- of a table wine referred to in (ii) above with another table wine or with another product with which coupage is permitted for the production of a table wine,\n\nthe words ""wine from different countries of the European Community"";""'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe following shall be added to Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 355/79:\n\n""(e) in the case of the table wines referred to in the third indent of point 11 of Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 : the word ""retsina"".""'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 21/2004 of 17 December 2003 establishing a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals (2) provides that each Member State is to establish a system for the identification and registration of ovine and caprine animals in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation.
(2) That Regulation also provides that, as from 1 January 2008, electronic identification is to become obligatory for all animals born after that date.
(3) In addition, that Regulation provides that the Commission is to submit to the Council, by 30 June 2006, a report on the implementation of the electronic identification system, accompanied by appropriate proposals, on which the Council is to vote confirming or amending, if necessary, the date of the introduction of the obligatory use of that system and to update, if necessary, some technical aspects relating to the implementation of electronic identification.
(4) The Commission report concludes that it is not possible to justify the date of 1 January 2008 as the date for the introduction of obligatory electronic identification. Therefore it is appropriate to amend this date by postponing it to 31 December 2009 in order to allow the Member States to take necessary measures to properly implement the system, taking into account its current and potential economic impact.
(5) A number of Member States have already developed the technology necessary for the introduction of electronic identification and gained significant experience with its implementation. They should not be prevented from introducing it at national level if they consider it appropriate. Their experience would provide the Commission and the other Member States with further valuable information on the technical implications of electronic identification and on its impact.
(6) Having regard to the economic importance of this Regulation, it is necessary to rely on the grounds of urgency provided for in point I.3 of the Protocol on the role of national parliaments in the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union, to the Treaty establishing the European Community and to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community.
(7) Since this Regulation is to apply from 1 January 2008, it should enter into force immediately.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91 of 16 December 1991 introducing specific measures in respect of certain agricultural products for the benefit of the French overseas departments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2598/95 (2), and in particular Article 4 (5) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3813/92 of 28 December 1992 on the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), and in particular Article 12 thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 3763/91, the number of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats originating in the Community and qualifying for aid with a view to developing production potential in the French overseas departments should be determined for each annual period of application;
Whereas the aid referred to above for the supply of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats originating in the rest of the Community to the French overseas departments should be fixed; whereas that aid must be fixed in the light, in particular, of the costs of supply from the Community market and the conditions resulting from the geographical situation of the French overseas departments;
Whereas special needs may arise during the course of different marketing years for the supply to the French overseas departments of pure-bred breeding sheep and goats; whereas, therefore, the French authorities should be granted a degree of flexibility in administering the supply arrangements, in that they should be allowed to issue aid certificates for animals intended for certain overseas departments in excess of the maximum quantities available to those departments, provided that the maximum quantities available to the four departments of both male and female animals are respected; whereas, so as to take account of those special needs, the French authorities should notify the Commission of the cases where that facility was used for the issue of certificates;
Whereas common detailed rules for the application of the arrangements for the supply of certain agricultural products to the French overseas departments are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 131/92 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1736/96 (5); whereas additional detailed rules should be laid down in line with current commercial practice in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector, in particular as regards the term of validity of aid certificates and the securities ensuring operators' compliance with their obligations;
Whereas, with a view to sound administration of the supply arrangements, a timetable should be laid down for the lodging of certificate applications and for a period of reflection for their issue;

(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72 (2).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.

However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period.

The funds borrowed by International Finance Facility for Immunisation in the international capital markets will finance immunisation programmes in 70 of the poorest countries in the world. International Finance Facility for Immunisation will act as a bank to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation to provide funds that will be disbursed as grants to eligible developing countries’ immunisation programmes. International Finance Facility for Immunisation will outsource its two primary activities to existing multinational entities: financing, financial management and risk management will be outsourced to the World Bank and programme management and secretariat functions will be outsourced to Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation.
(6) International Finance Facility for Immunisation has a risk profile equivalent to the multilateral development banks enumerated in Annex VI, Part 1, point 20 of Directive 2006/48/EC and is therefore eligible for inclusion into Annex VI, Part 1, point 20 and in consequence to benefit from a 0 % risk weight as laid down in that provision.
(7) The Islamic Development Bank has requested that it be included in the list in Annex VI, Part 1, point 20 of Directive 2006/48/EC.
(8) The Islamic Development Bank has been set up by the governments of 29 countries with predominantly Muslim populations for the purpose of fostering economic development and social progress of member countries and Muslim communities individually as well as jointly and in accordance with “Shariah” rules. The Islamic Development Bank may undertake any activities which may advance this purpose. The agreement explicitly mentions e.g. equity investments, loans, trade finance and technical assistance.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer (1), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Community has already phased out the production and consumption of chlorofluorocarbons, other fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, hydrobromofluorocarbon and bromochloromethane.
(2) Each year the Commission is required to determine essential uses for these controlled substances, the quantities that may be used and the companies that may use them.
(3) Decision IV/25 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, hereinafter ‘the Montreal Protocol’, sets out the criteria used by the Commission for determining any essential uses and authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances in each Party.
(4) The Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorised the production in the European Community of 22 tonnes of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 2009 for the manufacturing and use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) qualifying for essential uses of CFCs as defined in Decision IV/25.
(5) Decision XIX/18 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption necessary to satisfy essential uses of controlled substances listed in Annexes A, B and C (Group II and III substances) of the Montreal Protocol for laboratory and analytical uses as listed in Annex IV to the report of the Seventh Meeting of the Parties, subject to the conditions set out in Annex II to the report of the Sixth Meeting of the Parties, as well as Decisions VII/11, XI/15 and XV/5 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Decision XVII/10 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol authorises the production and consumption of the controlled substance listed in Annex E of the Montreal Protocol necessary to satisfy laboratory and analytical critical uses of methyl bromide.
(6) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Decision XII/2 of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on measures to facilitate the transition to chlorofluorocarbon-free MDIs, all Member States have notified the United Nations Environment Programme the active ingredients for which chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are no longer essential for the manufacture of MDIs for placing on the market of the European Community.
(7) Article 4(4)(i)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFCs from being used and placed on the market unless they are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1) of that Regulation. These non-essentiality determinations have therefore reduced the demand for CFCs used in MDIs that are placed on the market of the European Community. In addition, Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 prevents CFC-MDI products being imported and placed on the market unless the CFCs in these products are considered essential under the conditions described in Article 3(1).
(8) The Commission has published a notice (2) to those companies in the Member States that request consideration by the Commission for the use of controlled substances for essential uses in the Community in 2009 and has received declarations on intended essential uses of controlled substances for 2009.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs(1), and in particular Article 17(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Additional information was requested for a name notified by Germany under Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 in order to ensure that it complied with Articles 2 and 4 of that Regulation. That additional information shows that the name complies with the said Articles. It should therefore be registered and added to the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1107/96(2).
(2) Following notification of the application by the German authorities to register the name ""Bayerisches Bier"" as a protected geographical indication, the Dutch and Danish authorities informed the Commission of the existence of trade marks used for beer which include that name.
(3) The information provided confirms the existence of the name ""Bavaria"" as a valid trade mark. In view of the facts and information available, it was, however, considered that registration of the name ""Bayerisches Bier"" was not liable to mislead the consumer as to the true identity of the product. Consequently, the geographical indication ""Bayerisches Bier"" and the trade mark ""Bavaria"" are not in the situation referred to in Article 14(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.
(4) The use of certain trade marks, for example, the Dutch trade mark ""Bavaria"" and the Danish trade mark ""Høker Bajer"" may continue notwithstanding the registration of the geographical indication ""Bayerisches Bier"" as long as they fulfil the conditions provided for in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92.
(5) In accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, the generic nature of a name hindering its registration must be assessed with regard to the Community situation as a whole. In this particular case, despite evidence to the effect that the terms ""bajersk"" and ""bajer"", Danish translations of the name ""Bayerisches"", are becoming synonyms for the term ""beer"" and hence a common name, the generic nature of the name ""Bayerisches"" or its translations in other languages and Member States has not been demonstrated.

Whereas an average world market price for linseed must be determined each year according to the criteria laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1774/76 of 20 July 1976 on special measures for linseed (3);
Whereas Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1799/76 of 22 July 1976 laying down detailed rules for the application of special measures in respect of linseed (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2888/86 (5), provides that this average price is to be the arithmetic mean of the world market prices as referred to in that Article and recorded each week over a representative period;
Whereas the most representative period for the marketing of Community linseed may be taken to be that from 1 September 1986 to 6 March 1987; whereas this is therefore the period to be taken into account;
Whereas the application of all these provisions produces the average world market price for linseed specified below;
Whereas Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 569/76 provides that the subsidy is to be granted for a production figure obtained by applying an indicative yield to the areas sown and harvested; whereas that yield must be determined by applying the criteria laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 569/76 and (EEC) No 1774/76;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1799/76, the producer Member States have supplied the Commission with the results of the sampling, carried out pursuant to Article 2a (2) of that Regulation, regarding the yields per hectare of seed harvested from each of the types of flax referred to in Articles 7a and 10a of the said Regulation in the homogeneous production areas; whereas, on the basis of those results, the indicative yield for linseed should be that specified below;

of 8 February 2011
amending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include bifenthrin as an active substance in Annex I thereto
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes bifenthrin.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, bifenthrin has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product type 8, wood preservatives, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) France was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 3 January 2008 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 24 September 2010, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from the evaluations that biocidal products used as wood preservatives and containing bifenthrin may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC. It is therefore appropriate to include bifenthrin in Annex I to that Directive.
(6) Not all potential uses have been evaluated at the Union level. It is therefore appropriate that Member States assess those uses or exposure scenarios and those risks to environmental compartments and populations that have not been representatively addressed in the Union level risk assessment and, when granting product authorisations, ensure that appropriate measures are taken or specific conditions imposed in order to reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.
(7) Unacceptable risks were identified for non-professional users. It is therefore appropriate to require that product authorisations are limited to industrial or professional use, unless it is demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to non-professional users can be reduced to acceptable levels in accordance with Article 5 of, and Annex VI to, Directive 98/8/EC.
(8) In view of the assumptions made during the risk assessment, it is appropriate to require that products authorised for industrial or professional use are used with appropriate personal protective equipment, unless it can be demonstrated in the application for product authorisation that risks to industrial or professional users can be reduced to an acceptable level by other means.
(9) In view of the risks identified for the soil and aquatic compartments, appropriate measures should be taken to protect those compartments. It is therefore appropriate to require that instructions are provided to indicate that freshly treated timber is stored after treatment under shelter or on impermeable hardstanding, or both, and that any losses from the application of products used as wood preservatives and containing bifenthrin are collected for reuse or disposal. Furthermore, it is appropriate to require that products are not authorised for the in situ treatment of wood outdoors, or for treatment of wood that will be either continually exposed to the weather or protected from the weather but subject to frequent wetting (use class 3 as defined by OECD (3), unless data is submitted demonstrating that the product will meet the requirements of Article 5 of, and Annex VI to, Directive 98/8/EC, if necessary by the application of appropriate risk mitigation measures.
(10) It is important that the provisions of this Directive be applied simultaneously in all Member States in order to ensure equal treatment of biocidal products on the market containing the active substance bifenthrin and also to facilitate the proper operation of the biocidal products market in general.
(11) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC in order to permit Member States and interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements entailed and to ensure that applicants who have prepared dossiers can benefit fully from the 10-year period of data protection, which, in accordance with Article 12(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 98/8/EC, starts from the date of inclusion.
(12) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period to implement Article 16(3) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(13) Directive 98/8/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '9.2.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 34/41', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2011/10/EU\nof 8 February 2011\namending Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council to include bifenthrin as an active substance in Annex I thereto\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market(2)establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 1124/2010
of 29 November 2010
fixing for 2011 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in the Baltic Sea
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 43(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 43(3) of the Treaty, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, should adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy (1) requires that measures governing access to waters and resources and the sustainable pursuit of fishing activities be established taking into account available scientific advice and, in particular, the report drawn up by the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF).
(3) It is incumbent upon the Council to adopt measures on the fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities by fishery or group of fisheries, including certain conditions functionally linked thereto, as appropriate. Fishing opportunities should be distributed among Member States in such a way as to assure each Member State relative stability of fishing activities for each stock or fishery and having due regard to the objectives of the common fisheries policy established in Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002.
(4) The total allowable catches (TACs) should be established on the basis of the available scientific advice, by taking into account the biological and socioeconomic aspects whilst ensuring fair treatment between fishing sectors, as well as in light of the opinions expressed during the consultation of stakeholders, in particular at the meetings with the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture and the concerned Regional Advisory Councils.

The isotopic ratio >NUM>18O\n\n>DEN>16O\n\ncan be expressed in deviation ä &permil; in ratio to the value of isotopic ratio of the international reference V.SMOW:\n\näi [&permil;] = [ >NUM>Ri\n\n>DEN>RSMOW\n\n-1 ] × 1 000\n\n2. Principle\n\nThe isotopic ratio >NUM>18O\n\n>DEN>16O\n\nis determined by mass spectrometry of isotopic ratios (MSIR) from ionic currents m/z 46 (12C16O18O) and m/z 44 (12C16O2) produced by carbon dioxide obtained after an exchange with the water in wine according to the reaction:\n\nC16O2 + H218O  , . C16O18O + H216O\n\nThe carbon dioxide in the gaseous phase is used for analysis.\n\n3. Reagents\n\n- Carbon dioxide for analysis\n\n- SMOW (Standard Mean Ocean Water)\n\n- GISP (Greenland Ice Sheet Precipitation)\n\n- SLAP (Standard Light Arctic Precipitation)\n\n- Reference water specific to the laboratory carefully standardized in relation to the reference sample of the International Agency of Atomic Energy in Vienna (IAEA).\n\n4. Laboratory equipment\n\n- mass spectrometer of isotopic ratios with an internal repeatability of 0,05 &permil;\n\n- triple collector for simultaneous recording of ions m/z 44, 45 and 46 or, by default, a double collector for measuring ions m/z 44 and 46\n\n- thermostated system (± 0,5 °C) to carry out the equilibration between CO2 and the water content in wine\n\n- vacuum pump able to reach an internal pressure of 0,13 Pa\n\n- phials for samples having 15 ml volume and a capillary annex tube with an interior diameter of about 0,015 mm\n\n- Eppendorf pipette with plastic throw-away cone.\n\n5. Experimental determinations\n\n5.1. Manual method\n\nOperational mode of the equilibration method\n\nIntroduction of the sample\n\n- Take the Eppendorf pipette at the fixed volume of 1,5 ml, adapt a cone and pump the liquid to be analysed in order to insert it in a balloon flask. Then, place silicon grease around the neck of the balloon flask and attach the balloon flask to the valve while verifying that it is tightly shut,\n\n- Repeat the operation for each balloon flask on the work ramp while introducing the laboratory's reference water into one of the balloons.\n\nDegasing of the ramp\n\nThe two ramps are cooled down with liquid nitrogen, then the whole system is purged up to 0,1 mm Hg by opening the valves.\n\nThen, shut the valves off and let it all heat up. The degasing cycle is repeated until there is no more pressure variation.\n\nEquilibration of the water and the CO2\n\nCool the work ramps to - 70 °C (Liquid nitrogen and alcohol mix) to freeze the water and put it all in a vacuum. After stabilization of the vacuum, isolate the ramp by actioning the valve and purge the CO2 introduction system. Insert the gaseous CO2 into the work ramp and, after having isolated it from the rest of the system, introduce the ramp in a thermostated bath at 25 °C (± 0,5 °C) for 12 hours (one night). To optimize the necessary time for equilibration, it is advisable to prepare the samples at the end of the day and let the balance settle overnight.\n\nTransfer of the CO2 exchanged in the measuring cells\n\nA sample holder which supports as many measuring cells as balloon flasks containing exchanged CO2 is adapted on the empty line next to the work ramp. The empty cells are carefully purged and the exchanged gases contained in the ballons are transferred one after the other, into the measuring cells which have been cooled by liquid nitrogen. Then the measuring cells are allowed to heat up at room temperature.\n\n5.2. Use of an automatic exchange apparatus\n\nIn order to carry out the equilibration, sample phials are filled with either 2 ml of wine or 2 ml of water (laboratory work reference) and cooled down to - 18 °C. The sample slides containing the frozen products are adapted to the equilibration system, and after having created a vacuum in the system, carbon dioxide is introduced at a pressure of 800 hPa.\n\nThe balance is reached at a temperature of 22 ± 0,5 °C after a minimum period of five hours and with moderate agitation. Since the equilibration duration depends on the phial's geometry, the optimum duration should be determined first for the system used.\n\nCarbon dioxide contained in the phials is then transferred to the introduction chamber of the mass spectrometer by a capillary tube and the measurement is carried out according to a specific protocol for each kind of equipment.\n\n6. Calculation and expression of the results\n\nThe relative difference ä' of the ratio intensities of ions m/z 46 and 44 (\n\n>NUM>É46\n\n>DEN>É44\n\n) between the sample and the reference is expressed in &permil; by means of the following equation:\n\nä' sample = [ >NUM>(\n\n>NUM>I46\n\n>DEN>I44\n\n) sample\n\n>DEN>(\n\n>NUM>I46\n\n>DEN>I44\n\n) reference\n\n-1 ] × 1 000\n\nThe 18Ï content of the sample compared to the reference V.SMOW on the V.SMOW/SLAP scale, is given by the relation:\n\nä' 18O = [ >NUM>ä' sample - ä' SMOW\n\n>DEN>ä' SMOW - ä' SLAP\n\n] × 55,5\n\nThe value accepted for SLAP is equal to - 55,5 &permil; compared to V.SMOW. The isotopic ratio of reference must be determined after each series of 10 measurements on unknown samples.\n\n7.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 of 17 December 1992 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3318/94(2), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 is to be granted under certain conditions to Community tuna producers' organisations in respect of quantities of tuna delivered to the processing industry during the calendar quarter for which prices have been recorded, where both the average quarterly selling price recorded on the Community market and the free-at-frontier price plus any applicable countervailing charge are lower than 91 % of the Community producer price for the product concerned.
(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market has shown that in the period 1 October to 31 December 1999 both the average quarterly selling price and the free-at-frontier price as referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) not weighing more than 10 kg each and skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) were lower than 91 % of the Community producer price in force laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 2763/98 of 17 December 1998 fixing, for the 1999 fishing year, the Community producer price for tuna intended for the industrial manufacture of products falling within CN code 1604(3).
(3) The amount of the allowance provided for in Article 18(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 may not in any case exceed either the difference between the triggering threshold and the average selling price of the product in question on the Community market or a flat-rate amount equivalent to 12 % of that threshold.
(4) The quantities on which compensation as provided for in Article 18(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 is payable may under no circumstances exceed the limits laid down in paragraph 3 of that Article for the quarter concerned.
(5) The quantities of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) weighing more than 10 kg each, yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) not weighing more than 10 kg each and skipjack or stripe-bellied bonito (Euthynnus (Katsuwonus) pelamis) sold and delivered to the processing industry established in the customs territory of the Community were higher during the quarter concerned than the quantities sold and delivered during the same quarter of the three previous fishing years. Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 18(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should therefore be limited.
(6) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 18(4) of Regulation (EEC) No 3759/92 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producers' organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producers' organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 1996, 1997 and 1998 fishing years.

of 4 December 1989
opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for frozen peas originating in Sweden (1990)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas an Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Kingdom of Sweden was concluded on 22 July 1972; whereas following the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community, an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters has been concluded and approved by Council Decision 86/558/EEC (1);
Whereas the said Agreement provides for the opening of a 6 000-tonne Community tariff quota at a reduced rate of duty for frozen peas originating in Sweden, 4 500 tonnes of which are reserved for Spain; whereas therefore, the tariff quota in question should be opened for the period from 1 January to 31 December 1990;
Whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should be ensured for all Community importers and the rate laid down for the quota should be applied consistently to all imports until the quota is exhausted; whereas, during the period of application of this Regulation, it seems necessary to keep a certain allocation of the quota in question among the Member States on account of the requirement in the Agreement to reserve the major part of the quota amount for Spain; whereas it is therefore appropriate to subdivide the quota amount into two parts, the first one amounting to 4 500 tonnes allocated from the outset to Spain, the second one amounting to 1 500 tonnes to constitute a reserve from which the other Member States and where appropriate, the Kingdom of Spain could, for quantities that may exist on a given date after the Member State has returned to the first part unused quantities on that date, draw the necessary quantities to cover their actual needs; whereas this method of management requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and requires the Commission in particular to be able to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and inform the Member States accordingly;
Whereas if at a given date in the quota period a considerable quantity of Spain's initial share remains unused, it is essential that the Member State concerned should return any unused quantities in order to prevent part of the the Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation concerning the administration of this quota may be carried out by any one of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3710/89 of 4 December 1989 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for frozen peas originating in Sweden (1990)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 1999/53/EC(2), and in particular Article 15(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Where a Member State considers that there is a danger of spreading a harmful organism not listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 77/93/EEC and whose presence was previously unknown in its territory, it may temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger.
(2) The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and France informed the other Member States and the Commission on 19 October 1999, 12 November 1999, 13 January 2000 and 17 February 2000 respectively of recent outbreaks of Pepino mosaic virus on tomato crops, in their respective countries and on the measures taken to control it with the aim of eradication.
(3) It is known that Pepino mosaic virus was first described in Peru on pepino, Solanum muricatum Ait. in 1980; there is no evidence that it has been detected outside Peru, until it appeared in the Community pursuant to the aforesaid information; however the source of contamination has not yet been clarified.
(4) Pepino mosaic virus is currently not listed in Annex I or Annex II to Directive 77/93/EEC; however, a preliminary pest risk analysis based on available scientific information has demonstrated that Pepino mosaic virus and its damaging effects could be of significant plant health concern to the Community, in particular for protected tomato production; the risk to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops, especially potatoes, has not yet fully been established. The relevant services in the Member States have been asked to continue scientific work and to deliver an opinion on the risk of Pepino mosaic virus to outdoor production of tomatoes and of other Solanaceae crops.
(5) Directive 77/93/EEC prohibits the introduction of plants of Solanaceae, intended for planting, other than seeds and other than those covered by Annex III, part A, points 10, 11 or 12 thereof, originating in third countries, other than European and Mediterranean countries.
(6) On the basis of the precautionary principle, it is therefore necessary provisionally to take specific measures against the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus.
(7) These specific measures should apply to the introduction or the spread of Pepino mosaic virus, the production and the movements of tomato plants, intended for planting, other than seeds and to a more general monitoring for the presence or continued absence of Pepino mosaic virus in the Member States.
(8) The results of the above measures will be continually assessed in 2000 and 2001, in particular on the basis of information to be provided by the Member States. Possible subsequent measures will be considered in the light of the results of that assessment, and the scientific opinion delivered by the relevant services of the Member States.
(9) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'title': '2000/325/EC: Commission Decision of 11 May 2000 authorising Member States to take measures provisionally against the introduction into, and the spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus as regards tomato plants, intended for planting, other than seeds (notified under document number C(2000) 1312)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe introduction into and spread within the Community of Pepino mosaic virus, as regards tomato plants, intended for planting, other than seeds, shall be banned until 30 April 2001.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nPlants of tomato, Lycopersicon lycopersicum (L.)

(3) Belgium received a similar application in August 1997 from Novartis NV (now Syngenta) concerning S-metolachlor. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 98/512/EC(5).
(4) The Netherlands received a similar application in July 1996 from Biosys concerning Spodoptera exigua nuclear polyhedrosis virus. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 97/865/EC(6).
(5) Spain received a similar application in September 1997 from BASF AG concerning tepraloxydim. This dossier was declared complete by Decision 98/512/EC.
(6) Germany received a similar application in April 1999 from BASF AG concerning dimethenamid-P. This dossier was declared complete by Commission Decision 1999/555/EC(7).
(7) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the condition relating to the detailed assessment of the active substance and the plant protection product in the light of the requirements laid down by the Directive.
(8) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the respective applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 30 May 2000 (iodosulfuron-methyl-sodium), 7 February 2000 (indoxacarb), 3 May 1999 (S-metolachlor), 9 November 1999 (Spodoptera exigua NPV), 21 January 2001 (tepraloxydim) and 26 September 2000 (dimethenamid-P).
(9) The examination of the dossiers is still ongoing after submission of the draft assessment reports by the respective rapporteur Member States and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe foreseen by Directive 91/414/EEC.
(10) As the evaluation so far has not identified any reason for immediate concern, Member States should be given the possibility of prolonging provisional authorisations granted for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned for a period of 24 months in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 of Directive 91/414/EEC so as to enable the examination of the dossiers to continue. It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on possible Annex I inclusion for each of the active substances concerned will have been completed within 24 months.

of 10 April 2013
making imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia subject to registration
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic Regulation’), and in particular Articles 16(4) and 24(5) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) On 10 November 2012, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2) (‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia (‘the countries concerned’) following a complaint lodged on 26 September 2012 by the European Biodiesel Board (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing more than 25 % of the total Union production of biodiesel.
A.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(2) The product concerned by this registration is the same as that defined in the notice of initiation, i.e. fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, currently falling within CN codes ex 1516 20 98, ex 1518 00 91, ex 1518 00 95, ex 1518 00 99, ex 2710 19 43, ex 2710 19 46, ex 2710 19 47, 2710 20 11, 2710 20 15, 2710 20 17, ex 3824 90 97, 3826 00 10 and ex 3826 00 90, and originating in the countries concerned.
B.   REQUEST
(3) Following the publication of the notice of initiation, the complainant requested in December 2012 that imports of the product concerned are made subject to registration pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration.
C.   GROUNDS FOR THE REGISTRATION
(4) According to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, direct the customs authorities to take the appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports may be made subject to registration following a request from the Union industry which contains sufficient evidence to justify such action.
(5) The complainant claimed that registration is justified as the product concerned was being subsidised and injury to the Union industry, which is difficult to repair, was caused by the surge in subsidised imports in a relatively short period of time.
(6) The Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that imports of the product concerned from the countries concerned are being subsidised. In the anti-subsidy complaint the Union industry provided evidence that the product concerned is being subsidised in both countries concerned through a system of Differential Export Taxation. In both countries concerned an export tax is charged on the raw material, at rates which are higher than those charged on the export of biodiesel. This approach effectively obliges the producers of the raw material to sell on the domestic market, thus depressing prices and artificially reducing the costs of the biodiesel producers. The evidence in the complaint provides sufficient support at this stage that the exporters in question are being subsidised in their exports of biodiesel.
(7) As regards injury, the Commission has at its disposal sufficient prima facie evidence that the exporting producers’ subsidisation is causing material injury to the Union industry, which is difficult to repair. This evidence consists of detailed data, contained in the anti-subsidy complaint and request for registration and supported by information from the industry and public sources, concerning the key injury factors set out in Article 8(5) of the basic Regulation.
(8) The request also provides sufficient evidence of critical circumstances where, for the subsidised product in question, injury, which is difficult to repair, is caused by massive imports benefiting from countervailable subsidies in a relatively short period of time. Evidence of such circumstances includes the rapid nature of the deterioration of the situation of the Union industry.
(9) The level of imports of biodiesel from the countries concerned reaches a peak during spring and summer as, due to its physical and chemical properties, the use of these products is limited when temperatures are low. In view of the initiation of the current proceeding, it is likely that the exporting producers will negotiate contracts with EU importers for sales of increased volumes of biodiesel prior to the adoption of provisional measures, if any, and inventories will be rapidly built up by importers. The period prior to the initiation also showed a strong increase of imports.
(10) In view of the above, it may be necessary, in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury, to assess countervailing duties, if any, retroactively on those imports.
D.   PROCEDURE
(11) In view of the above, the Commission has concluded that the complainant provided sufficient evidence to justify making imports of the product concerned subject to registration in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.
(12) All interested parties are invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
E.   REGISTRATION
(13) Pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings leading to the imposition of anti-subsidy duties, those duties should, if the necessary conditions are fulfilled, be levied retroactively in accordance with applicable legal provisions.
(14) Any future liability would emanate from the findings of the anti-subsidy investigation. The allegations in the complaint requesting the initiation of an investigation mentions subsidy margins of 18 % for Indonesia, and 30 % for Argentina, and injury margins between 28,5 and 29,5 % for Argentina and between 35,5 and 37,5 % for Indonesia.
(15) In order that the registration is sufficiently effective in view of eventual retroactive levying of an anti-subsidy duty, the declarant should indicate on the customs declaration the proportion in blends, by weight, of the total content of fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and of paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin (biodiesel content).
F.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(16) Any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3),","{'header': '11.4.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 102/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 330/2013\nof 10 April 2013\nmaking imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia subject to registration', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 10 November 2012, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) announced by a notice published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2)(‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of biodiesel originating in Argentina and Indonesia (‘the countries concerned’) following a complaint lodged on 26 September 2012 by the European Biodiesel Board (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing more than 25\xa0% of the total Union production of biodiesel.', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Customs authorities shall, pursuant to Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Union of fatty-acid mono-alkyl esters and/or paraffinic gasoils obtained from synthesis and/or hydro-treatment, of non-fossil origin, in pure form or as included in a blend, currently falling within CN codes ex\xa01516\xa020\xa098  (TARIC codes 1516\xa020\xa098\xa021, 1516\xa020\xa098\xa029 and 1516\xa020\xa098\xa030), ex\xa01518\xa000\xa091  (TARIC codes 1518\xa000\xa091\xa021, 1518\xa000\xa091\xa029 and 1518\xa000\xa091\xa030), ex\xa01518\xa000\xa095  (TARIC code 1518\xa000\xa095\xa010), ex\xa01518\xa000\xa099  (TARIC codes 1518\xa000\xa099\xa021, 1518\xa000\xa099\xa029 and 1518\xa000\xa099\xa030), ex\xa02710\xa019\xa043  (TARIC codes 2710\xa019\xa043\xa021, 2710\xa019\xa043\xa029 and 2710\xa019\xa043\xa030), ex\xa02710\xa019\xa046  (TARIC codes 2710\xa019\xa046\xa021, 2710\xa019\xa046\xa029 and 2710\xa019\xa046\xa030), ex\xa02710\xa019\xa047  (TARIC codes 2710\xa019\xa047\xa021, 2710\xa019\xa047\xa029 and 2710\xa019\xa047\xa030), 2710\xa020\xa011 , 2710\xa020\xa015 , 2710\xa020\xa017 , ex\xa03824\xa090\xa097  (TARIC codes 3824\xa090\xa097\xa001, 3824\xa090\xa097\xa003 and 3824\xa090\xa097\xa004), 3826\xa000\xa010  and ex\xa03826\xa000\xa090  (TARIC codes 3826\xa000\xa090\xa011, 3826\xa000\xa090\xa019 and 3826\xa000\xa090\xa030), and originating in Argentina and Indonesia.

of 25 September 1990
liberalizing or suspending quantitative restrictions applying to certain countries of Central and Eastern Europe and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3420/83 and (EEC) No 288/82 accordingly
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 of 14 November 1983 on import arrangements for products originating in State-trading countries, not liberalized at Community level (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89 (2), applies inter alia to imports originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic and Romania;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 288/82 of 5 February 1982 on common rules for imports (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3365/89 (4), applies to imports originating in a variety of third countries, inter alia Yugoslavia; whereas most of the quantitative restrictions relating to products originating in that country were abolished pursuant to Article 15 of the Cooperation Agreement between the Community and that country signed in Belgrade on 2 April 1980 (5);
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1765/82 of 30 June 1982 on common rules for imports from State-trading countries (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1434/90 (7), provides that imports of the products listed in its Annex are not subject to any quantitative restrictions;
Whereas at the Ministerial meeting of the Group of 24 Western nations (G-24) on 4 July 1990 the Community established that the conditions were met in certain Central and East European countries for the extension of the aid for the reconstruction of their economies;
Whereas in order to contribute to the modernization of the economic fabric of the countries concerned, primarily by means of an increase in their exports, specific quantitative restrictions should be lifted, namely the restrictions applied in each region of the Commnity to imports originating in each of the countries to which Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 applies, other than imports subject to quantitative restrictions by virtue of Regulation (EEC) No 288/82, and the remaining quantitative restrictions, termed 'non-specific', which apply to the release for free circulation within the Community of certain products originating in these countries, should be suspended; whereas the Community has already taken steps of this kind for Poland and Hungary within the framework of Regulation (EEC) No 3381/89 (8) and Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89;
Whereas as regards non-specific quantitative restrictions it would be appropriate to allow suspension, the aim of which is to allow the countries of Central and Eastern Europe to integrate themselves more rapidly into international economic life, to continue for the period needed for economic restructuring; whereas a period ending on 31 December 1991 seems suitable for the present; whereas a suspension lasting until 31 December 1990 for products originating in Poland and Hungary was introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3691/89; whereas it therefore seems appropriate to extend this suspension until 31 December 1991 in order to make its expiry coincide with that for products originating in other countries;
Whereas a blanket suspension of all quantitative restrictions for an unlimited period has been introduced for the German Democratic Republic from 1 July 1990 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1794/90 (9) and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1759/90 (10);
Whereas in the case of textile products it is important to align the trade arrangements for these countries of Central and Eastern Europe on those for all the other countries with which the Community has negotiated bilateral textile agreements; whereas it is therefore necessary to exclude outward processing traffic (OPT) involving these products from the liberalization measures provided for in this Regulation;
Wher    these liberalization measures must remain compatible with the economic situation in certain particularly sensitive sectors of Community production; whereas it should be possible to restore some of these restrictions while observing the relevant procedures and rules, in order to remedy adverse situations which might
arise in the Community; whereas in the light of the provisions of the Act of Accession (Articles 177 and 364), provision should be made that the non-specific quantitative restrictions should not be suspended by the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/90 of 24 September 1990 liberalizing or suspending quantitative restrictions applying to certain countries of central and eastern Europe and amending Regulations (EEC) No 3420/83 and (EEC) No 288/82 accordingly', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 shall be replaced by the following:', 'text': ""Article 2 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3420/83 shall be replaced by the following:\n\n'1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2860/2000(4), lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 with respect to the conditions for granting area payments for certain arable crops and sets out the conditions for set-aside.
(2) Article 18 of the above Regulation limits eligibility for set-aside payments to areas that in the preceding year were cultivated with a view to a harvest, set aside in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1251/1999 or withdrawn from the production of arable crops or afforested in accordance with rural development legislation.
(3) Application of these conditions is no longer of any practical interest in view of the long period which has passed since their introduction. Moreover, checks on compliance with this Article involve a disproportionately high amount of effort compared with the purpose of the measure. These restrictive conditions should therefore be abolished in order to simplify the rules.
(4) New varieties of flax and hemp grown for fibre may be considered eligible. These should therefore be included in the list of varieties of flax and hemp grown for fibre eligible for the support system in Annex XII to Regulation (EC) No 2316/1999.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (1), and in particular Article 4(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs (2) lays down microbiological criteria for certain micro-organisms and the implementing rules to be complied with by food business operators when implementing the general and specific hygiene measures referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.
(2) According to the article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 microbiological criteria shall be reviewed taking into account progress in science, technology and methodology, emerging pathogenic micro-organisms in foodstuffs, and information from risk assessments.
(3) Chapter 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 sets out food safety criteria for Listeria monocytogenes in certain ready-to-eat foods. Part 1.3 provides limits for ready-to-eat foods unable to support the growth of L. monocytogenes, other than those intended for infants and for special medical purposes. Food business operators are required to prove compliance with the criteria in products placed on the market during their shelf-life.
(4) According to the Regulation (EC) 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (3), food grade salt is a ready-to-eat food. According to scientific evidence, presence and survival of L. monocytogenes in salt is unlikely in normal circumstances. Therefore, food grade salt should be added to footnote 4 of Chapter 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 which provides for the ready-to-eat foods in which regular testing of L. monocytogenes is not required.
(5) According to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005, a process hygiene criterion applies to Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products including an analytical reference method and limits.
(6) The analytical reference method set out for Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products ISO 21528-1 has been shown to be difficult to use for routine analyses in own checks since it is very laborious and time consuming. Due to the methodological development the analytical reference method of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products should be changed to ISO 21528-2 which is quicker and easier to perform.
(7) Analytical reference methods have an effect on test results. Therefore, the criterion limit of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products needs to be changed accordingly. The change would still guarantee sufficient detection limit for the process hygiene since likely problems in the manufacturing process would cause much higher growth of Enterobacteriaceae.
(8) Given a recent change in taxonomy the name of Enterobacter sakazakii in Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should be changed to Cronobacter spp. (Enterobacter sakazakii).
(9) Some of the provisions were applicable until 1 January 2010 and new ones already laid down in the Regulation will apply thereafter. To facilitate readability of these provisions, it is appropriate to delete the old ones.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,","{'header': '29.4.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 107/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 365/2010\nof 28 April 2010\namending Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs as regards Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products andListeria monocytogenesin food grade salt\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 of 15 November 2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs(2)lays down microbiological criteria for certain micro-organisms and the implementing rules to be complied with by food business operators when implementing the general and specific hygiene measures referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004.\n\n((2)) According to the article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 microbiological criteria shall be reviewed taking into account progress in science, technology and methodology, emerging pathogenic micro-organisms in foodstuffs, and information from risk assessments.\n\n((3)) Chapter 1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 sets out food safety criteria forListeria monocytogenesin certain ready-to-eat foods.

Therefore, the criterion limit of Enterobacteriaceae in pasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products needs to be changed accordingly. The change would still guarantee sufficient detection limit for the process hygiene since likely problems in the manufacturing process would cause much higher growth of Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n((8)) Given a recent change in taxonomy the name ofEnterobacter sakazakiiin Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should be changed toCronobacterspp.(Enterobacter sakazakii).\n\n((9)) Some of the provisions were applicable until 1 January 2010 and new ones already laid down in the Regulation will apply thereafter. To facilitate readability of these provisions, it is appropriate to delete the old ones.\n\n((10)) Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and neither the European Parliament nor the Council has opposed them,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nAnnex I to Regulation (EC) No 2073/2005 is amended as follows:\n1.\nChapter 1 is amended as follows:\n(a)\nRow 1.5 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.5\nMinced meat and meat preparations made from poultry meat intended to be eaten cooked\nSalmonella\n5\n0\nAbsence in 25 g\nEN/ISO 6579\nProducts placed on the market during their shelf-life’\n(b)\nRow 1.9 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.9\nMeat products made from poultry meat intended to be eaten cooked\nSalmonella\n5\n0\nAbsence in 25 g\nEN/ISO 6579\nProducts placed on the market during their shelf-life’\n(c)\nRow 1.24 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.24\nDried infant formulae and dried dietary foods for special medical purposes intended for infants below 6 months of age\n(14)\nCronobacter\nspp.\n(Enterobacter sakazakii)\n30\n0\nAbsence in 10 g\nISO/TS 22964\nProducts placed on the market during their shelf-life’\n2.\nIn footnote 4 of Chapter 1 the following indent is added:\n‘—\nfood grade salt’\n3.\nPart 2.2. of Chapter 2 is amended as follows:\n(a)\nRow 2.2.1 is replaced by the following:\n‘2.2.1\nPasteurised milk and other pasteurised liquid dairy products\n(4)\nEntero-bacteriaceae\n5\n0\n10 cfu/ml\nISO 21528-2\nEnd of the manufacturing process\nCheck on the efficiency of heat-treatment and prevention of recontamination as well as the quality of raw materials’\n(b)\nFootnote (2) is replaced by the following:\n‘\n(2)\nFor points 2.2.1, 2.2.7, 2.2.9 and 2.2.10 m=M’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

(3) The report of the Ecofin Council on statistical requirements in economic and monetary union, approved on 18 January 1999, outlined in particular the need for common and harmonised short-term public finance statistics for Member States, in particular those who belong to economic and monetary union.

(6) Priority should be given to components representing reliable predictors of trend in public finance and regularly available on time.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine animals and swine and fresh meat from third countries (1), as last amended by Directive 83/91/EEC (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas Directive 83/91/EEC has extended the scope of the basic Directive 72/462/EEC in that for the purposes of Article 3 fresh meat of cloven-hoofed wild animals and wild solipeds, in so far as this concerns permitted importation from certain third countries of origin, is now included;
Whereas it is necessary to amend the Annex to Council Decision of 21 December 1976 drawing up a list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of bovine animals, swine and fresh meat (3), as last amended by Commission Decision 79/560/EEC of 4 May 1979 (4), so as to take account, in respect both of animals and fresh meat, of the criteria set out in Article 3 (2) of the Directive;
Whereas Belize may be considered as complying with these criteria as regards fresh meat of bovine animals and domestic solipeds and must therefore be added to the list;
Whereas, at the present time, the Member States do not authorize the importation of fresh meat of wild solipeds; whereas, therefore, the list should be extended solely to include meat from wild cloven-hoofed animals;
Whereas, while respecting the limitations arising from the adoption of the list, imports of meat of wild cloven-hoofed animals shall continue to be subject to national provisions in respect of health and veterinary inspection; in so far as they are not already subject to any Community health protection measures;

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo) (1), and in particular Article 12(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In the Annex to the French version of Commission Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU (2), several references are made to protocols of agreement to be signed with the Member States on whose territory the centres or stations are located. However, these are in fact not protocols of agreement but agreements.
(2) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU provides for the setting-up of a centre to monitor the security of the system and the services provided, known as the ‘Galileo Security Centre (GSMC)’. The French version of the Annex to the Decision specifies that the creation of this centre will be the subject of protocols of agreement between France and the United Kingdom to be signed during 2012.
(3) In fact, the protocols of agreement between France and the United Kingdom for the creation of the Galileo Security Centre were not signed in 2012, but agreements should be signed in 2013.
(4) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU also provides for the development of a ‘GNSS service centre (GSC)’ in Madrid, to act as the interface between the system, on the one side, and the users of the open service, the commercial service and the Safety of Life Service on the other. The French version of the Annex to the Decision specifies that the creation of this centre was the subject of a protocol of agreement signed with Spain on 17 March 2011.
(5) In fact, the text signed on 17 March 2011 was not a protocol of agreement but merely a memorandum of understanding. The development of the GSC should, however, be the subject of an agreement with Spain in 2013.
(6) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU also provides for the development of a centre, known as the ‘Galileo performance centre’, which, on behalf of the programme manager and independently of the user, evaluates the quality of the services provided and communicates time and geodetic references to the user communities.
(7) For reasons relating to the nature of the functions of the Galileo performance centre, the name of the centre as shown in the Annex to Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU should be amended to ‘Galileo reference centre’ (‘GRC’). Furthermore, in the light of the presence of existing installations and equipment suitable for the tasks assigned to the Galileo reference centre, the security needs, and the technical and budgetary constraints linked to its operation, it would seem that the ESTEC site in Noordwijk, in the Netherlands, owned by the European Space Agency, is best placed to host the centre. It must be pointed out that the Galileo reference centre should not overlap with the instruments already in place in the Member States. Lastly, the development of the centre will not be completed in 2014 but only in 2016.
(8) Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU further provides for the creation of a series of Galileo distance survey centres, known as ‘GSS stations’ which, to allow the provision of services, carry out pseudo-distance measuring and collect the signals sent by the satellites to monitor their quality. The optimum distribution around the globe of these stations should take account of geographical limitations.
(9) The series of GSS stations does not include any stations in the North Pacific area. As it is essential that this area also be covered, a GSS station should be set up there. The said station is planned for Tokyo, in Japan, in the Belgian embassy, should the results of the feasibility studies prove positive.
(10) The Annex to implementing Decision 2012/117/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008,","{'header': '8.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 156/15', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 6 June 2013\namending the annex to Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU establishing a list of key decision points to evaluate the implementation of the Galileo programme with regard to the ground-based centres and stations to be created as part of the programme development and deployment\n(2013/271/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In the Annex to the French version of Commission Implementing Decision 2012/117/EU(2), several references are made to protocols of agreement to be signed with the Member States on whose territory the centres or stations are located.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 2 May 1985
concerning an application for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of certain acrylic fibres originating in the United States of America
(Only the Italian text is authentic)
(85/256/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 16 thereof,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) On 3 May 1980 the Council, by Regulation (EEC) No 1100/80 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain acrylic fibres originating in the United States of America. The rate of the duty is 13,7 % on discontinuous acrylic fibre falling within Common Customs Tariff subheading ex 56.01 A and corresponding to NIMEXE code 56.01-15 and 17,6 % on continuous filament tow of acrylic fibre falling within Common Customs Tariff subheading ex 56.02 A and corresponding to NIMEXE code 56.02-15.
(2) On 28 February 1983 and on 2 August 1984 the Council, by Regulations (EEC) No 485/83 (3) and (EEC) No 2275/84 (4), amended Regulation (EEC) No 1100/80 by excluding from the application of the duty two American exporters of the products in question who offered price undertakings.
(3) On 3 July 1984 and 31 July 1984 Tessile Fiorentina Srl, Prato, Italy, and on 3 April 1984 Lanificio Fratelli Becagli, Montemurlo, Italy, importers of the products in question, applied to the Italian authorities for a refund of amounts of Lit . . . and . . . (5) respectively, in connection with their imports from the USA. These amounts corresponded to definitive anti-dumping duties collected. The Italian authorities forwarded the applications to the Commission.
(4) Following the submission by the applicants of further supporting evidence, the claims were examined by the Commission followed by on-the-spot investigations carried out at the premises of the applicants.
(5) The Commission informed the Member States and gave its opinion on the matter. All Member States agreed with this opinion.
B. Arguments of the applicants
(6) Both applicants stated that they import the products in question from Leigh Fibers Inc., Boston, Mass., an exporter who was investigated during the second review of this case and for whom no dumping was found. The applicants based their claims on the allegation that since no dumping was found concerning this exporter, who has subsequently been excluded from the application of the duty, the duties already paid should be refunded.
C. Admissibility
(7) The applications are admissible since they were introduced in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Community's anti-dumping legislaion, in particular those concerning time limits.
D. Merits of the claim
(8) In its investigation the Commission verified all relevant documents such as exporters' invoices, customs clearance forms, receipts of the duties paid, etc. These were compared with the findings of the review which had been carried out at the premises of the exporter concerned.
(9) It was found that the import transactions for which the importers in question requested refunds took place before Regulation (EEC) No 2275/84, excluding Leigh Fibers, came into effect and that, therefore, the two applicants had to pay the anti-dumping duties.
(10) It was established that the products in question were imported from Leigh Fibers Inc., Boston, Mass., all of whose exports were found, in the review proceeding, not to have been dumped. It was also established that the duties collected on each of the import transactions for which the importers in question requested refunds corresponded to transactions at prices which were not dumped.
(11) Therefore, and in line with present practice, the claims are considered justified and the applications have, thus, to be accepted,","{'title': '85/256/EEC: Commission Decision of 2 May 1985 concerning an application for refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of certain acrylic fibres originating in the United States of America (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe refund applications submitted by Tessile Fiorentina Srl, Prato, Italy, and Lanificio Fratelli Becagli, Montemurlo, Italy, amounting to Lit . . . and Lit . . . respectively, are hereby granted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe amounts set out in Article 1 shall be refunded by the Italian authorities.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic and to Tessile Fiorentina Srl, Prato, Italy, and Lanificio Fratelli Becagli, Montemurlo, Italy.\n\nDone at Brussels, 2 May 1985.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilly DE CLERCQ\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 114, 3. 5. 1980, p. 37.\n\n(3) OJ No L 55, 2. 3. 1983, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ No L 209, 1. 8. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(5) In the published version of the Decision, some figures have hereinafter been omitted, pursuant to the provisions of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 concerning non-disclosure of business secrets.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2238/2000(2), and in particular Article 8 and Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(3), and in particular Article 13 and Article 19(1) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) Definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties were imposed on farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway by Council Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(4) and (EC) No 1891/97(5). The form of the duties set out in these two Regulations was, however, later reviewed, with both regulations being replaced by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1677/2001(7).
(2) At the same time as definitive duties were imposed, individual price undertakings were also accepted from 190 Norwegian exporters by Commission Decision 97/634/EC(8), as last amended by Decision 2001/644/EC(9). By offering undertakings, the companies all agreed to respect certain minimum import prices for their sales of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and to provide the Commission, within due deadlines, periodic reports of their sales to the Community.
(3) However, due to the late receipt by the Commission of one such sales report from the Norwegian exporter Gje-Vi AS, a breach of the terms of the company's undertaking was deemed to have occurred. Acceptance of this company's undertaking was withdrawn by the Commission by Regulation (EC) No 651/98(10), with definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed in its place by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/98(11).
B. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(4) Gje-Vi AS subsequently made a satisfactory request for a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97.
(5) The request contained sufficient evidence of a significant change in circumstances which had occurred since the imposition of duties against its exports to the Community. The company therefore wished to offer again a price undertaking and submitted that, in view of these changes, such an undertaking would be both effective and practicable.
(6) A Notice of initiation of a partial interim review was published accordingly(12). It should be noted in this regard that the review was limited in scope to an examination of whether a new undertaking can be accepted from the company concerned.
C. ACCEPTANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
(7) Details of the procedural aspects and findings of the review investigation are set out fully in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/2002(13).
(8) It is the conclusion of the investigation that the circumstances of Gje-Vi AS have indeed changed since the imposition of anti-dumping and countervailing duties against it and that the new undertaking offered by the company can be accepted.
(9) In this regard, the undertaking now offered by Gje-Vi AS is identical to those previously accepted from Norwegian companies exporting farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway. The company has agreed to respect the minimum import prices laid down therein and to provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, within specified time limits.
(10) As the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission, and it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping and subsidisation, the offer is considered acceptable. The company has been informed of the essential facts, considerations and obligations upon which this acceptance is based.
(11) The name of Gje-Vi AS should therefore be added to the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted in the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC.
(12) The Advisory Committee has been consulted in this regard and has raised no objections.
D. CORRIGENDUM TO DECISION 2001/644/EC
(13) During publication of Commission Decision 2001/644/EC(14), the last amendment to Decision 97/634/EC, the name of the Norwegian company, Janas A/S (UT No 1/75, TARIC Additional Code 8177 ) was inadvertently omitted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted.
(14) Accordingly, the name of this company should be added back into the aforementioned list.
E. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO DECISION 97/634/EC
(15) In view of all the above and for the sake of clarity, an updated version of the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC is published herewith, showing all the exporters whose undertakings are currently in force.
(16) In parallel to this Decision, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 322/2002 has extended the exemption to the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to Gje-Vi AS and corrected the error concerning Janas A/S by amending the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999,","{'title': '2002/157/EC: Commission Decision of 5 February 2002 amending Decision 97/634/EC accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy proceedings concerning imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway (notified under document number C(2002) 389)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Decision 97/634/EC is replaced by the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe insertion of Janas A/S into the Annex to Decision 97/634/EC shall apply with effect from 24 August 2001.\n\nDone at Brussels, 5 February 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 257, 11.10.2000, p. 2.\n\n(3) OJ L 288, 21.10.1997, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 1.\n\n(5) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 19.\n\n(6) OJ L 101, 16.4.1999, p. 1.\n\n(7) OJ L 227, 23.8.2001, p. 15.\n\n(8) OJ L 267, 30.9.1997, p. 81.\n\n(9) OJ L 227, 23.8.2001, p. 49.\n\n(10) OJ L 88, 24.3.1998, p. 31.\n\n(11) OJ L 111, 9.4.1998, p. 10.\n\n(12) OJ C 188, 4.7.2001, p. 11.\n\n(13) See page 1 of this Official Journal.\n\n(14) OJ L 227, 23.8.2001, p. 49.\n\nANNEX\n\nLIST OF COMPANIES FROM WHICH UNDERTAKINGS ARE ACCEPTED\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (1) and in particular Article 91 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 established a single legal framework for EAFRD support for rural development throughout the Community. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 (2) complemented that framework by introducing detailed implementing rules.
(2) Article 57(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 gives details on the implementation of Article 88 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 regarding the application rules on State aids in cases of financial contributions provided by Member States as counterpart of Community support and Article 89 of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 regarding additional national funding outside the scope of Article 36 of the Treaty. It is appropriate to include certain measures relating to forestry in this Article. Moreover, point 9.B of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should be amended accordingly.
(3) Article 63(8) of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 provides details on the exchange of data between the Commission and the Member States in cases of force majeure or exceptional circumstances, and in particular of malfunctioning of the system or a lack of a lasting connection. In order to make full use of available technical tools it is practical to allow the submission of documents by other appropriate electronic means in addition to the submission of hard copies.
(4) Annex V of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 fixes the conversion rates of animals to livestock units as referred to in Article 27(13) of Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006. Regarding the conversion rate for ‘other poultry’ a typing error occurred. In order to take into account the specificities of certain poultry it should be made possible to increase that conversion rate. Annex V should therefore be adapted.
(5) Article 44a of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (3) obliges Member States to ensure annual ex-post publication of the beneficiaries of the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the amounts received by the beneficiary under each of these Funds. Commission Regulation (EC) No 259/2008 of 18 March 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 as regards the publication of information on the beneficiaries of funds deriving from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) (4) provides rules as regards the content, form and date of the publication of information on beneficiaries. The second subparagraph of point 2.1 in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 establishes certain responsibilities for the Managing Authority to publish information about the beneficiaries receiving support from rural development programmes. In order to avoid overlapping provisions on the same subject matter it is appropriate to delete the second subparagraph of point 2.1 in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1974/2006 should be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 2001/89/EC (3) introduces minimum Union measures for the control of classical swine fever, including the measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak of that disease. Those measures include plans by Member States for the eradication of classical swine fever from a feral pig population and the emergency vaccination of feral pigs under certain conditions.
(2) The measures provided for in Directive 2001/89/EC have been implemented by Commission Decision 2008/855/EC (4) that was adopted in response to the occurrence of classical swine fever in certain Member States. That Decision establishes disease control measures concerning classical swine fever in areas of those Member States where that disease is present in feral pigs in order to prevent the spread of the disease to other areas of the Union. The Member States or areas thereof concerned by those measures are set out in the Annex to that Decision.
(3) Decision 2008/855/EC has been amended several times in response to the evolving classical swine fever epidemiological situation in the Union. In recent years the disease situation has improved significantly in the Union and now few areas with specific problems related to specific common risks for classical swine fever can be identified.
(4) It is appropriate that one list sets out the areas of the Member States where the epidemiological situation of classical swine fever is generally favourable in pig holdings and the situation is also improving in the feral pig population.
(5) In terms of risk and as a general rule, since the movement of live pigs and their semen, ova and embryos from infected areas or areas with an uncertain epidemiological situation poses higher risks than the movement of fresh pigmeat, and meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of pigs, movement of live pigs and their semen, ova and embryos from the listed areas should be prohibited. However, it is appropriate to provide for the conditions under which, by way of derogation, live pigs could be dispatched to slaughterhouses or to holdings located outside the listed areas in the same Member State.
(6) In addition, it is appropriate, in order to prevent the spread of classical swine fever to other areas of the Union, to provide that the dispatch of fresh pigmeat, and meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of pigs kept in holdings located in the listed areas is subject to certain conditions. In particular, those pigmeat, meat preparations and products that either do not come from pigs kept in holdings that meet certain additional conditions concerning classical swine fever prevention or are not treated in a way that eliminates the classical swine fever risk in accordance with Article 4 of Council Directive 2002/99/EC (5) should be obtained, handled, transported and stored separately, or at different times, from products which do not fulfil the same conditions and then marked with special marks which cannot be confused with the identification mark provided for in Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) and the health mark for fresh pigmeat provided for in Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).
(7) In accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2002/99/EC, certain certification requirements should also be laid down for the dispatch of pigmeat, and meat preparations and meat products consisting of, or containing meat of pigs kept in holdings located in the listed areas that were treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2002/99/EC.
(8) Decision 2008/855/EC has been amended several times. Therefore it is appropriate to repeal that Decision and replace it by this Decision.

Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Council Decision 97/836/EC (1), the Union acceded to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or be used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions (‘Revised 1958 Agreement’).
(2) In accordance with Council Decision 2000/125/EC (2), the Union acceded to the Agreement concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles (‘Parallel Agreement’).
(3) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) replaced the approval systems of the Member States with a Union approval procedure and established a harmonised framework containing administrative provisions and general technical requirements for all new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units. That Directive incorporated UN regulations in the EU type-approval system, either as requirements for type-approval or as alternatives to Union legislation. Since the adoption of that Directive, UN regulations have increasingly replaced Union legislation in the framework of the EU type-approval.
(4) In the light of experience and technical developments, the requirements relating to certain elements or features covered by UN Regulations Nos 3, 7, 13, 19, 23, 37, 38, 41, 43, 45, 48, 50, 51, 53, 55, 59, 75, 78, 86, 98, 99, 106, 107, 110, 112, 113, 117, 119, 123, 128, 129, by UN GTR No 3 with regard to motorcycle braking, and by UN GTR No 4 with regard to the Worldwide Heavy-Duty Certification procedure, need to be adapted.

adopting the programme of ad-hoc modules, covering the years 2013 to 2015, for the labour force sample survey provided for by Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 577/98 of 9 March 1998 on the organisation of a labour force sample survey in the Community (1), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 577/98, it is necessary to specify the elements of the programme of ad-hoc modules covering the years 2013 to 2015.
(2) There is a need for additional sources (2) for certain sectors with high risks of occupational accidents or diseases and other work-related health problems but which usually are not covered, or not fully covered, by national social security systems, such as ‘Fishing and aquaculture’ (division 03 of NACE rev. 2), ‘Mining and quarrying’ (section B of NACE rev. 2) or ‘Human health and social work activities’ (section Q of NACE rev. 2).
(3) A new ad-hoc module on accidents at work and work-related health problems will provide considerable value added to the information obtainable from the European Statistics on Accidents at Work (ESAW) and European Occupational Diseases Statistics (EODS), allowing, in particular, the data on accidents and occupational diseases to be directly linked to the situation of persons on the labour market and information to be obtained on emerging risks (e.g. work-related health problems not recognised as occupational diseases in national legislation).
(4) The European Employment Strategy fully reflects the need to take into account the labour aspects of immigration, in particular the need to improve the labour market situation of migrants. The Employment Guidelines adopted by Council Decision 2008/618/EC (3), which are an integral part of the ‘Integrated Guidelines Package’, which is designed to spur growth and jobs in Europe as part of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, call for particular attention to be paid to significantly reducing the employment gaps for people at a disadvantage, including the gap between third country nationals and EU citizens. They explicitly state that combating discrimination and integrating immigrants is essential and call for appropriate management of economic migration to improve matching of labour market needs.

The Employment Guidelines adopted by Council Decision 2008/618/EC(3), which are an integral part of the ‘Integrated Guidelines Package’, which is designed to spur growth and jobs in Europe as part of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy, call for particular attention to be paid to significantly reducing the employment gaps for people at a disadvantage, including the gap between third country nationals and EU citizens. They explicitly state that combating discrimination and integrating immigrants is essential and call for appropriate management of economic migration to improve matching of labour market needs. Appropriate data to monitor these issues are extremely important, especially since, given the ageing of the EU labour force and predicted skill shortages, the need for migrant workers will continue to grow in future years.\n\n((5)) In the context of the ongoing debate on flexicurity and the expressed need for greater adaptability of both enterprises and workers in Europe, a key issue highlighted in the European Employment Strategy and the Employment Guidelines, it is necessary to have data from a large-scale European survey on the extent of application of various forms of new work organisation practices and working time arrangements and workers’ experiences with these.\n\n((6)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the European Statistical System Committee,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe programme of ad-hoc modules for the labour force sample survey, covering the years 2013 to 2015, as set out in the Annex, is hereby adopted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nLABOUR FORCE SURVEY\nMultiannual programme of ad-hoc modules\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0ACCIDENTS AT WORK AND OTHER WORK-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS\nList of variables\n: to be defined before December 2011.\nReference period\n: 2013.

(2006/693/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 6(1), Article 8(3), Articles 11 and 12 and the second paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals leaving those zones.
(2) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones (2) provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue.
(3) As soon as the presence of the bluetongue virus is officially confirmed in a holding, Directive 2000/75/EC provides for certain restrictions to be applied in a 20 km radius around the infected holding. Those restrictions include a prohibition on the movement of susceptible animals from and to holdings situated within that radius (the movement ban). The Directive provides for derogations from the movement ban for movements of animals in the protection zone.
(4) It is therefore appropriate to allow movement of animals from holdings affected by the movement ban within the restricted zone for direct transport to a slaughterhouse. Accordingly, Decision 2005/393/EC should be amended to allow for such movements.
(5) Taking into account certain farming practices, it is also appropriate to provide for specific conditions minimising the risk of virus transmission when animals from holdings affected by the movement ban are transferred to specific holdings in the restricted zone from which they can only leave for slaughter. It is also appropriate to amend Decision 2005/393/EC to provide for such conditions.
(6) Article 4 of Decision 2005/393/EC currently provides that domestic movements of animals from a restricted zone for immediate slaughter within the same Member State may be exempted from the exit ban by the competent authority, subject to a case-by-case risk assessment and certain conditions. However, that provision does not currently provide that exemptions from the exit ban are to be linked to a favourable outcome of the risk assessment. It is appropriate and more transparent to require that such exemptions are to be granted following the favourable outcome of the risk assessment.
(7) The exemption from the exit ban for animals leaving the restricted zones for intra-Community trade, currently provided for in Article 5(1) of Decision 2005/393/EC, include animal health conditions for domestic movements to a holding, as laid down in Article 3 of the Decision, and the prior approval of the Member State of destination.
(8) In the interests of consistency, it is appropriate that the animal health conditions laid down in Article 4 of Decision 2005/393/EC for the exemption from the exit ban for domestic movements for slaughter, together with the prior approval of the Member State of destination, also apply to the exemption from the exit ban for animals destined for direct slaughter in another Member State.
(9) The provisions in Annex II to Decision 2005/393/EC relating to the movements of live animals of species susceptible to bluetongue and their semen, ova and embryos from restricted zones should be in line with those conditions laid down in Chapter 2.2.13 of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
(10) Intra-Community trade in frozen semen complying with the conditions set out in Annex II to Decision 2005/393/EC should not require the prior movement approval of the Member State of destination, as post-collection testing verifies beyond doubt the absence of the disease in the donor animal.
(11) France and Germany informed the Commission of the need to adapt the restricted zone related to those Member States. Accordingly, it is appropriate to amend Annex I to Decision 2005/393/EC.
(12) Decision 2005/393/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '14.10.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 283/52', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 13 October 2006\namending Decision 2005/393/EC as regards the conditions applicable to movements from or through restricted zones in relation to bluetongue\n(notified under document number C(2006) 4813)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2006/693/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2000/75/EC lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the Community, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals leaving those zones.\n\n((2)) Commission Decision 2005/393/EC of 23 May 2005 on protection and surveillance zones in relation to bluetongue and conditions applying to movements from or through these zones(2)provides for the demarcation of the global geographic areas where protection and surveillance zones (the restricted zones) are to be established by the Member States in relation to bluetongue.\n\n((3)) As soon as the presence of the bluetongue virus is officially confirmed in a holding, Directive 2000/75/EC provides for certain restrictions to be applied in a 20\xa0km radius around the infected holding.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in view of the possibility of substitution in the bakery industry between starch and quellmehl, the level of the refund to be granted for maize and common wheat used for the production of quellmehl intended for human consumption should be such as to achieve a balance between the cost of supplying the bakery industry with either starch or quellmehl ; whereas this objective could be achieved by fixing the production refund for maize and common wheat for the manufacture of quellmehl intended for use in the bakery industry at the same level as that fixed in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2742/75 of 29 October 1975 for production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2139/77 (6), for the production of starch from maize or common wheat;
Whereas, in view of the situation which will exist as from the beginning of the 1978/79 marketing year, particularly as a result of the increase in Community farm prices for that marketing year, the minimum price paid to the producer of potatoes intended for starch manufacture should be adjusted;
Whereas the aforesaid Regulation provides that a balanced relationship should be maintained between potato starch and maize starch prices and that the production refund should be the same for both products ; whereas, however, in order to maintain this balanced relationship and taking into account the increasing advantage enjoyed by the maize starch industry, particularly because of the by-products obtained from such manufacture, a premium should be paid to potato starch producers;
Whereas, in view of the possibility of substitution in the brewing industry between, on the one hand, starch and, on the other, maize groats and meal and broken rice, the level of the production refund to be granted for maize used by the maize industry in the manufacture of groats and meal for use by the brewing industry in the production of beer and for broken rice used for the same purpose should be such as to achieve a balance between the cost of supplying the brewing industry with either starch, maize groats and meal or broken rice ; whereas this objective could be achieved by fixing the refund for maize intended for the manufacture of groats and meal at the same level as the refund granted for maize for the manufacture of starch and, also, by fixing the refund on broken rice used in the brewing industry at the same level as the refund on broken rice intended for the manufacture of starch,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1127/78 of 22 May 1978 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2742/75 on production refunds in the cereals and rice sectors', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1'}, {'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2742/75 is hereby amended to read as follows:', 'text': 'Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 2742/75 is hereby amended to read as follows:\n\n""Article 1\n\n1.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 404/93 of 13 February 1993 on the common organisation of the market in bananas (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 (2) lays down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 404/93 as regards the quality standards for bananas.
(2) Recent research on banana varieties has led to the development of several hybrids. This is the case of the variety Flhorban 920, a triploide hybrid, Musa balbisiana X Musa acuminata, which belongs to the group AAA. This variety was granted Community protection by Decision No 13757 of the Community Plant Variety Office of 19 July 2004. Hybrids should therefore be covered by Regulation (EC) No 2257/94.
(3) Due to the specific climatic conditions of those regions, Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 allows bananas produced in Madeira, the Azores, the Algarve, Crete and Laconia to be marketed in the Community when classified in Class II even if they do not fulfil the requirement of attaining at least 14 cm in length. It is appropriate to provide for the same derogation for bananas produced in Cyprus, where the climatic conditions are similar.
(4) In view of the demands of the Community market and taking into account the Codex Alimentarius Standard for bananas (Codex Stan 205-1997), provision should be made in order to allow the commercialisation of bananas presented as single fingers.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Bananas,","{'header': '10.2.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 39/7', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 228/2006\nof 9 February 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 2257/94 laying down quality standards for bananas', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2257/94(2)lays down detailed rules for applying Regulation (EC) No 404/93 as regards the quality standards for bananas.\n\n((2)) Recent research on banana varieties has led to the development of several hybrids.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds(1), and in particular Article 15(5) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions, the Committee pursuant to Article 147 of the Treaty and the Committee on Agricultural Structures and Rural Development,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 13 et seq. of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing Single Programming Documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft Single Programming Document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the Single Programming Document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The French Government submitted to the Commission on 17 April 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the region of Lorraine fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. As permitted by Article 40(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 of 17 May 1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF)(2), the draft includes rural development measures other than those referred to in Article 35(1) of the Regulation. It also includes the information listed in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), Guarantee Section.
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 52(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, as an acceptable plan was submitted between 1 January and 30 April 2000 the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible is 1 January 2000 in the case of the Structural Funds. In the case of the EAGGF Guarantee Section, Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2603/1999(3) provides that the expenditure is eligible only if it has actually been paid to the beneficiary after the date of submission of the programme. Under Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.
(6) The rural development measures to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section are governed, in particular as regards their compatibility and consistency with common agricultural policy measures, by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.
(7) The Single Programming Document has been drawn up in agreement with the Member State concerned and within the partnership.
(8) The Commission has satisfied itself that the Single Programming Document is in accordance with the principle of additionality.
(9) Under Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Commission and the Member State are required to ensure, in a manner consistent with the principle of partnership, coordination between assistance from the Funds and from the EIB and other existing financial instruments.
(10) The EIB has been involved in drawing up the Single Programming Document in accordance with the provisions of Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and has declared itself prepared to contribute to its implementation in conformity with its statutory provisions.
(11) The financial contribution from the Community available over the entire period and its year-by-year breakdown are expressed in euro. The annual breakdown should be consistent with the relevant financial perspective. Under Article 7(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, the Community contribution has already been indexed at a rate of 2 % per year. Under Article 7(7) and Article 44(2) of the Regulation, the Community contribution may be reviewed at mid-term, and not later than 31 March 2004, to take account of the effective level of inflation and the allocation of the performance reserve.
(12) Provision should be made for adapting the financial allocations of the priorities of this Single Programming Document within certain limits to actual requirements reflected by the pattern of implementation on the ground, in agreement with the Member State concerned,","{'title': '2002/507/EC: Commission Decision of 22 March 2001 approving the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance under Objective 2 in the region of Lorraine in France (notified under document number C(2001) 628)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Lorraine in France eligible under Objective 2 and qualifying for transitional support under Objectives 2 and 5(b) for the period 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2006 is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2008/106/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on the minimum level of training of seafarers (1) and in particular Article 19(3) thereof,
Having regard to the letter of 13 May 2005 from the Cypriot Authorities, requesting the recognition of Israel in order to recognise certificates of competency issued by this country,
Whereas:
(1) Member States may decide to endorse seafarers’ certificates of competency issued by third countries, provided that the relevant third country is recognised by the Commission as ensuring that this country complies with the requirements of the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (STCW Convention) (2).
(2) Following the request of the Cypriot Authorities, the Commission assessed the maritime education, training and certification systems in Israel in order to verify whether this country complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention and whether appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates. This assessment was based on the results of a fact-finding inspection performed by experts of the European Maritime Safety Agency in March 2007.
(3) Where deficiencies had been identified during the assessment of compliance with the STCW Convention, the Israeli Authorities provided to the Commission the requested relevant information and evidence concerning the implementation of appropriate and sufficient corrective action to address most of these issues.
(4) The remaining shortcomings as regards seafarers’ training and certification procedures mainly concern missing legal provisions in relation to minor aspects of the training provided by the Maritime Education and Training Institutions, the definition of relevant objectives for the application of the Quality Standards System and training requirements regarding personal survival techniques and the use of survival craft. The Israeli Authorities have therefore been invited to implement further corrective action in this respect. However, these shortcomings do not warrant calling into question the overall level of compliance of the Israeli systems regarding education, training and certification of seafarers with the STCW Convention.
(5) The outcome of the assessment of compliance and the evaluation of the information provided by the Israeli Authorities demonstrate that Israel complies with the relevant requirements of the STCW Convention, while this country has taken appropriate measures to prevent fraud involving certificates and should thus be recognised by the Union.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships,","{'header': '29.6.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 161/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 28 June 2010\non the recognition of Israel as regards education, training and certification of seafarers for the recognition of certificates of competency\n(notified under document C(2010) 4227)\n(2010/361/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Member States may decide to endorse seafarers’ certificates of competency issued by third countries, provided that the relevant third country is recognised by the Commission as ensuring that this country complies with the requirements of the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, as amended (STCW Convention)(2).\n\n((2)) Following the request of the Cypriot Authorities, the Commission assessed the maritime education, training and certification systems in Israel in order to verify whether this country complies with the requirements of the STCW Convention and whether appropriate measures have been taken to prevent fraud involving certificates.

Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 of 12 December 1979 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas, by letter dated 29 December 1981, Belgium has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as 'Aminco - Spectrofluorometer, model J 4-8970', ordered 16 November 1978 and to be used for research in the field of biochemistry, enzyme kinetics and the binding of carbohydrates to proteins, specially by the continuous titration of the fluorescence and the kinetics of fast reactions, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin(1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits are to be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs and taking into account all publicly available relevant scientific information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin, including for example opinions of the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures Relating to Public Health, reports from the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) or reports from internationally renowned research organisations.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels at which they may be present in each of the relevant tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue). In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in lactating animals maximum residue limits shall be established for milk.
(4) Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 provides that the establishment of maximum residue limits shall in no way prejudice the application of other relevant Community legislation.
(5) For the purpose of monitoring residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, as the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, maximum residue limits should consequently be established always for muscle or fat tissues.
(6) The substances chlormadinone, flugestone acetate and altrenogest are hormones and are therefore subject to restrictions and control of use as provided for in Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of β-agonists(2). Under certain conditions, these hormones may be administered to farm animals for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes only. In particular, these conditions require the administration of these substances by a veterinarian or under his direct responsibility. In addition, the type of treatment, the types of products authorised, the date of treatment and the identity of the animals treated must be officially recorded by the veterinarian.
(7) Furthermore, the conditions laid down in Directive 96/22/EC prohibit the administration of hormones for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes to breeding animals during the fattening period at the end of their reproductive life. Moreover, they provide that meat or products from animals to which hormones have been administered for therapeutic or zootechnical treatment should not be placed on the market for human consumption unless they have been treated in accordance with Directive 96/22/EC and insofar as the withdrawal period laid down was observed before the animals were slaughtered.
(8) The overall evaluation of the available risk assessments of these substances and of the entire body of available scientific information and data indicate that, as concerns the excess intake of hormone residues and their metabolites, and in view of the intrinsic properties of hormones and epidemiological findings, a risk to the consumer has been identified.
(9) Furthermore, given the intrinsic properties of sexual hormones and as it is not possible to exclude that good veterinary practice is not systematically applied, and that therefore the authorities should be provided with means of control of illegal use of these hormones, Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products(3), requires the authorities to carry out investigations in the case of suspected animals or positive laboratory results.
(10) Taking into account the identified potential adverse effects to human health from the administration of these hormones to farm animals for any purpose and after consideration of the current need to continue to make available on the Community market some of these substances that are currently used for therapeutic or zootechnical treatment of farm animals and, taking also into account the strict conditions under which Directive 96/22/EC authorises the use of these substances for therapeutic or zootechnical purposes, it is appropriate to proceed with the consideration of these substances under Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 for the purpose of setting up maximum residue limits.
(11) Provided that there are no grounds for supposing that residues of the substance concerned at the level proposed present a hazard for the health of the consumer, maximum residue limits should be established in Annex I or Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90. However, given the overall evaluation on the risk assessments of sexual hormones, as concerns possible excess intake of hormone residues and their metabolites, a possible risk to the consumer needs to be regularly reviewed on the basis of any new scientific evidence.
(12) It is thus considered appropriate, without prejudice to other provisions of Community law, in particular Directive 96/22/EC, that chlormadinone and flugestone acetate (for ovine milk) be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and that, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, altrenogest and flugestone acetate (for caprine milk) be inserted into Annex III thereto.
(13) However, it has to be stressed that, as a result of new information or a re-assessment of existing information, Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 can be amended in order to protect human or animal health, in accordance with the procedures provided for in this Regulation.
(14) The Standing Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products referred to in Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 has not delivered a favourable opinion on the Commission proposed measures,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 2584/2001 of 19 December 2001 amending Annexes I and III of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnexes I and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 are hereby amended as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply from the sixtieth day following that of its publication.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 2001.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on materials and articles intended to come into contact with food and repealing Directives 80/590/EEC and 89/109/EEC (1), and in particular Article 5(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) To avoid risks to human health and barriers to the free movement of goods, Commission Directive 2002/16/EC of 20 February 2002 on the use of certain epoxy derivatives in materials and articles intended to come into contact with food (2), lays down specific migration limits for 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ether (‘BADGE’ i.e. Bisphenol-A DiGlycidyl Ether), bis(hydroxyphenyl)methane bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)ethers (‘BFDGE’ i.e. Bisphenol-F DiGlycidyl Ether) and novolac glycidyl ethers (NOGE) and some of their derivatives.
(2) Directive 2002/16/EC provides that the use and/or the presence of BFDGE and NOGE may only be continued until 31 December 2004. For BADGE the transitional period was extended until 31 December 2005 pending the expected submission of new toxicological data and their evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority).
(3) The toxicological data required for BADGE have been transmitted. The Authority concluded that BADGE, BADGE.H2O and BADGE.2H2O do not raise concern about carcinogenicity and genotoxicity in vivo and that a Tolerable Daily Intake of 0,15 mg/kg body weight can be established for BADGE, BADGE.H2O and BADGE.2H2O. Therefore a higher specific migration limit SML(T) can be established for BADGE BADGE.H2O and BADGE.2H2O. As regards the BADGE chlorohydrins, in view of the lack of data on genotoxicity in vivo, the Authority considers that the current specific migration limit of 1 mg/kg of food or food simulants remains appropriate.
(4) Trade in and use of materials and articles containing BADGE in accordance with this Regulation shall therefore be permitted throughout the Community as from 1 January 2006.
(5) The toxicological data required for NOGE and BFDGE have not been transmitted on time to permit their evaluation by the Authority and to continue their use. Therefore the use and/or presence BFDGE and NOGE is no longer permitted as from 1 January 2005 in accordance with Directive 2002/16/EC. However the exhaustion of existing stocks should be permitted.
(6) For large containers, the use and/or presence of BADGE, NOGE and BFDGE are permitted. The high volume/surface area ratio, the repeated use over their long lifetime which reduces migration and the fact that contact with food usually occurs at ambient temperature suggests that it is not necessary to set a migration limit for BADGE, NOGE and BFDGE used in such containers.
(7) Pursuant to Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1935/2004 materials and articles covered by specific measures are to be accompanied by a written declaration stating that they comply with the rules applicable to them. That requirement has not yet been included in Directive 2002/16/EC. Therefore it is necessary to introduce this obligation and to provide for a transitional period.
(8) Having regard to the amendments required and in the interest of clarity, Directive 2002/16/EC should be replaced by a new Regulation.
(9) Directive 2002/16/EC provides that its requirements concerning BADGE, BFDGE and NOGE do not apply to materials and articles brought into contact with food before 1 March 2003. Those materials and articles may continue to be placed on the market provided that the date of filling appears on them. This date may be replaced by the ‘best before’ date as provided for by Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of food (3) or another indication, such as the lot number required by Council Directive 89/396/EEC of 14 June 1989 on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs (4) for the food packed in such materials and articles, provided a link is established between this indication and the date of filling so that the latter can always be identified.
(10) Directive 2002/16/EC should therefore be repealed.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '19.11.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 302/28', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1895/2005\nof 18 November 2005\non the restriction of use of certain epoxy derivatives in materials and articles intended to come into contact with food\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) To avoid risks to human health and barriers to the free movement of goods, Commission Directive 2002/16/EC of 20 February 2002 on the use of certain epoxy derivatives in materials and articles intended to come into contact with food(2), lays down specific migration limits for 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ether (‘BADGE’ i.e. Bisphenol-A DiGlycidyl Ether), bis(hydroxyphenyl)methane bis(2,3-epoxypropyl)ethers (‘BFDGE’ i.e. Bisphenol-F DiGlycidyl Ether) and novolac glycidyl ethers (NOGE) and some of their derivatives.\n\n((2)) Directive 2002/16/EC provides that the use and/or the presence of BFDGE and NOGE may only be continued until 31 December 2004.

Whereas the amendment to the said programme relates only to investments for the modernization, rationalization and creation of wine-making facilities; whereas all these investments may help to improve the situation in the wine sector and further its development; whereas they therefore constitute a programme within the meaning of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77;
Whereas investments in the modernization or creation of grape intake facilities and fermenting rooms and of the acquisition of wine making and other ancillary equipment may not, however, be financed under that Regulation if the type and quality of the wine in question is such that prospects for its disposal are not reasonable or if capacity will be increased;
Whereas the amendment demonstrates that, the criteria adopted by the Commission for the choice of projects to be financed pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 355/77 and notably point 16 of Section B 3 (5) notwithstanding, financing should be allowed pursuant to the Regulation of investments in the modernization or creation of grape intake facilities and fermenting rooms and in the acquisition of wine making and ancillary equipment for the production of quality wines psr the average price of which does not exceed three times the guide price in

Whereas the amendment contains sufficient information, as required in Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 355/77, to show that the objectives of Article 1 of the Regulation can be achieved in respect of the wine sector; whereas the schedule for implementation of the amendment does not exceed the time limit laid down in Article 3 (1) (g) of the Regulation;

THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) Since 1971, the Union has granted trade preferences to developing countries in the framework of its Generalised Scheme of Preferences (‘GSP’). The GSP has been implemented through successive Regulations applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences (‘the scheme’) with periods of application usually of three years at a time.
(2) The current scheme was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 (2) and applies until 31 December 2011. This Regulation should ensure that the operation of the scheme continues to apply after that date.
(3) Future improvements to the scheme should be based on a Commission proposal for a new regulation (‘the next Regulation’) which should take into account relevant considerations relating to the effectiveness of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 in achieving the objectives of the scheme. The next Regulation should include the necessary amendments to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the scheme. It is also essential that the Commission’s proposal take into account statistical trade data, which only became available in July 2010, on imports covered by the scheme for the period including 2009, a year marked by a sharp fall in global trade including that of developing countries. It is equally important to ensure that economic operators and beneficiary countries be given adequate notice of the changes to be brought about by the next Regulation. For those reasons, the remaining period of application of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 is insufficient to allow for the Commission to draw up a proposal and the subsequent adoption of the next Regulation in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. It is however desirable to ensure continuity in the operation of the scheme beyond 31 December 2011 until such time as the next Regulation is adopted and applies.
(4) The period of extension of Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 should not be open-ended. Consequently, and in order to provide the time needed for the legislative procedure for the adoption of the new scheme, the period of application of that Regulation should be extended until 31 December 2013. In case the next Regulation becomes applicable before that date, the period of extension should be correspondingly shortened.
(5) Some technical amendments to Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 are necessary to ensure coherence and continuity in the operation of the scheme.
(6) Developing countries which fulfil the criteria for being eligible for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance (GSP+) should be able to benefit from the additional tariff preferences under that arrangement if, upon their request by 31 October 2011 or 30 April 2013, the Commission decides to grant them the special incentive arrangement by 15 December 2011 or 15 June 2013 respectively. Developing countries which have already been granted benefits under the special incentive arrangement as a result of Commission Decisions 2008/938/EC of 9 December 2008 on the list of the beneficiary countries which qualify for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance, provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 (3), and 2010/318/EU of 9 June 2010 on the beneficiary countries which qualify for the special incentive arrangement for sustainable development and good governance for the period from 1 July 2010 to 31 December 2011, as provided in Council Regulation (EC) No 732/2008 (4) should retain that status during the extension of the current scheme.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),

Whereas, when the guide prices for the various types of table wine are fixed, account should be taken both of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution which the Community wishes to make to the harmonoius development of  world trade; whereas the main objectives of the common agricultural policy are to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to assure the availability of supplies and to ensure that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices;
Whereas until now the guide prices have been set at differing levels for white and for red wines in order to reflect differing market prices; whereas since prices have moved closer together this difference in levels is no longer justified; whereas,  furthermore, it occasions unwarranted vinification practices and the delivery of disproportionate volumes of
red wine for distillation; whereas ist should therefore be
eliminated by lowering the guide price for red wine of types
R I and R II and increasing that for white wine of type A I by such amounts that the mean financial impact on both producers and the Community budget is nil; whereas, however, it is necessary to avoid excessively large price changes by effecting the  elimination over two wine years;
Whereas the level of prices in Spain differs from that of the common prices; whereas, pursuant to Article 70 of the Act of Accession, the Spanish prices should be aligned on the common prices at the beginning of each marketing year; whereas the rules  laid down for this alignment give the Spanish prices set out below;

(3) The importance of checks on the authenticity of coffee extracts as a means of combating fraud and adulteration has resulted in international standardisation work undertaken by the ISO. The Community is participating in this work, which has resulted in ISO standards for soluble coffee.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), as last amended by Directive 97/57/EC (2), and in particular Article 6 (1) and the fourth subparagraph of Article 8 (2) thereof,
Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1199/97 (4), has laid down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8 (2) of Directive 91/414/EEC (hereinafter referred to as 'the Directive`); whereas, pursuant to that Regulation, Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95 (6), laid down the list of active substances of plant protection products to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to the Directive;
Whereas those active substances should be included in that Annex when it may be expected that there will not be any harmful effects on human or animal health or on groundwater or any unacceptable influence on the environment;
Whereas such inclusion should be made for a period not exceeding 10 years;
Whereas the Directive, at Article 8 (2), provides that after inclusion of an active substance in Annex I to the Directive, Member States shall, within a prescribed period, grant, vary or withdraw, as appropriate, the authorizations of the plant protection products containing the active substance; whereas, in particular, Articles 4 (1) and 13 (1) of the Directive require that plant protection products are not authorized unless account is taken of the conditions associated with the inclusion of the active substance in Annex I and the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI on the basis of a dossier satisfying the data requirements laid down in Article 13;
Whereas for imazalil the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92, for a number of uses proposed by the notifiers; whereas Belgium, acting on behalf of Luxembourg as designated rapporteur Member State pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 933/94, has submitted to the Commission on 15 July 1996 the relevant assessment report;
Whereas the submitted report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on Plant Health; whereas this review has been finalized on 11 July 1997 in the format of the Commission review report for imazalil, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92; whereas it may be necessary to update this report from time to time to take into account technical and scientific developments; whereas in such case the conditions for the inclusion of imazalil in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC will also need to be amended pursuant to Article 6 (1) of that Directive;
Whereas it has appeared from the assessments made that plant protection products containing the active substance concerned may be expected to satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5 (1) (a) and (b) of the Directive, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined; whereas therefore it is necessary to include the active substance concerned in Annex I, in order to ensure that, in all Member States, the granting, varying or withdrawing, as appropriate, of the authorizations of plant protection products containing the active substance concerned can be organized in accordance with the provisions of the Directive, and to ensure that this activity is not further delayed;
Whereas before inclusion a reasonable deadline is necessary to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to the new requirements which will result from the inclusion; whereas moreover after inclusion a reasonable period is necessary for the Member States to implement the Directive and in particular to vary or withdraw, as appropriate, existing authorizations or grant new authorizations in accordance with the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC; whereas a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete Annex III dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Annex VI to the Directive; whereas, however, for plant protection products containing several active substances, the complete evaluation on the basis of the uniform principles can only be carried out when all the active substances concerned have been included in Annex I to the Directive;

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 25 October 1989
terminating the review of anti-dumping measures applying to imports of certain synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn originating in Turkey and confirming the expiry of the said measures
(89/568/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1) and in particular Articles 9 and 15 thereof,
Following consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the said Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Previous proceeding
(1) On 15 April 1983 the Commission published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities initiating an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn originating in Turkey (2).
By its Decision 84/131/EEC (3) the Commission accepted a price undertaking offered by AK-PA Ihracat Pazarlama AS as exporter for AK-SU Iplik ve Dokuma ve Boya Apre Fabrikalari TAS, AK-AL Tekstil SanayĂŹl AS and Emboey-Yuentas Birlesik Kamgarn ve Straygarn Iplik Imalciligi AS, all of Istanbul, Turkey, and terminated the proceeding without imposing anti-dumping duties.
In September 1988 the Commission published a notice announcing the imminent expiry of the undertakings in question (4) pursuant to Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.
B. Request for review and reopening of the proceeding
(2) In September 1988 the Commission received a request for a review lodged by the Committee of the Wool Textile Industry of the EEC (Interlaine) on behalf of Community producers representing the major part of Community production. The request claimed that the undertakings given were insufficient, in that other exporters not covered by the anti-dumping measures had increasingly dumped synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn on the Community market, thus undermining the effects of the price undertakings and causing further injury to the Community industry. The evidence relating to dumping and injury was considered sufficient to warrant a review (5), and the Commission accordingly opened an investigation, during which the parties concerned were able to make known their views and provide all information needed for the determination of dumping and injury. In accordance with Article 15 of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 the undertakings given by the Turkish exporters remained in force pending the outcome of the investigation.
C. Products
(3) The products concerned are yarns of synthetic staple fibres (other than sewing thread) put up for retail sale of synthetic staple fibres containing 85 % or more by weight of synthetic textile fibres or containing less than 85 % by weight of such fibres, falling within CN codes ex 5511 10 00 and ex 5511 20 00.
D. Investigation
(4) During the investigation the Commission was able to obtain only limited cooperation from Community producers. The Commission accordingly informed the Committee of the Wool Textile Industry of the EEC, by letter dated 5 July 1989, that it had no evidence enabling it to conclude that the expiry of the anti-dumping measures concerning imports of certain synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn originating in Turkey was liable to result in further material injury or the threat of injury to Community producers.
E. Withdrawal of request for review
(5) By letter dated 11 July 1989 the complainant withdrew its request for review.
F. Termination
(6) The Commission accordingly considers that the review should be terminated and that the undertakings which remained in force pending the outcome thereof should expire immediately,","{'title': '89/568/EEC: Commission Decision of 25 October 1989 terminating the review of anti-dumping measures applying to imports of certain synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn originating in Turkey and confirming the expiry of the said measures', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe review of anti-dumping measures concerning imports of synthetic fibre hand-knitting yarn originating in Turkey is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe undertakings given by the Turkish exporters, which remained in force pending the outcome of the review, shall expire on 25 October 1989.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 October 1989.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No C 102, 15. 4. 1983, p. 2.\n\n(3) OJ No L 67, 9. 3. 1984, p. 60.\n\n(4) OJ No C 249, 23. 9. 1988, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ No C 42, 21. 2. 1989, p. 2.'}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION of 23 November 1981 on a Belgian Government proposal to aid certain investments in a refinery at Antwerp (Only the Dutch and French texts are authentic) (81/984/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments as provided for in Article 93,
Whereas:
I
The Belgian Law of 17 July 1959, implemented by the Royal Order of 17 August 1959 (1), introduced general measures to aid the Belgian economy and in particular interest rate rebates on loans contracted to pay for investments, State guarantees covering loans contracted by undertakings with banks where certain interest rebates are given, and exemption for five years tax on income from immovable property.
When examining the Belgian Law, pursuant to the procedure defined in Article 93 (1) and (2) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission pointed out that, since it contained no industrial or regional objectives and permitted aid to be given for investment by any firm in any area or industry, it constituted a general aid system which, as such, could not qualify for exemption under Article 92 (3) (a) or (c). In the absence of such specific references, the Commission could not assess the scheme's effects on trade between Member States or on competition and was, therefore, unable to form an opinion as to its compatibility with the common market.
It is now the well-established policy of the Commission to accept such general aid schemes subject to one of two conditions, namely that the Member State concerned informs the Commission of either a regional or sectoral plan of application or where this is felt not to be possible, that it notifies significant individual cases of application.
Commission Decision 75/397/EEC (2) required the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium to notify the Commission in advance and in sufficient time of significant cases of application of the Belgian Law of 17 July 1959 introducing measures to promote economic expansion and the creation of new industries, so as to enable the Commission to decide on the compatibility of the proposed aids with the common market.
II
In accordance with this procedure the Belgian Government notified the Commission on 23 February 1981 of its intention of applying the aid provided for under the abovementioned Law to investments to be carried out at a refinery in Antwerp.
The investment would cost Bfrs 6 670 million and mainly involve the installation of catalytic conversion equipment. The overall capacity of the refinery would not be affected but it would be able to convert heavy petroleum fractions into light refined products (motor spirits, naphtha and distillates).
The State aid, to be granted in the form of interest and tax concessions, would amount to some 6 % of the investment.
The refinery in question markets part of its output in Belgium, although over 50 % is exported to other Member States.
III
The refining industry in the Community is still in a difficult situation. In its communications to the Council of 17 March 1977, the Commission pointed out that the industry was facing a two-fold problem : considerable surplus refining capacity and structures relatively ill-adapted to structures of the demand trend.  (1) Moniteur Belge of 29 August 1959. (2) OJ No L 177, 8.7.1975, p. 13.
As regards the latter, the rise in the price of crude petroleum and the measures taken to develop alternative sources of energy have in fact caused and will continue to cause a substantial reduction in the demand for heavy refined products and concurrently make it necessary to convert these products into lighter ones, for which demand continues to expand. However, the price differential in favour of light products (or crudes giving larger quantities of those products) compared with heavy refined products (or heavy crudes) constitutes a sufficient incentive and as a rule provides firms with the funds needed to build such conversion plants. Assistance towards building these plants can therefore only be warranted where genuinely necessary on account of the recipient firm's financial position and where it does not run counter to the aim of reducing capacity by indirectly supporting the maintenance of surplus refining capacity in the Community.
The turnover and profits attained by the refinery in question do not give reason to believe that the aid is absolutely necessary to the investment ; in their comments submitted under the procedure of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty, the Belgian authorities themselves acknowledged that even if the request for aid were turned down, the cracking equipment would be installed, at least in part.
The Belgian authorities also pointed out in their comments that the investment would not only maintain the jobs of 336 persons, but would also lead over the next few years to the recruitment of several hundred workers in the district bordering on the Turnhout area, which qualifies for regional assistance and where the rate of unemployment is particularly high. However, this knock-on effect is by no means assured and at this juncture the effect of the aid on the employment situation in the Turnhout area cannot be assessed.
IV
The aid proposed by the Belgian Government is therefore likely to affect trade between Member States and distort or threaten to distort competition by favouring the undertaking in question or the production of its goods within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty.
The terms of the Treaty provide that aids fulfilling the criteria set out in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty shall be incompatible with the common market. The exemptions from this incompatibility set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty specify objectives to be pursued in the Community interest and not that of the individual beneficiary. These exemptions must be strictly construed in the examination both of regional or sectoral aid schemes and of individual cases of application of general aid systems. In particular, they may be granted only when the Commission can establish that this will contribute to the attainment of the objectives specified in the derogations, which the recipient firms would not attain by their own actions under normal market conditions alone.
To grant an exemption where there is no compensatory justification would be tantamount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any benefit in terms of the interest of the Community, while at the same time accepting that undue advantages accrue to some Member States.
When applying the principles set out above in its examination of individual cases of application of general aid systems, the Commission must be satisfied that there exists on the part of the particular beneficiary a specific compensatory justification in that the grant of aid is required to promote the attainment of one of the objectives set out in Article 92 (3). Where such evidence cannot be provided and especially where the aided investment would take place unmodified, it is clear that the aid does not contribute to the attainment of the objectives specified in the exemptions but serves to increase the financial power of the undertaking in question.
In the case in question there does not appear to be such a compensatory justification on the part of the undertaking benefiting from the aid.
The Belgian Government has not been able to provide, nor has the Commission found, any evidence which establishes that the proposed aid meets the conditions justifying one of the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty.
Furthermore, notwithstanding the fact that Belgium is experiencing a high rate of unemployment, with the result that the Commission has granted an exemption to a scheme of aids to employment on the grounds that a serious disturbance exists in the Belgian  economy, it does not follow that every other aid of whatever nature proposed by the Belgian Government may automatically benefit from one of the exemptions specified in Article 92 (3), since each aid notified must be considered on its own merits in the light of the specific criteria laid down.
As far as the exemptions set out in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) are concerned in respect of aids designed to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, it is the case that the Antwerp area continues to enjoy a better socio-economic situation than that of other regions in Belgium ; to the extent to which the general problem of unemployment also exists in Antwerp, it is already provided for under the general scheme to promote employment and there is, therefore, no reason to grant a further exemption in respect of this aid on the grounds that it promote or facilitate the development of that area, a purpose, moreover, for which this aid was not intended.
As regards the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), this investment would be brought about in any event by normal market forces. There is nothing peculiar to the investment in question to qualify it as a project of common European interest or as one designed to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State, which merits exemption under Article 92 (3) (b) from the provision laid down in Article 92 (1) on the incompatibility of aids.
As regards the exemption specified in Article 92 (3) (c) in favour of ""aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities ... where such aid does not adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest"", the proposed assistance does not appear essential to the development of the industry or the firm in question, although it is likely to affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
Since the investment is likely to yield a profit, it could be carried out under normal market conditions alone, which could hence adapt the structures of the industry and the firm concerned to the latest demand trends.
Furthermore, the financial position of the firm in question is essentially no different from that of other Community firms in the industry not receiving specific assistance to build conversion plant which is, however, essential to them.
Even assuming that the firm could not finance the whole of the investment in question without State aid and would in that case have to cut its refining capacity, the aid would still not be warranted. In view of current surplus capacity at Community level, aid contributing to the maintenance of capacity cannot be regarded as being in the Community interest, since it is likely to transfer, without due cause, the burden of the inevitable reductions to other Member States.
In view of the above, the aid proposal of the Belgian Government does not meet the conditions necessary to benefit from any of the exemptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty,","{'title': '81/984/EEC: Commission Decision of 23 November 1981 on a Belgian Government proposal to aid certain investments in a refinery at Antwerp (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium shall not put into effect its proposal, notified to the Commission on 23 February 1981, to grant assistance in respect of certain investments to be carried out in an Antwerp refinery under the Law of 17 July 1959 on the promotion of economic expansion and the creation of new industries.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Kingdom of Belgium shall inform the Commission within two months of the date of notification of this Decision of the measures which it has taken to comply with it.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium.\n\nDone at Brussels, 23 November 1981.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). That list includes aluminium phosphide.
(2) Aluminium phosphide has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product-type 23, products for the control of other vertebrates, as defined in Annex V to that Directive, which corresponds to product-type 20 as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Germany was designated as Rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 23 July 2010 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 27 September 2013, in an assessment report.
(5) It appears from that report that biocidal products used for product-type 23 and containing aluminium phosphide may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve aluminium phosphide releasing phosphine for use in biocidal products for product-type 20.

Whereas the last subparagraph of Article 4 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 stipulates that the Member States must themselves mobilize the funds to cover the expenditure of the Guarantee Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund, hereafter referred to as the 'EAGGF Guarantee Section'; whereas, under the same Regulation, the Commission grants only monthly advances against booking of the expenditure effected by the Member States;
Whereas, with a view to ensuring the proper management of the appropriations entered in the budget of the Communities for the EAGGF Guarantee Section, each paying department or agency must keep accounts relating exclusively to expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section; and whereas in addition, transmission by the Member States to the Commission of various types of data relating to expenditure to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section must be organized;
Whereas, where Member States fail to meet the deadlines agreed for the notification of data relating to expenditure or to ensure the consistency of such data, the Commission must have power to defer accordingly the payment of the advances against booking;

Whereas the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 stipulates that expenditure for October is related to October if made between 1 and 15 October and to November if made from 16 to 31 October; whereas it is preferable to avoid the division of the accounts provided for in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78, in view of their complexity; whereas, accordingly, it should be stipulated that expenditure deriving from September operations is to be treated in the accounts by the paying departments on a basis of 50 % in respect of the first 15 days of October, and the rest, including any adjustments or corrections, in respect of the last 16 days of October;
Whereas procedures for declaration of certain types of expenditure and charges not effected directly by the departments or agencies referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 should be provided for;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 97/69 of 16 January 1969 on measures to be taken for unform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff (1), as last amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2055/84 (2), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas, in order to ensure that the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff is uniformly applied, provisions should be adopted for the tariff classification of digitizers for measuring geometrical dimensions (for example, surface areas, lengths) on graphic documents (for example, technical drawings, surveying documents, electronic circuit diagrams) via manual scanning using a detector which converts the analog values of the points or lines on the document into numerical coordinates, which are then transmitted, for their interpretation, to an automatic data processing machine linked with the digitizer;
Whereas they consist of the following:
- a pad (grid or tablet work surface) beneath the surface of which are attached two emitter coils and steel wires arranged horizontally (x-) and vertically (y-) at intervals of about 2 mm in order to form a grid constituting the coordinate system,
- an electronic control unit (controller) with microprocessor, PROMs and interface,
- a manual detector in the form of a scanner (pen cursor) comprising a receiver coil and a control keyboard;
Whereas the Common Customs Tariff annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 950/68 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 750/87 (4), classifies, among other things, automatic data-processing machines and units thereof in heading No 84.53 and electrical measuring, checking, analysing or automatically controlling instruments and apparatus in heading No 90.28;
Whereas both headings may be taken into consideration for the purposes of classifying the abovementioned devices;
Whereas, although the devices cannot operate unless connected to an automatic data-processing machine, they have an inherent function; whereas they do not therefore satisfy the criteria set out in note 3 (B) to Chapter 84;
Whereas the Explanatory Notes to the Customs Cooperation Council nomenclature exclude from heading No 84.53 machines working in conjunction with an automatic data-processing machine and performing a specific function; whereas, they should be classified on the basis of that inherent function;
Whereas the aforementioned electronic instrument must be classified in heading No 90.28 and, by virtue of Additional Note 2 to Chapter 90, under subheading 90.28 A II b);

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (1) of 15 June 1992, introducing specific measures for the Canary Islands concerning certain agricultural products; and in particular Article 3 (4) and 4 (4) thereof,
Whereas in application of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (2), it is necessary to determine for the eggs and poultrymeat sectors and for the 1992/93 marketing year, on the one hand, the quantities of meat and eggs of the forecast  supply balance which benefit from an exemption for the levy on direct imports from third countries or from an aid for deliveries originating from the rest of the Community, and on the other hand, the quantities of breeding material originating in the  Community which benefit from an aid with a view to developing the potential for production in the archipelago of the Canaries;
Whereas it is appropriate to fix the amount of the aids referred to above for the supply to the archipelago, on the one hand, in meat and eggs, and on the other hand, of breeding material originating in the rest of the Community; whereas these aids must  be fixed taking into account in particular the costs of supply from the world market, conditions due to the geographical situation of the archipelago and the basis of the current prices on export to third countries for the animals or products concerned;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 setting up a network for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable diseases in the Community (1), and in particular Article 6(5) thereof,
After consulting the European Data Protection Supervisor,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2000/57/EC of 22 December 1999 on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) defines events related to communicable diseases to be communicated by competent public health authorities of Member States to the early warning and response system (EWRS) component of the Community network, and sets up general procedures for information exchange on those events, for consultation and for coordination of measures among Member States in liaison with the Commission.
(2) Decision 2000/57/EC also commits competent public health authorities of each Member State to collect and exchange all necessary information on the events on communicable diseases, e.g. by using the national surveillance system, the epidemiological component of the Community network or any other Community collection system.
(3) The prevention and control of communicable diseases is defined in Decision No 2119/98/EC as a range of measures, including epidemiological investigation, taken by competent public health authorities in the Member States to prevent and stop the spread of communicable diseases. These measures cover contact tracing activities and along with any relevant information in the possession of national competent public health authority on an event related to communicable diseases are promptly forwarded to all other Member States and the Commission. Furthermore a Member State, which intends to undertake measures, in principle informs in advance the Community network on the nature and scope of those measures, as well as consults and coordinates those actions with other Member States in liaison with the Commission.
(4) Decision 2000/57/EC should clearly reflect the provisions of Decision No 2119/98/EC in relation with measures taken or intended to be adopted to prevent and stop the spread of communicable diseases.
(5) Furthermore the entry into force of the International Health Regulations (2005) commits the international community to provide a public health response to the international spread of diseases in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.
(6) In occurrence of an event related to communicable disease with a potential EU dimension necessitating contact tracing measures, Members States collaborate with each other in liaison with the Commission through the EWRS in order to identify infected persons and individuals potentially in danger. Such collaboration may involve an exchange of sensitive personal data of confirmed or suspected human cases between Member States concerned by the contact tracing procedure.
(7) The processing of personal data related to health is in principle prohibited by provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (3) and of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (4). In addition Article 11 of Decision No 2119/98/EC states , inter alia, that its provisions shall apply without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC.
(8) For the public health reasons, the processing of such data is covered by the exemption granted by Article 8(3) of Directive 95/46/EC and Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, in so far as it is required for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis and the provision of care or treatment or the management of health-care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under national law or rules established by national competent bodies to the obligation of professional secrecy or by another person also subject to an equivalent obligation of secrecy. Furthermore, Article 23(1) of International Health Regulations (2005), which entered into force on 15 June 2007, provides that the States Parties to the World Health Organisation (WHO) may require for public health reasons, including contact tracing purposes, on arrival or departure, certain data regarding travellers.
(9) In addition the processing of personal data for the purposes of contact tracing should be considered as lawful in so far as it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject, in accordance with Article 7(d) of Directive 95/46/EC and with Article 5(e) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, and also for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, in accordance with, respectively, Articles 7(e) and 5(a) of these Community acts.
(10) The Commission, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the Member States should put in place appropriate safeguards in relation with the processing of personal data for the purpose of contact tracing, in particular concerning the use of derogation from provisions of Directive 95/46/EC and of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, ensuring that they process personal data in the EWRS in compliance with, respectively, Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Directive 95/46/EC.
(11) In particular when communicating personal data within the EWRS with a view to prevent and stop the spread of communicable diseases, the competent public health authorities of Member States and the Commission should ensure that personal data is adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to that purpose as well as not processed for other purposes, and that it is accurate, updated when necessary and kept for no longer than necessary for that purpose; they should also ensure that persons subject to contact tracing are duly informed of the nature of the processing, of the data processed, of the rights to access and rectify data concerning them, unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort, and that appropriate levels of confidentiality and security are put in place within the EWRS to protect the processing of such data.
(12) In its 2007 report (5) on the operation of the EWRS, the Commission stressed the need for the introduction within EWRS of a selective messaging functionality to guarantee an exclusive communication channel only between Member States concerned by specific events related , inter alia, to contact tracing activities. The use of this selective functionality provides appropriate safeguards whenever personal data is communicated through the EWRS and should ensure that, for the implementation of this Decision, only adequate, relevant and not excessive personal data is circulated within the EWRS, in accordance with Article 4(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Article 6(1)(c) of Directive 95/46/EC. For these reasons the use of the selective messaging functionality should be restricted to notifications involving the communication of relevant personal data, in order to be compatible with the obligations of the Member States under Articles 4, 5 and 6 of Decision No 2119/98/EC.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Article 7 of Decision No 2119/98/EC,","{'header': '14.7.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 181/57', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 10 July 2009\namending Decision 2000/57/EC on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(notified under document number C(2009) 5515)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2009/547/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2000/57/EC of 22 December 1999 on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases under Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2)defines events related to communicable diseases to be communicated by competent public health authorities of Member States to the early warning and response system (EWRS) component of the Community network, and sets up general procedures for information exchange on those events, for consultation and for coordination of measures among Member States in liaison with the Commission.\n\n((2)) Decision 2000/57/EC also commits competent public health authorities of each Member State to collect and exchange all necessary information on the events on communicable diseases, e.g. by using the national surveillance system, the epidemiological component of the Community network or any other Community collection system.\n\n((3)) The prevention and control of communicable diseases is defined in Decision No 2119/98/EC as a range of measures, including epidemiological investigation, taken by competent public health authorities in the Member States to prevent and stop the spread of communicable diseases.

The use of this selective functionality provides appropriate safeguards whenever personal data is communicated through the EWRS and should ensure that, for the implementation of this Decision, only adequate, relevant and not excessive personal data is circulated within the EWRS, in accordance with Article 4(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Article 6(1)(c) of Directive 95/46/EC. For these reasons the use of the selective messaging functionality should be restricted to notifications involving the communication of relevant personal data, in order to be compatible with the obligations of the Member States under Articles 4, 5 and 6 of Decision No 2119/98/EC.\n\n((13)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Article 7 of Decision No 2119/98/EC,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nDecision 2000/57/EC is amended as follows:\n1.\nin Article 1(2), the wording ‘information on these events’ is replaced by ‘information on these events and measures intended or adopted in response to those events or indications for such events’;\n2.\nthe following Article 2a is inserted:\n‘Article 2a\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0This Article shall apply to measures implemented in order to trace persons who have been exposed to a source of infectious agents, and who are potentially in danger of developing or have developed a communicable disease of Community relevance according to the criteria laid down in Annex I (hereinafter referred as ‘contact tracing’).\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0When communicating relevant personal data for contact tracing purposes through the early warning and response system, provided that those data are needed and available, competent public health authorities of a Member State shall use the selective messaging functionality which guarantees appropriate data protection safeguards.

Having regard to the request made by the United Kingdom,
Whereas under the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, wood of conifers (Coniferales), including that which has not kept its natural round surface in the case of wood of Pinus L., originating in European third countries may not be introduced into certain  protected zones established in the Community, unless it is accompanied by the certificates prescribed in Articles 7 or 8 of the said Directive, stating that the special requirements laid down for the introduction and the movement of the said wood into  and within these protected zones, are met;
Whereas wood of conifers (Coniferales) originating in Norway, Sweden, Finland or Poland is currently introduced into the Community; whereas in these cases for wood which has been stripped of its bark, or for wood which has undergone kiln drying to below  20 % moisture content expressed as a percentage of dry matter at time of manufacture, achieved through an appropriate time/temperature schedule and so identified by an appropriate mark, phytosanitary certificates are not generally issued in these  countries;
Whereas, in respect of imports from Norway, Sweden, Finland or Poland into the United Kingdom, the Commission has established, on the basis of the information supplied by the United Kingdom, that an officially approved and monitored programme of issuing  a 'Mill certificate of debarking' has been set up to ensure proper debarking and to reduce the risk from harmful organisms; whereas, in the case of imports of wood which has undergone the said kiln drying from the said third countries, the Commission  has established that an officially approved and monitored programme of issuing a 'Kiln drying certificate' will be set up to ensure proper kiln drying and to reduce the risk from harmful organisms; whereas the risk of spreading harmful organisms is  reduced provided that the wood is accompanied by a 'Mill certificate of debarking' or a 'Kiln drying certificate' issued under that programme;
Whereas the Commission will ensure that Norway, Sweden, Finland or Poland make available all technical information necessary to assess the functioning of the Debarking or kiln drying programme;
Whereas this authorization should be granted only to those Member States for which protected zones for harmful organisms infesting coniferous wood are recognized according to Directive 92/76/EEC (3), because only these protected zones in the Community  are exposed to particular plant health risks;

(1) According to Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.
(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.
(3) For certain Union producers of sugar and isoglucose, exports from the Union represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Union. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the EU producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets.
(4) For the 2012/2013 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit initially at 650 000 tonnes, in white sugar equivalent, for out-of-quota sugar exports and 70 000 tonnes, in dry matter, for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand.
(5) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting Union products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particularly favourable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimise the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the reimport or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar, certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations.
(6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product it is not necessary to restrict the eligible destinations for the export of out-of-quota isoglucose.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '9.5.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 123/30', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 394/2012\nof 8 May 2012\nfixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2012/2013 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.\n\n((2)) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006(2).

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (‘the basic anti-dumping Regulation’), and in particular Articles 11(4) and 13(4) thereof, and to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (2) (‘the basic anti-subsidy Regulation’) and in particular Articles 20 and 23(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   MEASURES IN FORCE
(1) The Council, by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 (3) and (EC) No 2597/1999 (4) imposed anti-dumping and countervailing measures respectively on polyethylene terephthalate (‘PET’) film originating, inter alia, in India.
(2) By Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 (5) and (EC) No 1976/2004 (6), the Council extended these measures to PET film consigned from Israel and from Brazil (‘the extended measures’) with the exception of imports produced by one Brazilian company, Terphane Ltda, and one Israeli company, Jolybar Ltd, specifically mentioned in each of those regulations.
(3) On 10 December 2004 (7), the Commission initiated an expiry review of the definitive countervailing measures on the basis of Article 18 of the basic anti-subsidy (see 1st recital) Regulation. The repeal or continuation of the extended measures will depend on the findings of that investigation.
B.   CURRENT INVESTIGATION
1.   Request for a review
(4) The Commission subsequently received a request for an exemption from the extended measures pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20 and 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation. The application was lodged by Hanita Coatings Rural Cooperative Association Ltd, Kibbutz Hanita, 22885, Israel (‘Hanita’), a producer in Israel (‘the country concerned’).
2.   Initiation of a review
(5) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by Hanita and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Articles 11(4) and 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Articles 20 and 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation for the purposes of determining the possibility of granting Hanita an exemption from the extended measures. After consultation of the Advisory Committee, and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Regulation (EC) No 1370/2005 (8), a review of Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 with regard to Hanita.
(6) The Regulation initiating the review repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1975/2004 with regard to imports of the product under investigation consigned from Israel by Hanita. Simultaneously, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, customs authorities were directed to take appropriate steps to register such imports.
3.   Product concerned
(7) The product concerned is, as defined in the original investigation, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India, normally declared under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (‘the product concerned’).
(8) It is considered that the product concerned and PET film consigned from Israel to the Community under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (‘the product under review’) have the same basic technical, physical and chemical characteristics and the same uses. Therefore, they are considered as like products within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 1(5) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation.
4.   Investigation
(9) The Commission officially advised Hanita and the representatives of the country concerned of the initiation of the review. Interested parties were invited to make their views known and informed of the possibility to request a hearing. No such request was, however, received.
(10) The Commission also sent out a questionnaire to Hanita and received a satisfactory reply within the relevant deadline. The Commission sought and verified all the information deemed necessary for the purposes of the review. A verification visit was carried out at Hanita’s premises.
5.   Investigation period
(11) The investigation covered the period from 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2005 (‘the IP’). Data was collected from 2001 up to the end of the IP to investigate any change in the pattern of trade.
C.   RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(12) The investigation confirmed that Hanita did not export the product under review to the Community during the investigation period of the investigation that led to the extended measures, i.e. 1 January to 31 December 2003. Hanita's first exports of the product under review occurred subsequent to the extension of measures.
(13) Furthermore, according to documentary evidence submitted, Hanita was able to satisfactorily demonstrate that it did not have any direct or indirect links with any of the Indian exporting producers or Israeli companies subject to the anti-dumping and countervailing measures in force.
(14) As already mentioned at recital (12), Hanita's exports to the Community of the product under review first occurred after the extension of measures. Hanita converts and slits purchased PET film and produces a range of products, some of which fall under the same CN codes as the product concerned. The PET film processed by Hanita and exported to the Community does not use any inputs from India. It is therefore concluded that this is not a practice constituting circumvention.
D.   AMENDMENT OF THE MEASURES BEING REVIEWED
(15) In accordance with the above findings that Hanita was found not to have circumvented the measures in force, the company should be exempted from the extended measures.
(16) The registration of imports of PET film consigned from Israel by Hanita, as imposed by the initiating Regulation, should cease. In accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation, which provides that measures shall be applied against registered imports from the date of registration, no anti-dumping duty should be collected on imports of PET film consigned from Israel by Hanita which entered the Community under registration imposed by the initiating Regulation.
(17) The exemption from the extended measures granted to PET film produced by Hanita shall, in accordance with Article 13(4) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation and Article 23(3) of the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, remain valid under the requirement that it is not established that the exemption was granted on the basis of false or misleading information submitted by the company concerned. Should prima facie evidence indicate otherwise, an investigation may be initiated by the Commission to establish if withdrawal of the exemption is warranted.
(18) The exemption from the extended measures of imports of PET film from Hanita was established on the basis of the findings of the present review. This exemption is thus exclusively applicable to imports of PET film consigned from Israel and produced by that specific legal entity. Imported PET film produced or consigned by any company not specifically mentioned in Article 1(1) of Regulations (EC) No 1975/2004 and (EC) No 1976/2004 with its name and address, including entities related to those specifically mentioned, cannot benefit from the exemption and should be subject to the residual duty rate as imposed by Regulations (EC) No 1676/2001 and (EC) No 2597/1999.
E.   PROCEDURE

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 89(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1062/2014 (2) establishes a list of active substances to be evaluated with a view to their possible approval for use in biocidal products or inclusion into Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012. That list includes alpha-cypermethrin.
(2) Alpha-cypermethrin has been evaluated in accordance with Article 90(2) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 for use in biocidal products for product-type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(3) Belgium was designated as evaluating competent authority and submitted an assessment report, together with its recommendations, to the Commission on 17 November 2011 in accordance with paragraphs 4 and 6 of Article 14 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 (3).
(4) The opinion of the European Chemicals Agency was formulated on 17 June 2014 by the Biocidal Product Committee, having regard to the conclusions of the evaluating competent authority.
(5) According to that opinion, biocidal products used for product-type 18 and containing alpha-cypermethrin may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve alpha-cypermethrin for use in biocidal products for product-type 18 subject to compliance with certain specifications and conditions.
(7) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approval should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products,","{'header': '12.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 67/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) 2015/405\nof 11 March 2015\napproving alpha-cypermethrin as an active substance for use in biocidal products for product-type\xa018\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1062/2014(2)establishes a list of active substances to be evaluated with a view to their possible approval for use in biocidal products or inclusion into Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.

After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) On 18 February 2000, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding with regard to imports into the Community of certain aluminium foil originating in the People's Republic of China (""the PRC"") and Russia.
(2) Given the need to further examine certain aspects of dumping as well as the impact on the Community industry of the imports concerned, no provisional anti-dumping measures were imposed, additional information was requested and the investigation was continued.
(3) The definitive findings and conclusions of the investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 950/2001(4) imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the PRC and Russia.
B. UNDERTAKING
(4) The sole exporting producer in Russia and its related companies involved in the production, trade and importation into the Community of the product concerned offered an undertaking. According to this undertaking, these companies have offered to sell the product concerned to their unrelated customers in the Community at a minimum price.
(5) The Commission considers that the undertaking offered by the Russian company, Joint Stock Company ""United Company Siberian Aluminium"", Studencheskaya Street, 33/4, Moscow, Russia, and its related companies, namely the production company Sayan Foil, Sayanagorsk, Russia, the export sales company Rual Trade Limited, Suites 7B &  8B, 50 Town Range, Gibraltar and the importing company Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH, Graf-Adolf-Platz 1-2, D-40213, DĂźsseldorf, can be accepted since it eliminates the injurious effects of dumping. Moreover, the regular and detailed reports which these companies undertook to provide to the Commission and the structure of their sales of the product concerned will allow effective monitoring such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking will be limited.
(6) In order to ensure the effective respect and monitoring of the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty should be conditional upon presentation of a commercial invoice containing the information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 950/2001 which is necessary for customs to ascertain that shipments correspond to the commercial documents at the required level of detail. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product concerned presented to customs, the appropriate rate of anti-dumping duty should instead be payable.
(7) In the event of a suspected breach, breach or withdrawal of the undertaking an anti-dumping duty may be imposed, pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation,","{'title': ""2001/381/EC: Commission Decision of 16 May 2001 accepting an undertaking offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People's Republic of China and Russia (notified under document number C(2001) 1446)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking offered by Joint Stock Company ""United Company Siberian Aluminium"", Studencheskaya Street, 33/4, Moscow, Russia, Sayan Foil, Sayanagorsk, Russia, Rual Trade Limited, Suites 7B &  8B, 50 Town Range, Gibraltar, and Sibirsky Aluminium GmbH, Graf-Adolf-Platz 1-2, D-40213, Düsseldorf, in the framework of the anti-dumping proceedings concerning imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the PRC and Russia is hereby accepted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall enter into force the day after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Decision shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 May 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nPascal Lamy\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6.3.1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 257, 11.10.2000, p. 2.\n\n(3) OJ C 45, 18.2.2000, p. 2.\n\n(4) See page 1 of this Official Journal.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data(1), and in particular Article 25(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC Member States are required to provide that the transfer of personal data to a third country may take place only if the third country in question ensures an adequate level of protection and if the Member State's laws implementing other provisions of the Directive are complied with prior to the transfer.
(2) The Commission may find that a third country ensures an adequate level of protection. In that case personal data may be transferred from the Member States without additional guarantees being necessary.
(3) Pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC the level of data protection should be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or a set of data transfer operations and in respect of given conditions. The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under that Directive has issued guidance on the making of such assessments(2).
(4) Given the different approaches to data protection in third countries, the adequacy assessment should be carried out, and any decision based on Article 25(6) of Directive 95/46/EC should be enforced in a way that does not arbitrarily or unjustifiably discriminate against or between third countries where like conditions prevail nor constitute a disguised barrier to trade, regard being had to the Community's present international commitments.
(5) As regards Hungary, the legal standards on the protection of personal data have binding legal effect.
(6) The protection of privacy, particularly with regard to the processing of personal data, is provided for by Article 59 of the Hungarian Constitution. The legal provisions are laid down by Law LXIII of 17 November 1992, which entered into force on 1 May 1993. Various sectoral laws have also incorporated provisions on the protection of personal data in various areas such as statistics, market research, scientific research and health.
(7) With effect from 1 February 1998, Hungary ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention No 108)(3), which aims to reinforce the protection of personal data and to ensure free circulation between the Contracting Parties, subject to any exceptions which these parties may provide for. Without being directly applicable, the Convention lays down the international commitments concerning not only the basic principles of protection which each Contracting Party must implement in its internal law but also the mechanisms of cooperation between the Contracting Parties. In particular, the competent Hungarian authorities must provide the authorities of the other Contracting Parties which so request with any information on the law and administrative practice regarding data protection, and with information on any specific instance of automatic processing of data. They must also assist any person residing abroad in exercising his right to be informed about the existence of processing operations on data concerning him, the right to access his data or to ask for them to be corrected or deleted, and the right of judicial remedy.
(8) The legal standards applicable in Hungary cover all the basic principles necessary for an adequate level of protection for natural persons, even if exceptions and limitations are also provided for in order to safeguard important public interests. The application of these standards is guaranteed by judicial remedy and by independent supervision carried out by the Commissioner appointed by the Parliament pursuant to Law LXIII of 1992. Furthermore, the compensation of persons who have suffered prejudice as a result of unlawful processing is guaranteed by law.
(9) In the interests of transparency and in order to safeguard the ability of the competent authorities in the Member States to ensure the protection of individuals as regards the processing of their personal data, it is necessary to specify in this Decision the exceptional circumstances in which the suspension of specific data flows may be justified, notwithstanding the finding of adequate protection.
(10) The Working Party on Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data established under Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC has delivered opinions on the level of protection provided by Hungarian law which have been taken into account in the preparation of the current Decision(4).
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 31 of Directive 95/46/EC,","{'title': '2000/519/EC: Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 pursuant to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the adequate protection of personal data provided in Hungary (notified under document number C(2000) 2305) (Text with EEA relevance.)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of Article 25(2) of Directive 95/46/EC, for all the activities falling within the scope of that Directive, Hungary is considered as providing an adequate level of protection of personal data transferred from the Community.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision concerns only the adequacy of protection provided in Hungary with a view to meeting the requirements of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC and does not affect other conditions or restrictions implementing other provisions of the Directive that pertain to the processing of personal data within the Member States.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 12(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
1. Original measures
(1) In July 2002, the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty (the original measure) on imports of sulphanilic acid originating, inter alia, in the People's Republic of China by Regulation (EC) No 1339/2002(2). The country-wide duty rate applicable to the net, free-at-Community frontier price, is 21 %.
2. Request for an anti-absorption reinvestigation
(2) On 12 May 2003, a request for a reinvestigation of the measure referred to in recital 1 was lodged pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation. The request was submitted by Sorochimie and Quimigal (the applicants), two producers representing 100 % of the Community production of sulphanilic acid.
(3) The applicants submitted sufficient information showing that the anti-dumping duty imposed on sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China has not led to sufficient movement in the prices in the Community. In fact, the evidence contained in the request showed that export prices and prices delivered (duty unpaid) to final customers in the Community fell significantly following the imposition of the anti-dumping measures, suggesting an increase in dumping which impeded the intended remedial effects of the anti-dumping measures in force.
3. The anti-absorption reinvestigation
(4) On 26 June 2003, the Commission announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union(3) the initiation of a reinvestigation, pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation, of the anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China.
(5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country, importers and users of the initiation of the reinvestigation. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation. The Commission sent questionnaires to all parties known to be concerned.
(6) Two complete questionnaire replies were received from a Chinese exporter, Sinochem Hebei import and export corporation (Sinochem), and from a user importing directly the product concerned from the People's Republic of China, 3V Sigma, Italy (3V Sigma). It has to be noted, that the investigation which led to the imposition of the original measures (the original investigation) established that sulphanilic acid is imported into the Community directly by the final users of this product.
(7) Three other importers/users declared that they would not reply to the questionnaire because they had only imported very marginal quantities of the product concerned during the investigation period. A fourth importer/user submitted some information but stopped cooperating in the course of the investigation.
(8) The investigation period of this reinvestigation (new IP) ran from 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003. The new IP was used to determine the current level of export prices and the level of the prices delivered to the final customer in the Community. In establishing whether the prices in the Community had moved sufficiently, the price levels charged during the new IP were compared to those charged during the original investigation period (original IP) which had covered the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001.
(9) Because of duly justified exceptional circumstances (i.e. the consequences of the SARS epidemic in the People's Republic of China), the cooperating parties requested and were granted extensions to submit their replies. For this reason, the reinvestigation slightly exceeded the normal period of six months provided for in Article 12(4) of the basic Regulation.
B. PRODUCT UNDER CONSIDERATION
(10) The product concerned by the request and for which the reinvestigation was initiated is the same as in the original investigation, i.e. sulphanilic acid, normally classified within CN code ex 2921 42 10 (TARIC code 2921 42 10 60 ). Sulphanilic acid is a chemical product used as raw material in the production of optical brighteners, concrete additives, food colorants and speciality dyes.
C. THE REINVESTIGATION
(11) The purpose of this reinvestigation is, first, to establish whether or not there was a sufficient movement in prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in China further to the imposition of the aforementioned anti-dumping measures. As a second step, where it is concluded that absorption took place, the dumping margin is recalculated. In accordance with Article 12 of the basic Regulation, importers/users and exporters are provided with an opportunity to submit evidence that could justify a lack of movement in prices in the Community following the imposition of measures for reasons other than absorption of the anti-dumping duty.
1. Movement of prices in the Community
1.1. General
(12) As mentioned above, the pattern of trade for sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China is characterised by the absence of intermediaries such as traders importing the product in the Community for resale. Users in the Community, which are generally large chemical companies, directly import the product concerned from the People's Republic of China, for their own internal consumption.
(13) Therefore, in the absence of any resale price in the market, the Community price level during the new IP of the product concerned originating in the People's Republic of China was determined by adding to the cif price in euro at the Community border both the conventional and the anti-dumping duties payable. The cif price in euro at the Community border was established on the basis of information submitted by the aforementioned cooperating Chinese exporting producer and importer/user in the Community. Together, these companies reported data amounting to 1430 tonnes of sulphanilic acid during the new IP, a level exceeding slightly the statistical information available from Eurostat.
(14) The movement of prices in the Community was assessed by comparing, for the same delivery conditions, the average price, including duties, referred to in recital 13, of the new IP with that determined in the original IP, plus the duties. The comparison showed that the average price in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China had decreased by 18,1 %.
(15) It should be noted that the average conventional duty rate applicable to imports of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China declined from 8,5 to 7,4 % between the two IPs. Taking this effect out, the decrease in cif prices in euro between the two IPs was 17,4 %.
1.2. Claims made by interested parties
1.2.1. Exchange rate variation
(16) Several interested parties noted that sulphanilic acid imported from the People's Republic of China is invoiced in US dollars. They indicated that the decrease of export prices and prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid would largely be the result of the USD/EUR exchange rate variation observed between the original IP and the new IP. The claim was verified and it was indeed found that the US dollar had depreciated against the euro by 11,4 % between the original IP and the new IP. Therefore, the claim was accepted. However, even when the comparison is carried out by taking into account the effect of the abovementioned depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, a decrease in the level of prices in the Community by 9,3 % is still observed between the original IP and the new IP.
1.2.2. Transportation costs
(17) A cooperating party alleged that the decrease in transport costs between the People's Republic of China and the Community could explain part of the possible decrease in prices of the product concerned. This claim was verified on the basis of the actual transport costs reported by the cooperating parties themselves. When comparing these transport costs with the ones determined in the framework of the original investigation, it appears that transport costs have marginally increased, and not decreased, between the two IPs. Therefore, the claim was rejected.
1.2.3. Raw material price
(18) Cooperating parties claimed that any possible decrease in the prices of sulphanilic acid would be the consequence of a corresponding decline between the original IP and the new IP in the price of aniline, a key raw material representing some 60 % of the cost of production of sulphanilic acid. It was alleged that the price of aniline would have decreased by some 5 % over the abovementioned period.
(19) This type of claim refers to costs of production, and can only be taken into account in the context of a re-examination of normal value. However, pursuant to Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation, alleged changes in normal value shall only be taken into account where complete information on revised normal values is made available to the Commission. This was not the case. For this reason alone, the claim could already be rejected. However, in order to establish a complete picture of all the elements possibly at stake, the abovementioned allegation was nevertheless examined. To this end, exhaustive information on aniline prices during the new IP was obtained from the same source that had been used in order to determine the normal value in the original investigation, i.e. a cooperating company in the analogue country, namely India. On this basis, it was found that aniline prices had increased, not decreased, by around 6 % between the two IPs. Therefore, even if the claim had been correctly presented in the context of a request for a revision of normal value pursuant to Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation, it would have been considered to be unfounded.
1.3. Conclusion
(20) It was therefore concluded that absorption of the anti-dumping duty had taken place, as the decrease observed in the prices in the Community of sulphanilic acid originating in the People's Republic of China could not be fully justified even after taking into consideration the above described claim concerning exchange rate fluctuations.
2. Reassessment of the export prices
(21) Since it was established that absorption had taken place and that the lack of movement in the prices in the Community was due to a fall in the export prices it was considered appropriate to use the export prices of the new IP, for the purpose of recalculating the appropriate dumping margins in accordance with the last sentence of Article 12(2) of the basic Regulation.
3. Normal value
(22) Article 12(5) of the basic Regulation provides for the possibility of taking alleged changes in normal value into account, where complete information is made available to the Commission within given time limits. As indicated under recital 19, no interested party formally requested a revision of the normal value. Therefore, the normal value as established in the original investigation was used in recalculating the dumping margins.
4. Recalculation of the dumping margin taking account of the export prices observed during the new IP
(23) As required under Article 12 of the basic Regulation, the country-wide dumping margin for the People's Republic of China was recalculated by comparing the average fob price established in the current investigation with the average fob normal value as established in the original investigation. The difference was then expressed as a percentage of the cif value determined in the reinvestigation.
(24) The recalculated dumping margin was found to have increased to 33,7 %, in comparison with 21 % as established in the course of the original investigation.
5. New level of the measure
(25) The original measures were based on the dumping margin.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1095/96 of 18 June 1996 on the implementation of the concessions set out in Schedule CXL drawn up in the wake of the conclusion of the GATT XXIV. 6 negotiations (1), and in particular Article 1 (1) thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to the agreement concluded as part of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade negotiations, the Community undertook to open an annual tariff quota for the importation of 14 000 tonnes of grape juice and must; whereas rules should be drawn up for its use;
Whereas the importation of grape juice and must under the tariff quota qualifies, under specific conditions concerning their use, for exemption from the specific duty determined per hectolitre; whereas equal and continuous access to the quota should, in particular, be guaranteed for all Community importers as should the application without interruption and throughout the Member States of the rates envisaged for this quota to all imports of the products in question until the quota is used up; whereas, in order to take account of the reality of the situation as regards imports over recent years and prevent the quota being used up, the quota should be subdivided over several periods, each with a specific quantity corresponding to trade requirements; whereas use of and compliance with that quota should be controlled by means of a system of import licences; whereas detailed rules should therefore be laid down regarding the submission of applications and the issue of licences;
Whereas, moreover, provision should be made for decisions on import licence applications to be notified after a review period; whereas that period must permit the Commission to consider the quantities applied for and, where appropriate, provide for special measures with regard, in particular, to applications pending;
Whereas the period of validity of the import licences under these arrangements should be more clearly specified with reference to their actual date of issue; whereas, in view of the aforementioned review period, Article 3 should be waived of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3388/81 of 27 November 1981 laying down special detailed rules in respect of import and export licences in the wine sector (2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 257/96 (3), and use should be made of Article 21 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3719/88 of 16 November 1988 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2137/95 (5);
Whereas, in order to administer the arrangements, the Commission requires accurate information of the licence applications submitted and the use of the licences issued; whereas, in the interests of administrative efficiency, provision should be made for the use of a single model for communications between the Member States and the Commission;
Whereas, in order to ensure compliance with the quota rules on the use of the imported grape juice and must, provision should be made for the lodging of a security with the customs authorities of the Member States which should be immediately released proportionately to the quantities for which proof of use is provided;
Whereas each Member State may provide for checks on use in accordance with a national procedure pursuant to Article 487 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1676/96 (7), provided that the goods do not leave its territory before their end use; whereas, where the goods are processed in a Member State other than that of release for free circulation, those checks must be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Whereas, by virtue of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, each Member State is required to produce a harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP) starting with the index for January 1997; whereas the requirement to produce HICPS in no way puts in question the right of Member States to publish their national, non-harmonised, inflation indices, which they may wish to use for national policy purposes;
Whereas Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices (3) set down the initial coverage for HICPs that was restricted to those goods and services covered by all or most national consumer prices indices (CPIs);
Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 1687/98 of 20 July 1998, amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 concerning the coverage of goods and services of the harmonised index of consumer prices (4) defined the coverage of the HICP as those goods and services which are included in household final monetary consumption expenditure;
Whereas Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 requires that the HICP should be based on the prices of goods and services available for purchase in the economic territory of the Member State for the purposes of directly satisfying consumer needs; whereas the weights of the HICP require a harmonised definition of their geographic and population coverage;
Whereas the compilation of the Monetary Union index of consumer prices (MUICP) and the European index of consumer prices (EICP) requires a harmonised geographic concept for the HICPs;
Whereas the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman; whereas, in this case, following the procedure laid down in Article 14(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2494/95, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1688/98 of 20 July 1998 amending Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 concerning the geographic and population coverage of the harmonised index of consumer prices', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1749/96 shall be amended as follows:\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 2003/796/EC (1) established a European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in the Member States, and between these bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal market and ensuring the consistent application in all Member States of Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity (2), Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas (3) and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity (4).
(2) In order to enhance the cooperation between national regulatory bodies and to contribute further towards the effective functioning of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas, an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators was established by Regulation No (EC) 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. (5).
(3) The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators provides a framework within which national regulatory authorities can cooperate and carry out tasks similar to those currently pursued by the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas. As the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators will continue the work undertaken by the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas within the framework of a more effective governance, it is therefore appropriate to repeal Decision 2003/796/EC.
(4) In order to ensure that the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas can finalise several pending projects, the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas should be dissolved only as of 1 July 2011 so to ensure a smooth transition to the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators,","{'header': '17.5.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 129/14', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 16 May 2011\non repealing Decision 2003/796/EC on establishing the European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas\n(2011/280/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Decision 2003/796/EC(1)established a European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in the Member States, and between these bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal market and ensuring the consistent application in all Member States of Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity(2), Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas(3)and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity(4).\n\n((2)) In order to enhance the cooperation between national regulatory bodies and to contribute further towards the effective functioning of the internal markets in electricity and natural gas, an Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators was established by Regulation No (EC) 713/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council.(5).\n\n((3)) The Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators provides a framework within which national regulatory authorities can cooperate and carry out tasks similar to those currently pursued by the European Regulatory Group for Electricity and Gas.

laying down protective measures concerning uses of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid leading to the contamination of drinking water
(notified under document number C(2007) 1865)
(Text with EEA relevance)
(2007/322/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (1), and in particular Article 11(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Tolylfluanid is an active substance included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directive 2006/6/EC (2).
(2) On 23 February 2007 Germany informed the Commission that it has recently been discovered that tolylfluanid can have an unexpected effect on drinking water. Specifically, the use of a certain plant protection product, ‘Eurparen M WG’ which contains tolylfluanid, leads to the formation of a metabolite of tolylfluanid, namely dimethylsulfamide, which is likely to be found in the soil, and in groundwater and surface water. By a standard drinking water preparation process (ozonisation) this metabolite is converted into a nitrosamine (NDMA) which is harmful to health.
(3) Other active substances with a similar molecular structure as tolylfluanid could undergo the same degradation path.
(4) Nitrosamines are suspected or proven genotoxic and carcinogenic substances and their presence in drinking water should therefore be avoided.
(5) Article 11(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that if a Member State has valid reasons to consider that a product which it has authorised or is bound to authorise under Article 10 constitutes a risk to human or animal health or the environment, it may provisionally restrict or prohibit the use and/or sale of that product on its territory. It shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member States of such action and give reasons for its decision.
(6) According to information received, the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Poland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, have already suspended the outdoor use of products containing tolylfluanid.
(7) Article 11(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC provides that a decision is to be taken on the matter at Community level. In this case, urgent measures are needed to ensure that uses of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid do not lead to drinking water contamination. The problem is not limited to a single Member State, because contamination of groundwater or drinking water could have effects across national borders. As set out in its ninth recital, Directive 91/414/EEC aims for a high level of protection of health, groundwater and the environment. The fifth recital to Directive 91/414/EEC shows that it also aims at preventing unnecessary barriers to trade. Unilateral measures by Member States could lead to differing levels of protection, and also hinder trade in plant protection products. As a consequence, it is necessary to adopt measures at Community level.
(8) In the present case, warning through labelling is not sufficient to protect human health.
(9) Additional information should be collected to allow the Commission to review if necessary Directive 91/414/EEC as regards tolylfluanid. It should also be investigated whether the same problems could arise with other substances currently being assessed or already assessed at Community level. As a consequence, each Member State which has been appointed as a rapporteur for assessing an active substance under Directive 91/414/EEC should investigate without delay whether the use of plant protection products containing that substance could lead to similar concerns.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '9.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 119/49', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 4 May 2007\nlaying down protective measures concerning uses of plant protection products containing tolylfluanid leading to the contamination of drinking water\n(notified under document number C(2007) 1865)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2007/322/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Tolylfluanid is an active substance included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC by Commission Directive 2006/6/EC(2).\n\n((2)) On 23 February 2007 Germany informed the Commission that it has recently been discovered that tolylfluanid can have an unexpected effect on drinking water.

Whereas:
(1) Information exchanges between flight data processing systems are established between air traffic control units for the purposes of notification, coordination and transfer of flights and for the purposes of civil-military coordination. These information exchanges should rely upon appropriate and harmonised communication protocols to secure their interoperability.
(2) The European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) has been given a mandate in accordance with Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 to develop requirements for a flight message transfer protocol to be used for the purpose of notification, coordination and transfer of flights. This Regulation is based on the resulting mandate report of 31 March 2005.
(3) The Eurocontrol standard for Flight Data Exchange was annexed to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2082/2000 of 6 September 2000 adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Directive 97/15/EC, adopting Eurocontrol standards and amending Council Directive 93/65/EEC (3), making its use mandatory within the Community in the event of procurement of new flight data processing systems. As Regulation (EC) No 2082/2000 was repealed with effect from 20 October 2005, it is necessary to update Community legislation, so as to ensure the consistency of relevant regulatory provisions.
(4) It is becoming more and more difficult and costly to maintain Communication equipment and software complying with the Eurocontrol standard for Flight Data Exchange. An appropriate new standard to support the exchange of flight data should therefore be adopted.
(5) The Transmission Control Protocol together with the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) is currently considered as the most appropriate basis to meet the communication requirements of flight data exchanges between air traffic control units.
(6) This Regulation should cover the application of a flight message transfer protocol used for the information exchanges in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1032/2006 of 6 July 2006 laying down requirements for automatic systems for the exchange of flight data for the purpose of notification, coordination and transfer of flights between air traffic control units (4).
(7) This Regulation should not cover military operations and training as referred in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004.
(8) In a statement on military issues related to the Single European Sky (5), the Member States committed themselves to cooperate with each other, taking into account national military requirements, in order that the concept of flexible use of airspace is fully and uniformly applied in all Member States by all users of airspace.
(9) The application of the concept of flexible use of airspace, as defined in Article 2(22) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, requires the establishment of systems for the timely exchange of flight data between air traffic service units and controlling military units.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 20 January 1988
on the Belgian Government's aid proposal in favour of Roger Vanden Berghe NV, a polypropylene yarn and carpet producer located in Desselgem, Belgium
(Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)
(88/173/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments as provided for in the said Article 93, and having regard to those comments,
Whereas:
I
By letter dated 23 March 1987 and with reference to the synthetic fibres and yarn aid code, the Belgian Government notified the Commission of a proposal to grant financial assistance to Roger Vanden Berghe NV, a producer of polypropylene yarn and carpets located in Desseigem. Additional information was provided by telex of 13 May 1987.
The aid which would be granted under the Economic Reform Act of 4 August 1978 is intended to facilitate investments of Bfrs 47,98 million for the purpose of increasing polypropylene yarn production capacity and would take the form of a grant amounting to Bfrs 6 812 450.
Following an initial acrutiny, the Commission considered that the proposed aid would not meet the conditions which must be fulfilled in order to benefit from any of the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the EEC Treaty and, in particular, that it would not be in line with the synthetic fibres and yarn aid discipline introduced by the Commission in 1977, notified to the Member States by letter of 19 July 1977 and published in the Bulletin of the European Communities of July/August 1977 under point 1.5.3 and of November under point 2.1.47 and prolonged in 1979, 1981, 1983, 1985 and 1987.
Under this discipline aid has to be avoided if it has the effect of increasing production capacity in the sector concerned. In the present case the aid is intended for an extension of polypropylene yarn production capacity by 100 %.
The Commission also considered that this investment had been undertaken as early as 1985 without the use of State aid which was proposed retrospectively in 1987. Thus, the aid was and is not necessary for the development of the economic activities at issue and, consequently, would give an unfair advantage to the undertaking concerned, the financial position of which would merely be bolstered. The aid would allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest as set out in Article 92 (3).
Therefore, the Commission initiated the procedure provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty.
By letter of 26 June 1987, it gave the Belgian Government notice to submit its comments. The other Member States were informed on 4 August and third parties on 8 October 1987.
II
By letter dated 21 September 1987, the Belgian Government informed the Commission that it had no comments to make under the procedure thus initiated.
In commenting under this procedure, four other Member States and two federations of firms in the sector supported the Commission's view as stated at the opening of the procedure.
III
There is a high volume of trade in synethetic yarn and particularly in polypropylene yarn with approximately 60 % of total EC-production of this product being traded within the Community. The company in question, the production capacity of which has risen from 2,95 % to 5,9 % of total EC capacity by way of the investment at issue here, participates actively in this intra-Community trade by exporting 30 % of its production to other Member States.
The relevant market in this case is the market for polypropylene yarn for the purpose of carpet production, which takes approximately two-thirds of total polypropylene yarn production in the EC. Despite growing consumption, considerable over-capacity persists in this market as new capacities are being installed at a very fast rate. From 1985 to 1986, for example, production and consumption in the EC increased by 3,8 % while capacity rose by 9,0 %. The present capacity-utilization rate in the EC is 82 %, down from 86 % in 1985, which, particularly in view of considerable and growing pressure from third countries, is insufficient.
As a result there is heavy competition amongst the 47 polypropylene yarn producers in the EC. The firm at issue here ranked 18th in this group before the investment; now it is amongst the 10 most important polypropylene yarn producers in the EC.
The proposed assistance of Bfrs 6 812 450 to be granted under the Economic Reform Act of 4 August 1978 is State aid within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty (1). This amount, even if relatively small in absolute terms, contains an important advantage because the aid would reduce the investment costs by 8,1 % net grant equivalent and would allow the firm to increase its capacity by 100 % without having to support all the costs related to this increase as unaided competitors would have, if they wished, to undertake such investments. Therefore, the aid would strengthen the firm's position compared to its competitors in intra-Community trade and the latter would be affected by this aid. As there is considerable trade in polypropylene yarn in the EC, because competition is very keen and as the firm in question participates actively in intra-EC trade, the proposed assistance is liable to affect trade and distort or threaten to distort competition within the meaning of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty. Article 92 (1) lays down the principle that aid having the features there described is incompatible with the common market.
The exceptions from this principle set out in Article 92 (2) are not applicable in this case because of the character of the aid and as the act under which the aid is to be granted is not intended for such purposes.
Article 92 (3) sets out which aid may be considered to be compatible with the common market. The compatibility with the Treaty must be determined in the context of the Community and not of a single Member State. In order to safeguard the proper functioning of the common market and taking into account the principles of Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, the exceptions to the principle of Article 92 (1) of the Treaty as set out in Article 92 (3) must be construed narrowly when an aid scheme or any individual award is scrutinized.
In particular, they may be applied only when the Commission is satisfied that the free play of market forces alone, without the aid, would not induce the prospective aid recipient to adopt a course of action contributing to attainment of one of the said objectives.
To apply the exceptions to cases not contributing to such an objective or where an aid is not necessary to that end would be to give unfair advantages to certain Member States' industries or undertakings, the financial positions of which would merely be bolstered, and allow trading conditions between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without any justification on grounds of Community interest.
The Belgian Government has been unable to give, or the Commission to discover, any justification for a finding that the proposed aid falls within one of the categories of exceptions in Article 92 (3).
With regard to the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) relating to aid intended to promote or facilitate the development of certain areas, it must be observed that the standard of living in Belgium is not abnormally low nor is there serious underemployment within the meaning of the exemption specified in (a). Furthermore, the exemption set out in subparagraph (a) has not been put forward by the Belgian Government. Because the proposed aid applies to an individual firm in a given economic sector irrespective of where it is located, it is not intended for or suited to the development of certain areas as provided for in the exemption specified in (c).
As regards the exemptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (b), it is evident that the aid is not intended to promote the execution of an important project of common European interest or to remedy a serious disturbance in the Belgian economy. A specific aid in favour of only one polypropylene and carpet producer is not suited to remedying the kind of situation described in Article 92 (3) (b).
With regard to the exemption provided for in Article 92 (3) (c) in favour of 'aid to facilitate the development of certain economic activities', it must be observed that in synthetic fibres and yarns in general and particularly in polypropylene yarn there is a high level of trade between Member States and competition is very keen, because of persistent and uncontested over-capacity as documented above. For these reasons, synthetic fibres and yarns are subject to the synthetic fibre aid discipline, introduced by the Commission in 1977 and prolonged in 1979, 1981, 1983 and 1985.
In its letter of 7 July 1987, by which it extended the system of control of aid for a further two-year period ending on 19 July 1989, the Commission pointed out to Member States that it will express an unfavourable a priori opinion with regard to proposed aid, be it sectoral, regional or general, which has the effect of increasing the net production capacity of companies in this sector. It also reminded Member States that it will continue to give sympathetic consideration only to proposals to grant aid for the purpose of speeding up or facilitating the process of conversion away from synthetic fibres into other activities or restructuring leading to reductions in capacity.
Polypropylene carpet yarn belongs to the group of products which is subject to the synthetic fibres and yarn aid code and the investment at issue here, which took place in 1985, concerned the expansion of polypropylene yarn production capacity by 100 %.
Any artificial lowering of the expansion costs of a polypropylene yarn producer would in the situation described above weaken the competitive position of other producers and would have the effect of reducing capacity utilization and depressing prices, to the detriment and possible withdrawal from the market of producers, not only of polypropylene but also of substitutable yarns such as polyamide, which have hitherto survived owing to restructuring and productivity improvements undertaken from their own resources.
For the same or similar reasons, the Commission has had to prohibit State aid to other polypropylene yarn producers in the EC in the past (Decisions No 84/428/EEC of 27 June 1984 and No 85/471/EEC of 10 July 1985).
Therefore, the proposed aid does not meet the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for one of the exceptions of the synthetic fibres and yarn aid discipline to apply.
Furthermore, the aid is proposed retrospectively for an investment carried out in 1985 without the use of State aid. Thus, the aid was and is not necessary for the development of the firm at issue and would merely give unfair advantages to this undertaking.
It is therefore concluded that the aid proposed for the benefit of Roger Vanden Berghe NV as notified to the Commission, by retrospectively favouring, in a sector facing severe over-capacity problems, a capacity expansion undertaken by this firm, the market position of which would no longer be solely determined by its own efficiency, merits and powers, while contributing to the development of a given economic activity must be considered as adversely affecting trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest.
Consequently, the proposed aid does not meet the conditions which must be fulfilled in order for one of the exceptions of Article 92 (2) and (3) of the EEC Treaty to apply,","{'title': ""88/173/EEC: Commission Decision of 20 January 1988 on the Belgian Government's aid proposal in favour of Roger Vanden Berghe NV, a polypropylene yarn and carpet producer located in Desselgem, Belgium (Only the French and Dutch texts are authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92 (3) sets out which aid may be considered to be compatible with the common market.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 10/81 of 1 January 1981 fixing, in respect of fruit and vegetables, the general rules for implementing the 1979 Act of Accession (1), and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,
Whereas Article 75 of the Act of Accession introduces a compensatory mechanism on import into the Community of Nine, for fruit and vegetables coming from Greece for which an institutional price is fixed;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 75 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually, on the one hand, on the basis of the arithmetical average of producer prices of each Member State of the Community of Nine, increased by the transport and packaging costs borne by the products from the areas of production up to the representative centres of Community consumption and, on the other hand, taking into account the trend of production costs in the fruit and vegetables sector; whereas the said producer prices are to correspond to an average of the price quotations recorded over three years prior to fixing the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price may not exceed the level of the reference price applied vis-Ă -vis third countries, this Community offer price being reduced by 18 % at the time of the sixth move toward price alignment referred to in Article 59 of the Act;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal price variations, the marketing year should be split into several periods and a Community offer price fixed for each such period;
Whereas, by virtue of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 10/81, the rates used to calculate production prices are those recorded for an indigenous product whose trade characteristics are defined, on the representative market or markets within the production zones where the rates are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a substantial proportion of marketable production throughout the year or during a part of the year and which correspond to quality class I and to set conditions in respect of packaging; whereas the average rate for each representative market is to be drawn up disregarding rates which may be considered excessively high or low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the said market;
Whereas, up to 10 July, tomatoes produced in the Community of Nine are grown mainly under glass; whereas the Community offer price for this period of the marketing year must therefore be fixed for a product of that type; whereas Greek tomatoes during the same period will have been grown in the open; whereas, although such tomatoes may be classed in class I, their quality and price are not comparable with those of products grown under glass; whereas the prices for tomatoes not grown under glass should therefore be adjusted by a conversion factor;
Whereas application of the abovementioned criteria results in fixing the Community offer prices for tomatoes for the period 1 April to 20 December 1986 at the levels set out hereinafter;

Whereas the conditions for the abandonment of this practice are not yet ripe in that country as they are related to the structure of wine-growing and consumers' attitudes, which change relatively slowly; whereas the abandonment of the abovementioned practice would result in the immediate future in a serious imbalance on the market generating a shortage of red wine and a substantial surplus of white wine, which would require major intervention operations; whereas the need to avoid very serious disturbance of the market justifies the adoption of a transitional measure;
Whereas, so that the possibility of carrying out coupage involving white table wine and red table wine remains limited to the country where it is necessary, care must be taken to ensure that wine obtained from this practice may not be mixed with other Community wines;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of that Regulation. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(5) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(6) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(7) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial.
(8) To prevent any abuse through the re-import into the Community of sugar products in receipt of an export refund, no refund should be set for all the countries of the western Balkans for the products covered by this Regulation.
(9) In view of the above and of the present situation on the market in sugar, and in particular of the quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market, refunds should be set at the appropriate amounts.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 8 January 1998 concerning an application for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China (Only the English text is authentic) (98/72/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2331/96 (2) (hereafter referred to as the Basic Regulation), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90 (3) of 15 November 1990 imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of woven polyolefin sacks falling within CN code ex 6305 31 91 and originating in the People's Republic of China. The rate of the definitive duty was set at 43,4 %.
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2346/93 (4) of 23 August 1993 amended the above Regulation and raised the duty rate to 85,7 %.
(3) On 18 May 1995, Envopak Group Ltd imported one shipment of DHL courier bags made from woven polypropylene originating in China. The goods concerned were declared within tariff heading 6305 39 00. This classification was challenged by UK Customs and Excise which determined on 26 May 1995 that the goods' proper classification was within heading 6305 31 91 and that they were therefore subject to the anti-dumping duty of 85,7 %. The anti-dumping duties were finally paid on 25 July 1995.
(4) The final purchaser of the goods, the international courier company DHL submitted an appeal on 20 June 1995 to UK Customs and Excise for a Departmental Review under the UK law implementing Article 245 of the Community Customs Code against the imposition of the anti-dumping duty, claiming that the goods should be classified within customs heading 4202 as travel bags. The classification within customs heading 6305 31 91 was confirmed by this review on 28 June 1995.
(5) Envopak subsequently lodged a formal Notice of Appeal on 2 August 1995 to the VAT and Duties Tribunal set up pursuant to Article 245 of the Community Customs Code claiming that the goods concerned should be classified within heading 4202. The Tribunal heard the appeal on 7 December 1995 and confirmed on 16 January 1996 that the classification within tariff heading 6305 31 91 was correct.
(6) By Notice of Initiation No 95/C 271/03 (5) and following a complaint lodged by the European Association for Textile Polyolefins, the Commission initiated, on 17 October 1995, a review pursuant to Article 11(2) and (3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 3283/94 of the anti-dumping measures in force on imports of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China.
On 21 March 1996, Envopak Group Ltd made a submission to the Commission that the goods concerned did not fall within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90. The Commission confirmed that it considered that, in the framework of the review, the goods concerned fell within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90 and informed Envopak Group Ltd on 20 June 1996.
(7) On 16 July 1996 Envopak Group Ltd lodged an application pursuant to Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation for the refund of the definitive anti-dumping duties paid on the importation of a shipment of woven polyolefin sacks, originating in the People's Republic of China, on 18 May 1995.
(8) On 30 June 1997, the Commission disclosed to the applicant the main facts and considerations on the basis of which it intended to declare the application inadmissible. The applicant was given the opportunity to submit comments prior to the final decision. The applicant commented that it found that the Commission had inappropriately dealt with the issue of the like product in the framework of the refund procedure.
B. ARGUMENTS OF THE APPLICANT
(9) The applicant claims in its applications pursuant to Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation that the dumping margins in respect of the polyolefin woven sacks imported on 18 May 1995 has been eliminated in comparison with the level of 85,7 % of anti-dumping duty set by Regulation (EEC) No 3308/90.
(10) In addition, the applicant argued that the product under consideration should not be classified within customs heading 6305 31 91 and, should therefore not be subject to the anti-dumping duties.
(11) The applicant further argued that the product under consideration, even if classified within customs heading 6305 31 91 does not constitute a like product and, should therefore not be subject to the anti-dumping duties.
(12) Finally, the applicant acknowledged in its application for a refund that it was submitted out of time. However, it claimed that the Commission should take into account the exceptional circumstances of the case, in particular the length of the appeal procedures before the national Customs authorities described at recitals (4) and (5) above and of making the submission to the Commission on the issue of the like product, to grant an extension of the time limit for the submission of the application and consider it admissible.
C. ADMISSIBILITY
1. Like product and classification
(13) The refund procedure is not intended to address the issues of like product or customs classification. Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation stipulates that an importer may request reimbursement where it is shown that the dumping margin on the basis of which the duties were paid has been eliminated or reduced below the level of duty in force. This implies that the imports of the goods in question had been rightly determined to be covered by the measures in force. Therefore, the issues of like product and customs classification are irrelevant in the context of a refund procedure and have been dealt with in their appropriate frameworks as described in recitals (3) to (6).
2. Time limit
(14) Article 11(8) of the Basic Regulation states that in requesting a refund the importer shall submit an application within six months of the date on which the amount of the definitive duties to be levied was duly determined by the competent authorities. This submission of an application in due time is an absolute requirement for the admissibility of a refund application, which is not subject to exceptions regardless of the circumstances.
Therefore, neither the appeal procedures before the national Customs authorities nor the submission before the Commission on the issue of like product could have had the effect of interrupting the six month time limit of Article 11(8).
(15) The amount of definitive duties to be levied is therefore considered to have been determined no later than 26 May 1995. The six month time limit therefore expired no later than 26 November 1995.
The application which was submitted on 25 July 1996 should therefore be considered as out of time and rejected as inadmissible,","{'title': ""98/72/EC: Commission Decision of 8 January 1998 concerning an application for the refund of anti-dumping duties collected$on imports of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China (Only the English text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nThe application for the refund of anti-dumping duties submitted by Envopak Group Sales for the importation made on 18 May 1995 of woven polyolefin sacks originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby rejected.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and to Envopak Group Limited.\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 January 1998.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nLeon BRITTAN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ L 56, 6. 3. 1996, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 317, 6. 12. 1996, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 318, 17. 11. 1990, p. 1.\n\n(4) OJ L 215, 25. 8. 1993, p. 3.\n\n(5) OJ C 271, 17. 10. 1995, p. 3.'}]}"

The specific aid is paid on the basis of deliveries which may be made up to 30 April of the year following that of harvest and, therefore, certain producer organisations have difficulties using the specific aid in full within the following two months and meeting the 30 June deadline.

providing for compensation to producer organisations for tuna delivered to the processing industry between 1 January and 31 March 2007
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 of 17 December 1999 on the common organisation of the market in fishery and aquaculture products (1), and in particular Article 27(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The compensatory allowance provided for in Article 27 of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 may be granted under certain conditions to Community tuna producer organisations for quantities of tuna delivered to the processing industry during the calendar quarter for which prices were recorded, where both the average quarterly selling price recorded on the Community market and the import price plus any countervailing charge were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price for the product concerned.
(2) An examination of the situation on the Community market has shown that between 1 January and 31 March 2007 both the average quarterly selling price and the import price as referred to in Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) were lower than 87 % of the Community producer price in force, as laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 1969/2006 (2).
(3) Entitlement to the compensatory allowance should be determined on the basis of sales which are covered by invoices bearing a date falling within the quarter concerned and which have been used to calculate the average monthly selling price in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2183/2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 as regards granting the compensatory allowance for tuna intended for the processing industry (3).
(4) In accordance with Article 27(2) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 the level of the compensation may not in any case exceed either the difference between the triggering threshold and the average selling price of the product in question on the Community market or a flat-rate amount equivalent to 12 % of that threshold.
(5) The quantities on which compensation is payable may under no circumstances, for the quarter concerned, exceed the limits laid down in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000.
(6) The quantities of Albacore (Thunnus alalunga) sold and delivered to the processing industry established in the customs territory of the Community were higher during the quarter concerned than the quantities sold and delivered during the same quarter of the three previous fishing years. Since those quantities exceed the limit set in Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, the total quantities of those products on which compensation is payable should be limited.
(7) In accordance with the ceilings laid down in Article 27(4) of Regulation (EC) No 104/2000 for the purpose of calculating the allowance to be granted to each producer organisation, the quantities on which the allowance is payable should be allocated among the producer organisations concerned in proportion to the quantities produced by them in the same quarter of the 2004, 2005 and 2006 fishing years.

Whereas, in addition, providing aid for road facilities specific to combined transport would be an effective way of encouraging small and medium-sized undertakings to avail themselves of combined transport services;
Whereas aid for equipment specific to combined transport would foster the development of new bimodal and transhipment technology;
Whereas during a limited start-up phase the possibility of granting aid should therefore be extended to investment in transport facilities specifically designed for combined transport, provided that they are used exclusively for that purpose;

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 80/665/EEC of 24 June 1980 on the control of potato ring rot (1), and in particular Article 9 (2) thereof,
Whereas, where a Member State considers that there is an imminent danger of the introduction into its territory of potato ring rot from another Member State, it may temporarily take any additional measures necessary to protect itself from that danger;
Whereas a Member State may also take such measures where another Member State informs it of confirmed contamination by potato ring rot;
Whereas Ireland and the United Kingdom notified the other Member States and the Commission, at the time of adoption of Directive 80/665/EEC, that they were maintaining measures banning the introduction into their territories of potatoes originating in Denmark, because of potato ring rot known to occur there;
Whereas France notified the other Member States and the Commission in 1983 that it was laying down certain additional requirements applicable to potatoes originating in Denmark, with a view to strengthening protection against the introduction of potato ring rot from Denmark;
Whereas the Netherlands notified the other Member States and the Commission in 1987 of the adoption of measures banning the introduction into its territory of potatoes originating in Denmark, again because of the risk of introducing potato ring rot from that Member State;
Whereas it is well known that potato ring rot has occurred in Denmark for more than 25 years;
Whereas Denmark has implemented an eradication programme the early results of which have suggested it to be effective;
Whereas, in particular, since 1984 the entire potato stock material has been renewed by cleaned and healthy material; whereas since 1986 both seed potatoes and ware potatoes may be produced in Denmark only where they derive from such cleaned and healthy stock material;
Whereas, moreover, Denmark has set up appropriate production, processing and distribution structures, aimed at preventing reinfections of potatoes produced under the above conditions;
Whereas the results of intensive official surveys, including testing carried out in accordance with the established Community method for the detection and diagnosis of Corynebacterium sepedonicum, carried out in Denmark on potatoes harvested there in 1986, have so far confirmed that potatoes produced in Denmark at least since 1986 may be deemed to be free from potato ring rot;
Whereas, nevertheless, precautionary measures should be taken on a temporary basis to consolidate this conclusion, before the situation in Denmark is treated as entirely the same as that in the other Member States, in which potato ring rot is not known to occur; these precautionary measures should complete the control patterns which Denmark has set up under Directive 80/665/EEC in respect of its entire potato production, and they would be without prejudice to the phytosanitary inspections which may be carried out by the introducing Member States under the Community plant health regime;
Whereas the additional measures adopted by France, Ireland, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom should therefore be made more flexible from the beginning of the 1987/88 production year onwards;
