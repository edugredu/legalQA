amending Council Directive 90/642/EEC as regards the maximum levels for certain pesticide residues fixed therein
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin including fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (2), and in particular Article 4(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Directive 91/414/EEC, authorisations of plant protection products for use on specific crops are the responsibility of the Member States. Such authorisations are required to be based on the evaluation of effects on human and animal health and influence on the environment. Elements to be taken into account in such evaluations include operator and bystander exposure and impact on the terrestrial, aquatic and aerial environments, as well as impact on humans and animals through consumption of residues on treated crops.
(2) Maximum residue levels (MRLs) reflect the use of minimum quantities of pesticides to achieve effective protection of plants, applied in such a manner that the amount of residue is the smallest practicable and is toxicologically acceptable, in particular in terms of estimated dietary intake.
(3) MRLs are fixed at the lower limit of analytical determination where authorised uses of plant protection products do not result in detectable levels of pesticide residue in or on the food product, or where there are no authorised uses, or where uses which have been authorised by Member States have not been supported by the necessary data, or where uses in third countries resulting in residues in or on food products which may enter into circulation in the Community market have not been supported with such necessary data.
(4) MRLs for pesticides should be kept under review. They may be changed to take account of new uses, new information and data.
(5) Information on new or changed uses of certain pesticides covered by Directive 90/642/EEC have been notified to the Commission.
(6) The lifetime exposure of consumers to these pesticides via food products that may contain residues of these pesticides, has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices used within the Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (3). It has been calculated that the MRLs concerned will ensure that the acceptable daily intakes are not exceeded.
(7) Where appropriate, the acute exposure of consumers to these pesticides via each of the food products that may contain residues of these pesticides has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with the procedures and practices currently used within the European Community, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Plants, in particular advice and recommendations concerning the protection of consumers of food products treated with pesticides, have been taken into account.
(8) Therefore it is appropriate to fix new maximum levels for residues of those pesticides.
(9) Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The setting or modification at Community level of provisional MRLs does not prevent the Member States from establishing provisional MRLs for the substances concerned in accordance with Article 4(1)(f) of Directive 91/414/EEC and Annex VI thereto. It is considered that a period of four years is sufficient to permit further uses of the active substance concerned. The provisional MRL should then become definitive.

fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 15 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kg for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) However in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 4(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account should be taken, where necessary, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 or to assimilated products.
(6) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2571/97 of 15 December 1997 on the sale of butter at reduced prices and the granting of aid for cream, butter and concentrated butter for use in the manufacture of pastry products, ice-cream and other foodstuffs (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (3),
(1) Whereas solid fuels are available in the Community and the ready, abundant, diverse sources of hard coal traded worldwide ensure that such fuels are and will remain a low-cost energy source;
(2) Whereas the promotion of clean and efficient technologies for solid fuels contributes to the diversification of primary energy resources and to the balance of Community energy policy objectives;
(3) Whereas solid fuels will be increasingly utilised both in developed and emerging areas of the world, thereby contributing to emissions of pollutants and 2; whereas every effort should be made to ameliorate such emissions by the promotion of clean and efficient technologies and the application of best available technologies (BAT) to existing and new plant using solid fuels;
(4) Whereas the manufacture and supply of equipment for the clean utilisation of coal, lignite and other forms of solid fuels, for use both within and outside the Community, can contribute to the maintenance of employment;
(5) Whereas action by the Community relating to the environment should improve the quality of the environment and ensure a prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, objectives which are furthered by the implementation of clean coal technologies;
(6) Whereas the promotion of more efficient clean solid fuel technologies can make a significant contribution to the reduction of polluting emissions arising from the use of fossil fuels at Community level; whereas use of cleaner technologies contributes to the objectives of the Community strategy to combat acidification;
(7) Whereas the promotion of more efficient clean solid fuel technologies will contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gases and the danger of global climate change; whereas wide-ranging cooperation is therefore desirable in order to obtain significant results;
(8) Whereas it is desirable that promotion of clean solid fuel technologies should be applied both to domestic and small-scale commercial and industrial boilers as well as large electrical power generation plants;
(9) Whereas on 13 December 1995 the Commission adopted a White Paper entitled 'An energy policy for the European Union`, defining the main lines of new Community energy policy objectives for coherence and convergence of the policies of the Member States; whereas this White Paper states that the contribution of new clean solid fuel technologies can enhance the use of a wide variety of fuels, so that they can continue to play a significant part in the overall energy balance sheet but with an improved environmental image;
(10) Whereas the promotion and exploitation of clean solid fuel technologies offers economic advantages in terms of employment opportunities with companies in the Community operating on a worldwide basis;
(11) Whereas, in order to sustain a cleaner environment, advanced clean solid fuel technologies should be developed to achieve improved BAT at costs which can be afforded;
(12) Whereas certain countries which are expected to become members of the European Union in the coming years are very strongly dependent on the production and use of solid fuels to meet their energy requirements; whereas those countries will need to modernise and improve their energy technologies in order to comply with Community legislation;
(13) Whereas a number of Member States have their own clean solid fuel technology programmes;
(14) Whereas there should be an opportunity for those programmes to be coordinated with each other and with the relevant Community programmes;
(15) Whereas it is also important to promote the uptake of technologies developed with financing from the specific research and technical development non-nuclear energy programme;
(16) Whereas provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998 to 2002) adopted by Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom (4) for a specific programme for the promotion of clean solid fuel technologies;
(17) Whereas, in order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work avoided, the Commission will ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; whereas it will systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects;
(18) Whereas actions on solid fuels may cover projects dealing with hard coal, lignite, peat, ormulsion, oilshale and the heavy fraction of petroleum products; whereas, in implementing such projects, account can also be taken of the application of clean combustion technologies to biomass and clean sorted combustible waste fractions when mixed with solid fuels;
(19) Whereas the European Parliament and Community industry have indicated their keen interest in pursuing a policy of developing clean coal technologies for use in the Community and elsewhere in the world;
(20) Whereas it is politically and economically desirable to open the programme to the associated Central and East European countries, in accordance with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of 21 to 22 June 1993 and as outlined in the Commission communication on that subject in May 1994; whereas it should also be open to Cyprus;
(21) Whereas the Amsterdam European Council of 16 and 17 June 1997 highlighted the importance of solid fuel research and development by its request that the research in that field currently supported under the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community should be continued in an appropriate form after the expiry of that Treaty in 2002;
(22) Whereas there is a need to transfer to industry the results of the research funded under the European Coal and Steel Community;
(23) Whereas the measures to foster industrial strategic cooperation should be designed to encourage industry to exchange experiences on, for example, how environmental standards are met;
(24) Whereas the promotion, demonstration and exploitation of clean solid fuel technologies throughout the Community are likely to strengthen its economic and social cohesion, as called for by Article 130a of the Treaty;
(25) Whereas a financial reference amount within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 (5), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of this programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty; whereas account should be taken of the fact that a new financial perspective will be negotiated during the course of this programme;

Whereas under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 3164/76 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1841/88 (4), the Council is required to take a decision on the increase, from 1990, in the Community quota for the carriage of goods by road between Member States and on the measures to be taken in the event of a crisis;
Whereas Article 4a of Regulation (EEC) No 3164/76 provides for abolition of all quotas, including the Community quota, from 1 January 1993;
Whereas at its meeting on 30 June 1986, the Council adopted conclusions requiring the Community quota to be increased by 40 % each year starting in 1987 and continuing until the implementation in 1993 of an intra-Community road haulage market free of all quantitative restrictions;
Whereas pursuant to those conclusions the Community quota was indeed increased by 40 % in 1987, 1988 and 1989;
Whereas to ensure that the changeover to the new system applicable from 1993 is as smooth as possible and does not disturb the market, and to achieve freedom to provide road haulage services between Member States, the Community quota should be increased by 40 % in 1990;
Whereas increases in the Community quota for 1991 and 1992 should be adopted parallel with provisions on the measures to be taken in the event of a crisis;
Whereas, as in 1989, the number of authorizations resulting from the increase in the Community quota should be allocated to the Member States on a linear basis, without prejudice to the method to be applied in subsequent years;

(2) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, provides that entitlement to the export refund is acquired on importation into a specific third country when a differentiated refund applies for that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the differentiated refund, in particular the documents to be supplied as proof of the goods’ arrival at destination.
(3) In the case of a differentiated refund, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 provides that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 of 24 September 2004 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Bulgaria and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Bulgaria (4), provides on an autonomous basis for the abolition of refunds on processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty when exported to Bulgaria, from 1 October 2004.
(5) Bulgaria has undertaken to grant the preferential import arrangements to goods imported into its territory only if the goods concerned are accompanied by documents stating that they are not eligible for payment of export refunds.
(6) In the light of those arrangements, as a transitory measure in view of the possible accession to the European Union of Bulgaria and in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary costs on operators in their commercial trade with other third countries, it is appropriate to derogate from Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 in so far as it requires proof of import in the case of differentiated refunds. It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.
(7) Since the autonomous and transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 will apply as from 1 October 2004 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.

It is also appropriate, where no export refunds have been fixed for the particular countries of destination in question, not to take account of that fact when the lowest rate of refund is determined.\n\n((7)) Since the autonomous and transitional measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004 will apply as from 1 October 2004 this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nBy way of derogation from Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999, where the differentiation of the refund is the result solely of a refund not having been fixed for Bulgaria proof that the customs import formalities have been completed shall not be a condition for payment of the refund in respect of all goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThe fact that no export refund has been fixed in respect of the export to Bulgaria of the goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, which are covered by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2004, shall not be taken into account in determining the lowest rate of refund within the meaning of Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 1 October 2004.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accruing from value added tax (1), and in particular Article 4(4) and the second indent of Article 6(3) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee on Own Resources,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 377 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC (2), Portugal may continue to exempt the transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X, Part B to that Directive, in accordance with the conditions applying in that Member State on 1 January 1989; those transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT own resources base.
(2) In its response of 10 April 2014 to the letter of 19 February 2014 of the Commission regarding the simplification of VAT own resources inspections (3), Portugal requested authorisation from the Commission to use a fixed percentage of the intermediate base for the calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC for the financial years 2014 to 2020. Portugal has shown that the historical percentage has remained stable over time. Portugal should therefore be authorised to calculate the VAT own resources base using a fixed percentage in accordance with the letter sent by the Commission.
(3) Portugal has requested authorisation from the Commission to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from 2011 to calculate the weighted average rate of VAT for the financial year 2014. The latest available ESA 95 National Accounts data with the necessary level of disaggregation is from year 2010, whereas ESA 2010 National Accounts data with the necessary disaggregation will be available from year 2011 by the time Portugal has to submit its statement of the VAT own resources base for the financial year 2014. Portugal should therefore be authorised to use ESA 2010 National Accounts data from year 2011 for the purpose of calculating the weighted average rate of VAT for financial year 2014.
(4) Under Article 10(2) of Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (ESA 2010), Member States may, for the purpose of determination of the VAT-based own resource, use data based on the ESA 2010 while Council Decision 2007/436/EC, Euratom (5) remains in force, where the required detailed ESA 95 data are not available.
(5) For reasons of transparency and legal certainty it is appropriate to limit the applicability of the authorisation in time.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to amend Commission Implementing Decision 2013/749/EU, Euratom (6) accordingly,","{'header': '28.11.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 343/27', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 26 November 2014\namending Implementing Decision 2013/749/EU, Euratom authorising Portugal to use certain approximate estimates for the calculation of the VAT own resources base\n(notified under document C(2014) 8922)\n(Only the Portuguese text is authentic)\n(2014/841/EU, Euratom)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 377 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC(2), Portugal may continue to exempt the transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X, Part B to that Directive, in accordance with the conditions applying in that Member State on 1 January 1989; those transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT own resources base.\n\n((2)) In its response of 10 April 2014 to the letter of 19 February 2014 of the Commission regarding the simplification of VAT own resources inspections(3), Portugal requested authorisation from the Commission to use a fixed percentage of the intermediate base for the calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC for the financial years 2014 to 2020.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/1996 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 of 13 August 2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate film originating in India and the Republic of Korea (2), and in particular Article 1(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001, imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of polyethylene terephthalate film (PET film) originating, inter alia, in India. Given the large number of exporting producers of PET film in India, during the investigation which led to the adoption of that Regulation (the original investigation) a sample of exporting producers was selected in accordance with Article 17 of the basic Regulation. Individual dumping margins ranging from 0 % to 65,3 % were calculated for companies individually investigated and a dumping margin of 57,7 % was also calculated, in accordance with Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation, for cooperating companies not part of the sample. Anti-dumping duties were subsequently imposed ranging from 0 % to 62,6 %, taking also into account the countervailing duties resulting from export subsidies imposed on the same products originating from India, which were then applicable by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 (3).
(2) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 366/2006 (4) (the amending Regulation), amended the level of dumping margins calculated by Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001. The new dumping margins range between 3,2 % and 29,3 % and the new anti-dumping duty range between 0 % and 18 %, again in order to take account of the countervailing duties resulting from export subsidies imposed on the same products originating from India, as modified according to Council Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (5), which has been adopted following an expiry review of Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999.
(3) Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 sets the countervailing duty applicable to companies other than those individually listed in its Article 1(2) at 19,1 %, the export subsidy margin for those companies being calculated at the level of 12 %.
(4) Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 366/2006, establishes three criteria, as detailed in recital (7) below, which, when met, give the possibility to Indian exporting producers which were not subject to anti-dumping measures following the original investigation to be granted new exporting producer treatment. Applicants which are granted this treatment are attributed the same duty rate as the companies which had cooperated in the original investigation but were not included in the sample. They are therefore subject to a duty which corresponds to the weighted average margin of dumping established for the companies included in the sample during the original investigation, being understood that any zero and de minimis margin are disregarded, pursuant to Article 9(6) of the basic Regulation.
(5) During the original investigation, the above mentioned weighted average dumping margin was calculated as the weighted average of the dumping margins of three sampled companies, since one of the four originally sampled companies had a zero margin. The weighted average margin of dumping so calculated in the original investigation was, as mentioned in recital (1), 57,7 %. The amending Regulation reduces significantly the margin of dumping of the three above mentioned companies. The new weighted average margin of dumping, to be applied to companies fulfilling the requirements of Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001, recalculated following the findings of the amending Regulation is therefore 15,5 %.
B.   NEW EXPORTING PRODUCER REQUESTS
(6) The Indian exporting producer SRF Limited (the applicant) has applied to be granted the same treatment as the companies cooperating in the original investigation not included in the sample (new exporting producer treatment).
(7) An examination has been carried out in order to determine whether the applicant fulfils the criteria for being granted new exporting producer treatment as set out in Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001, namely it was examined:
— that it did not export to the Community the goods described in Article 1(1) of that Regulation during the original investigation period (1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000),
— that it is not related to any exporter or producer in India subject to the measures imposed by the Regulation,
— that it has exported the goods concerned after the investigation period, or it has entered into an irrevocable contractual obligation to export a significant quantity to the Community.
(8) A questionnaire was sent to the applicant which was also asked to provide evidence to demonstrate that it meets the three criteria mentioned above.
(9) The applicant replied to the questionnaire and provided evidence that is considered sufficient to consider it as a new exporting producer.
(10) The anti-dumping duty rate applicable to the applicant should be based on the weighted average margin of dumping established for the parties selected in the sample in the original investigation, as modified following the amending Regulation, i.e. 15,5 %, as indicated in recital (5) above.
(11) Since, pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from the provision of export subsidies, this duty rate is to be reduced by the applicant’s export subsidy margin as ascertained in the anti-subsidy investigation which led to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (see recital (59) of Regulation (EC) No 366/2006). Since the applicant does not have an individual countervailing duty, the duty rate established for all other companies should apply.
(12) The anti-dumping duty rate applicable to the applicant should therefore be calculated as indicated in the table below.
Company Export subsidy margin Total subsidy margin Dumping margin CVD duty AD duty Total duty rate
SRF Limited 12,0 % 19,1 % 15,5 % 19,1 % 3,5 % 22,6 %
(13) The applicant and the Community industry have been informed of the findings of the examination and have had the opportunity to submit their comments.
(14) The applicant submitted comments on the calculation of the margin of dumping. These comments have been taken into account and are reflected in the above.
(15) All other arguments and submissions made by the parties were analysed and duly taken into account where warranted.","{'header': '29.9.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 270/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1424/2006\nof 25 September 2006\namending Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty and collecting definitively the provisional duty imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate film originating in India and the Republic of Korea', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nArticle 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1676/2001 shall be replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The rate of the definitive anti-dumping duty applicable to the net, free-at-Community-frontier price, before duty, shall be as follows for products originating in:\nCountry\nCompany\nDefinitive duty (%)\nTARIC Additional Code\nIndia\nEster Industries Limited\n75-76, Amrit Nagar\nBehind South Extension Part-1\nNew Delhi 110 003\nIndia\n17,3\nA026\nIndia\nFlex Industries Limited\nA-1, Sector 60\nNoida 201 301, (U.P.)\nIndia\n0\nA027\nIndia\nGarware Polyester Limited\nGarware House\n50-A, Swami Nityanand Marg\nVile Parle (East)\nMumbai 400 057\nIndia\n6,8\nA028\nIndia\nJindal Poly Films Limited\n56 Hanuman Road\nNew Delhi 110 001\nIndia\n0\nA030\nIndia\nMTZ Polyfilms Limited\nNew India Centre, 5th floor\n17 Co-operage Road\nMumbai 400 039\nIndia\n18,0\nA031\nIndia\nPolyplex Corporation Limited\nB-37, Sector-1\nNoida 201 301\nDist.

(2) In accordance with Article 64(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003, France decided to partially implement the Single Payment Scheme under the conditions laid down in particular in Article 68(2)(a)(i) of that Regulation as regards the additional payment for maintaining suckler cows. However, under Article 8(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 (3), which lays down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the French regions of Corsica and Hainault cannot, as from 2007, benefit from the transitional aid provided for in that Article. Consequently, the national premium supplementing the suckler cow premium provided for in Article 125(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 and granted to holdings situated in the French regions of Corsica and Hainault cannot be financed by the EAGF as from 1 January 2007. In order to ensure continued Community support for suckler cows, France has requested that an amount corresponding to the payments made under the additional national premium in Corsica and Hainault up to 2006 be transferred from the ceiling set for 2007 in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 552/2007 for the additional national premium to the ceiling set in that Annex for the suckler cow premium. The abovementioned budgetary ceilings should therefore be adjusted.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 88(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article 88 of the EC Treaty(1),
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the provisions cited above(2),
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) By letter No 13305 of 30 October 2001, the Italian authorities notified, pursuant to Article 88(3) of the Treaty, a draft scheme of aid for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Region of Sardinia.
(2) The scheme was to enter into force only after prior authorisation under Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty, and it was accordingly entered in the register of notified aid measures under number N 759/2001.
(3) The Commission requested additional information by letter dated 30 November 2001. After a reminder was sent to them on 24 January 2002, the Italian authorities replied by letter No 2236 of 20 February 2002.
(4) By letter dated 26 April 2002, the Commission informed Italy that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 88(2) of the EC Treaty in respect of the aid.
(5) The Commission decision to initiate the procedure was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3). The Commission invited interested parties to submit their comments on the aid.
(6) The Commission received no comments from interested parties.
II. DESCRIPTION
Object
(7) Because there is no natural gas distribution network in Sardinia, firms on the island have to pay more for energy than firms in other parts of Italy where there is such a network.
(8) In order to compensate SMEs in Sardinia for the extra cost of using more expensive energy sources, the scheme would provide for the grant of aid in the form of tax credits.
(9) The scheme is designed to meet regional development objectives.
Legal basis
(10) The legal basis is Article 145(9) of Law No 388/2000 of 23 December 2000 and the draft interministerial decree of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Production Activities concerning the conditions and procedures for granting tax aid to SMEs in the Region of Sardinia to compensate them for non-implementation of the natural gas distribution programme.
Duration and budget
(11) The scheme, which has a budget of EUR 10,3 million, covers the energy costs borne by firms in 2000 and 2001.
Recipients
(12) The recipients are SMEs within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 96/280/EC of 3 April 1996 concerning the definition of small and medium-sized enterprises(4) located in Sardinia and belonging to the agri-foodstuffs, textiles, clothing, paper, chemicals, petrochemicals, building materials, glass, ceramics and mechanical engineering sectors.
Objective of the scheme
(13) The scheme would provide operating aid, in that the aid is intended to reduce firms' routine energy costs.
Form and intensity of the aid
(14) The aid is to be granted in the form of tax credits amounting to no more than 60 % of the cost of buying liquid fuels (combustible oils and LPG).
III. DOUBTS RAISED BY THE COMMISSION IN THE ARTICLE 88(2) PROCEEDINGS
(15) As part of the procedure under Article 88(2) of the Treaty, the Commission expressed doubts as to whether the handicap identified by the Italian authorities was a structural handicap within the meaning of the guidelines on national regional aid, and whether the aid available under the scheme was justified in terms of its contribution to regional development.
(16) The Commission received no observations either from the Italian authorities or from other interested parties.
IV. ASSESSMENT
1. Do the measures constitute State aid?
(17) In order to assess whether the measures provided for in the scheme constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 87(1) of the Treaty, it has to be determined whether they confer an advantage on the recipients, whether that advantage derives from State resources, whether they affect competition, and whether they are liable to affect trade between Member States.
(18) The first requirement for the applicability of Article 87(1) of the Treaty is that the measure must confer an advantage on certain specific undertakings. It has to be determined whether the recipients receive an economic advantage they would not have received under normal market conditions, or whether they avoid costs which they would normally have had to bear out of their own financial resources, and whether this advantage is conferred on a specific category of undertaking. The granting of tax credits to firms located in one region of Italy, Sardinia, does confer an economic advantage on the recipients, because tax credits reduce the amount of tax that firms would otherwise have to bear. The measures favour firms operating in specific areas of Italy, because they are not available to firms outside those areas.
(19) The second requirement for the applicability of Article 87 is that the planned measures must be paid for by the State or out of State resources. In terms of State resources the measures involved here generate a negative quantity, a sum not collected by the public authorities, because the granting of tax credits reduces tax revenue.
(20) The third and fourth conditions for the applicability of Article 87(1) of the Treaty require that the aid distort or threaten to distort competition, and that it be liable to affect trade between Member States. The measures at issue here do threaten to distort competition, because they strengthen the financial position and freedom of action of the recipient firms as compared with competitors who do not qualify. If that effect makes itself felt in intra-Community trade, then trade between Member States is affected. The Court of Justice has held, for example in Case 102/87 France v Commission(5), that such measures distort competition and affect trade between Member States if the recipient firms export part of their output to other Member States, and that if they do not themselves export, domestic output is nevertheless favoured, because firms in other Member State have less opportunity to export their products to the firms' home market.
(21) The measures at issue are therefore in principle banned by Article 87(1), and can be considered to be compatible with the common market only if they qualify for one of the exemptions laid down in the Treaty.
2. Lawfulness of the scheme
(22) The measures have not yet entered into force, and the Commission accordingly finds that the Italian authorities have complied with the obligation to notify laid down in Article 88(3) of the Treaty.
3. Compatibility of the measures with the common market
(23) After determining that the measures under examination constitute State aid caught by Article 87(1) of the Treaty, the Commission has to consider whether they can be declared compatible with the common market under Article 87(2) and (3).
(24) The Commission takes the view that the aid does not qualify for the exemptions in Article 87(2): it is not aid having a social character of the kind referred to in Article 87(2)(a), nor is it aid intended to make good the damage caused by natural disasters or exceptional occurrences of the kind referred to in Article 87(2)(b), nor does it satisfy the tests of Article 87(2)(c). For obvious reasons the exemptions in Article 87(3)(b) and (d) are not applicable either.
(25) As the aid is operating aid, the Commission has to consider whether it qualifies for exemption under Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty.
Eligibility of the region
(26) On 1 March 2000 the Commission approved the Italian regional aid map for the period 2000 to 2006, delimiting the regions qualifying for exemption under Article 87(3)(a) of the Treaty(6). In accordance with that map Sardinia is a region eligible for aid under the exemption.
Operating aid
(27) Point 4.15 of the guidelines on national regional aid(7) states that regional aid aimed at reducing a firm's current expenses is normally prohibited. Exceptionally, however, such aid may be granted in regions eligible under the derogation in Article 87(3)(a), provided that it is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development and its nature, and provided its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate.
(28) Point 4.17 of the guidelines states that operating aid of this kind must be both limited in time and progressively reduced.
(29) Although the region where the aid at issue is to be granted is an area eligible for exemption under Article 87(3)(a), the Commission is unable to conclude on the basis of the information supplied by the Italian authorities that the aid is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development and its nature, and that its level is proportional to the handicaps it seeks to alleviate.
(30) Firstly, the aid provided for in the scheme, which replaces a scheme that applied in 1998 and 1999 under the de minimis rule, is intended to offset operating costs already borne by firms in 2000 and 2001. The fact that the period has already ended means that the aid cannot be necessary to compensate for structural handicaps, and that it cannot have an incentive effect. Moreover, given the period to which the scheme relates, the transitional nature of the measure has not been demonstrated.
(31) Secondly, the Commission is unable to conclude that the criteria applied for selecting recipient industries, the form taken by the aid or the aid's duration are suited to alleviating the type of handicap identified, or that the level of aid is proportional to that handicap, as the aid does not seem to be limited to the additional costs actually borne by the firms. Nor can the Commission conclude that the aid available under the scheme is to be progressively reduced.
(32) As regards the necessity of the measures in question as a means of contributing to the socioeconomic development of Sardinia, the Italian authorities have not provided information on the lack of economically viable energy sources that might be alternatives to natural gas, and the Commission consequently cannot conclude that the handicap identified by the Italian authorities, namely the lack of a natural gas distribution network, constitutes a genuine structural factor hampering the region's socioeconomic development.
(33) The Italian authorities argue that the lack of such a network obliges firms to have recourse to more expensive energy sources; it may indeed constitute a factor contributing to economic disequilibrium, in so far as the demand for a good, natural gas, is not satisfied by the supply of that good. But it will be possible to satisfy the demand once the infrastructure needed for natural gas distribution has been built and made available to businesses, which, under the plan for the creation of a methane gas distribution network on the island (Programma di metanizzazione della Sardegna), is provisionally scheduled to take place by the end of 2006.
(34) The Commission therefore cannot conclude that the handicap identified by the Italian authorities is a structural handicap within the scope of the guidelines on national regional aid, and that the aid available under the scheme is justified in terms of its contribution to regional development.
Production, processing and marketing of products listed in Annex 1 to the Treaty
Agriculture
(35) Under point 3.7 of the Community guidelines for State aid in the agriculture sector(8), the guidelines on national regional aid do not apply to the agricultural sector.
(36) Under point 3.5 of the same guidelines, unilateral State aid measures which are simply intended to improve the financial situation of producers but which in no way contribute to the development of the sector are considered to constitute operating aid which is incompatible with the common market.
(37) The aid provided for under the scheme at issue is of this kind, and is consequently incompatible with the common market.
Fisheries and aquaculture
(38) Under point 1.5 of the guidelines for the examination of State aid to fisheries and aquaculture(9), the guidelines on national regional aid do not apply to the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
(39) Under the third indent of the fourth paragraph of point 1.2 of the same guidelines, State aid which is granted without imposing any obligation on the recipients and which is intended to improve the situation of undertakings and increase their business liquidity constitutes operating aid which is incompatible with the common market.
(40) The aid proposed under the scheme at issue is of this kind, and is consequently incompatible with the common market.
V. CONCLUSIONS
(41) On the basis of the assessment set out in section IV.3, the Commission must find that the aid scheme to reduce the energy costs of SMEs in the Region of Sardinia is incompatible with the common market,","{'title': '2003/228/EC: Commission Decision of 16 October 2002 on the aid scheme by which Italy plans to reduce the energy costs of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Region of Sardinia (notified under document number C(2002) 3715) (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe aid scheme provided for in Law No 388/2000 by which Italy plans to reduce the energy costs of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Region of Sardinia is incompatible with the common market.\n\nThe scheme may accordingly not be implemented.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nItaly shall inform the Commission, within two months of notification of this Decision, of the measures taken to comply with it.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 October 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario Monti\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 83, 27.3.1999, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ C 132, 4.6.2002, p. 6.\n\n(3) See footnote 2.\n\n(4) OJ L 107, 30.4.1996, p. 4.\n\n(5) [1988] ECR 4067.\n\n(6) OJ C 175, 24.6.2000, p. 11.\n\n(7) OJ C 74, 10.3.1998, p. 9.\n\n(8) OJ C 28, 1.2.2000, p. 2.\n\n(9) OJ C 19, 20.1.2001, p. 7.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals.
(2) Maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Standing Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs.
(3) In establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue).
(4) For the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues.
(5) In the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey.
(6) Oxolinic acid and flugestone acetate should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.

of 31 July 2014
concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 29 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 6 March 2014, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation and called on the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the areas of their permanent stationing, in accordance with the relevant agreements. They stated that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other hand.
(2) On 17 March 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/145/CFSP concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine (1), whereby the Council imposed travel restrictions and asset freeze measures.
(3) On 21 March 2014, the European Council recalled the statement of the Heads of State or Government of 6 March 2014 and asked the Commission and the Member States to prepare possible targeted measures.
(4) On 27 May, 27 June and 16 July 2014 the Heads of State or Government of the European Union noted that preparatory work by the Commission, the EEAS and the Member States on possible targeted measures was underway so that further steps could be taken without delay.
(5) On 22 July, the Council urged the Russian Federation to actively use its influence over the illegally armed groups in order to achieve full, immediate, safe and secure access to the site of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Donetsk, full cooperation with the work on recovering remains and possessions and full cooperation with the independent investigation, including unhindered access to the site for as long as needed for the investigation and possible follow up investigations.
(6) The Council also urged Russia to stop the increasing flow of weapons, equipment and militants across the border in order to achieve rapid and tangible results in de-escalation. The Council further urged Russia to withdraw its additional troops from the border area.
(7) In addition, the Council recalled the previous commitments by the European Council and expressed readiness to introduce without delay a package of further significant restrictive measures if full and immediate cooperation from Russia on the abovementioned demands failed to materialise. The Council requested the Commission and the EEAS to finalise their preparatory work on possible targeted measures and to present by 24 July proposals for taking action, including on access to capital markets, defence, dual-use goods, and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector.
(8) In view of the gravity of the situation, the Council considers it appropriate to take restrictive measures in response to Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine.
(9) In this context, it is appropriate to prohibit transactions in or the provision of financing or investment services or dealing in new bonds or equity or similar financial instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 days issued by state-owned Russian financial institutions, excluding Russia-based institutions with international status established by intergovernmental agreements with Russia as one of the shareholders. These prohibitions do not affect the granting of loans to or by those state-owned Russian financial institutions independently of their maturity.
(10) In addition, Member States should prohibit the sale, supply, transfer or export to Russia of arms and related materiel of all types. The procurement from Russia of arms and related materiel of all types should also be prohibited.
(11) Furthermore, the sale, supply, transfer or export of dual-use items for military use or to military end-users in Russia should be prohibited. This prohibition should not affect the exports of dual-use goods and technology, including for aeronautics and for the space industry, for non-military use and/or for non-military end-users.
(12) The sale, supply, transfer or export of certain sensitive goods and technologies should be prohibited when they are destined for deep water oil exploration and production, arctic oil exploration and production or shale oil projects.
(13) Further action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain measures.","{'header': '31.7.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 229/13', 'title': ""COUNCIL DECISION\xa02014/512/CFSP\nof 31 July 2014\nconcerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine"", 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 6 March 2014, the Heads of State or Government of the European Union strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation and called on the Russian Federation to immediately withdraw its armed forces to the areas of their permanent stationing, in accordance with the relevant agreements. They stated that any further steps by the Russian Federation to destabilise the situation in Ukraine would lead to additional and far reaching consequences for relations in a broad range of economic areas between the European Union and its Member States, on the one hand, and the Russian Federation, on the other hand.\n\n((2)) On 17 March 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/145/CFSP concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine(1), whereby the Council imposed travel restrictions and asset freeze measures.\n\n((3)) On 21 March 2014, the European Council recalled the statement of the Heads of State or Government of 6 March 2014 and asked the Commission and the Member States to prepare possible targeted measures.\n\n((4)) On 27 May, 27 June and 16 July 2014 the Heads of State or Government of the European\xa0Union noted that preparatory work by the Commission, the EEAS and the Member States on possible targeted measures was underway so that further steps could be taken without delay.\n\n((5)) On 22 July, the Council urged the Russian Federation to actively use its influence over the illegally armed groups in order to achieve full, immediate, safe and secure access to the site of the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight MH17 in Donetsk, full cooperation with the work on recovering remains and possessions and full cooperation with the independent investigation, including unhindered access to the site for as long as needed for the investigation and possible follow up investigations.\n\n((6)) The Council also urged Russia to stop the increasing flow of weapons, equipment and militants across the border in order to achieve rapid and tangible results in de-escalation. The Council further urged Russia to withdraw its additional troops from the border area.\n\n((7)) In addition, the Council recalled the previous commitments by the European Council and expressed readiness to introduce without delay a package of further significant restrictive measures if full and immediate cooperation from Russia on the abovementioned demands failed to materialise. The Council requested the Commission and the EEAS to finalise their preparatory work on possible targeted measures and to present by 24 July proposals for taking action, including on access to capital markets, defence, dual-use goods, and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector.\n\n((8)) In view of the gravity of the situation, the Council considers it appropriate to take restrictive measures in response to Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine.\n\n((9)) In this context, it is appropriate to prohibit transactions in or the provision of financing or investment services or dealing in new bonds or equity or similar financial instruments with a maturity exceeding 90 days issued by state-owned Russian financial institutions, excluding Russia-based institutions with international status established by intergovernmental agreements with Russia as one of the shareholders.

The ACP-EU partnership is founded on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law; these being essential elements of the Agreement and thus forming the basis for relations between us.\nIn this spirit, the European Union has been concerned by the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, particularly after the constitutional referendum in 2001 and the parliamentary elections (2002) and presidential elections (2003). The European Union has also been concerned at the lack of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the lack of good administrative, political, economic and financial governance.\nIt considered that the political situation in Guinea constituted a violation of the essential elements set out in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement. In view of this Article and the political deadlock in Guinea, it decided on 31 March 2004 to open consultations under Article 96 of the Agreement in order to thoroughly review the situation and find a remedy if possible.\nThese consultations began in Brussels on 20 July 2004. On that occasion several fundamental issues were addressed, and you were able to present your point of view and your analysis of the situation in your country. You also presented a memorandum containing an action plan for consolidating democracy, respect for human rights, the rule of law and good governance.\nFollowing the submission of that report a joint follow-up mission (EU Presidency and the Commission) went to Conakry and, in collaboration with EU Member States’ representatives on the spot, evaluated implementation of the undertakings.\nThe European Union notes that the Guinean authorities showed great willingness both to continue and step up talks and to facilitate the EU follow-up mission. It also finds that you have taken promising initiatives in relation to some undertakings. In particular:\nYour government has shown willingness to resume political dialogue with political representatives with a view to revising electoral arrangements. The official ceremony marking the resumption of dialogue took place on 31 August 2004 and an inter-party coordination office was set up to facilitate dialogue.\nThe Government confirmed its decision to organise local elections in June 2005 and to step up decentralisation. A number of draft legislative texts are being drawn up.\nThe Government has confirmed its decision to organise parliamentary elections within the time limits set by the Constitution, i.e. in June 2007. However, the Government is willing to consider the possibility of bringing forward the election date.\nThe Government also confirmed a timetable for liberalisation of the airwaves, which will take effect in June 2005.\nFinally, the Government confirmed sectoral reforms in the field of macroeconomic management together with a timetable for implementation.\nThese initiatives will undoubtedly improve respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in your country. However, most of the undertakings are to be implemented over an extended period and it will be necessary to monitor the implementation of some of them over time, in particular in order to ensure the consolidation of democracy. In this connection, the European Union is anxious for the measures listed in your progress report on implementation of the memorandum of 30 September 2004 to be taken, in particular:\n1.\nContinuing national dialogue in order to review electoral arrangements and operational requirements in accordance with the Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa adopted by the African Union in Durban in 2002\n(\n1\n)\n, with a view to guaranteeing transparent and democratic electoral procedures.\n2.\nContinuing and consolidating the undertaking to comply with the laws on human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular to allow political parties to exercise their rights and prerogatives to hold meetings, to demonstrate and to obtain access to State radio and television broadcasting.\n3.\nLiberalising the electronic media according to the timetable presented to the EU follow-up mission in October 2004 to allow private electronic media to be set up before the local elections.\n4.\nOrganising local and parliamentary elections in line with the amended electoral arrangements.\n5.\nContinuing decentralisation.\n6.\nContinuing measures to enhance macroeconomic management and sectoral reforms.\nFollowing the consultations, and in the light of the undertakings given thus far and the measures still to be implemented, it has been decided that the following appropriate measures under Article 96(2)(c) of the Cotonou Agreement will be adopted.\n1.\nCooperation financed from the unexpended balances of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds will continue for implementation of the undertakings given by Guinea in the context of these consultations, in particular decentralisation, liberalisation of the media and good economic governance.\n2.\nCooperation financed from Envelope B of the ninth European Development Fund will also continue for implementation of the programmes directly aimed at improving the living conditions of the most disadvantaged sections of the population or victims of the subregional political crisis.\n3.\nProgrammes to strengthen civil society (including non-organised forms), respect for and reinforcement of democracy, human rights and good governance and the emergence or consolidation of free media may also be supported.\n4.\nContributions to regional projects will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n5.\nHumanitarian operations, trade cooperation and trade-linked preferences will be continued.\n6.\nSupport will be provided for preparation of the elections, either from the unexpended balances of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds or from Envelope B of the ninth European Development Fund once electoral arrangements guaranteeing a transparent and democratic electoral process based on the Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa have been established.\n7.\nEnvelope A of the ninth EDF, has been reduced by EUR 65 million in line with the decision taken by the European Commission in the context of the mid-term reviews. The Cooperation Strategy and National Indicative Programme will be finalised with due regard for the situation in the country and these new financial perspectives. These documents will be signed and implemented once sufficient progress has been noted in the implementation of the undertakings given by Guinea, in particular as regards the preparation and holding of free and transparent local and parliamentary elections.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 of 19 December 2002 laying down the statute for executive agencies to be entrusted with certain tasks in the management of Community programmes (1), and in particular Article 3 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 empowers the Commission to delegate powers to the executive agencies to implement all or part of a Union programme or project, on its behalf and under its responsibility.
(2) The purpose of entrusting the executive agencies with programme implementation tasks is to enable the Commission to focus on its core activities and functions which cannot be outsourced, without relinquishing control over, or ultimate responsibility for, activities managed by those executive agencies.
(3) In accordance with Article 6 of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020) (2) (hereinafter referred to as the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020), the Commission is to establish a European Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the ERC). The ERC is to succeed the European Research Council which was set up by Commission Decision 2007/134/EC (3) in order to implement Council Decision 2006/972/EC (4) (hereinafter referred to as the Specific Programme Ideas). The ERC is to be composed of an independent Scientific Council (hereinafter referred to as the ERC Scientific Council) and a dedicated implementation structure in the form of an executive agency.
(4) The delegation of tasks related to programme implementation to an executive agency requires clear separation between the programming stages, this being established by the ERC Scientific Council and adopted by the Commission, and programme implementation according to the principles and methodology established by the ERC Scientific Council, which should be entrusted to the executive agency.
(5) By Decision 2008/37/EC (5), the Commission created the European Research Council Executive Agency (hereinafter referred to as the Agency) and entrusted it with the management of Community actions in the field of frontier research with a view to perform the task of implementing the Specific Programme Ideas.
(6) The Agency set up by Decision 2008/37/EC has demonstrated that it has attained a significant reputation within the scientific community across Europe and worldwide. It has established itself as an essential component of the Union’s research funding landscape with good visibility and external perception by stakeholders. The external evaluation of the Agency carried out in accordance with Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that the setting up of the Agency has been beneficial as a result of its scientific specialisation and ability to provide a better service in terms of being close to the beneficiaries, improving the communication and visibility of programmes and ensuring quicker payment to beneficiaries. Savings resulting from the delegation of tasks to the Agency have been estimated at some EUR 45 million over the period 2009-2012.
(7) In its Communication of 29 June 2011‘A budget for Europe 2020’ (6), the Commission proposed to use the option of more extensive recourse to existing executive agencies for the implementation of Union programmes in the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework.
(8) The cost-benefit analysis carried out in accordance with Article 3(1) of Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 has shown that the Commission should entrust the Agency with the implementation of the specific objective ‘strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council’ of Part I ‘Excellent science’ of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020. The Agency has high quality programme management and service delivery, visibility and existing communication outreach channels which have proved effective. The specific objective ‘strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council’ is in line with the current objectives and tasks of the Agency. Making use of the accumulated experience and expertise of the Agency would lead to efficiency gains. Moreover, the Commission has never managed this programme internally and consequently there would be an interruption in business continuity and a lack of know-how. In addition, efficiency gains of EUR 79 million over the period 2014-2024 are to be expected by implementing the agency scenario compared to the in-house scenario where the programme would be managed by the Commission.
(9) The Agency should be entrusted with the management of the specific objective ‘strengthening frontier research through the activities of the European Research Council’ of Part I ‘Excellent science’ of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020, pursuing similar activities which under the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework are already managed by the Agency and which are characterised by projects which do not entail political decision-making and require a high level of scientific and financial expertise throughout the project cycle.
(10) The Agency should continue the implementation of the Specific Programme Ideas which was delegated to it under the 2007-2013 multiannual financial framework.
(11) In order to ensure a consistent implementation in time of this Decision and of the programmes concerned, it is necessary to ensure that the Agency shall exercise its tasks linked to the implementation of those programmes subject to and from the date on which those programmes enter into force.
(12) The Agency should be established. It should replace and succeed the executive agency established by Decision 2008/37/EC. It should operate in accordance with the general statute laid down by Regulation (EC) No 58/2003.
(13) Decision 2008/37/EC should therefore be repealed and transitional provisions should be set out.
(14) The measures provided for by this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Executive Agencies,","{'header': '20.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 346/58', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 December 2013\nestablishing the European Research Council Executive Agency and repealing Decision 2008/37/EC\n(2013/779/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 58/2003 empowers the Commission to delegate powers to the executive agencies to implement all or part of a Union programme or project, on its behalf and under its responsibility.\n\n((2)) The purpose of entrusting the executive agencies with programme implementation tasks is to enable the Commission to focus on its core activities and functions which cannot be outsourced, without relinquishing control over, or ultimate responsibility for, activities managed by those executive agencies.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 6 of the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020 — the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2014-2020)(2)(hereinafter referred to as the Specific Programme implementing Horizon 2020), the Commission is to establish a European Research Council (hereinafter referred to as the ERC).

(1) According to Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.
(2) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006 (2). However, the quantitative limit should be fixed per marketing year in view of the possible opportunities on the export markets.
(3) For certain EU producers of sugar and isoglucose, exports from the Union represent an important part of their economic activities and they have established traditional markets outside the Union. Exports of sugar and isoglucose to those markets could be economically viable also without granting export refunds. To that end it is necessary to fix a quantitative limit for out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose exports so that the EU producers concerned may continue to supply their traditional markets.
(4) For the 2010/2011 marketing year it is estimated that fixing the quantitative limit initially at 650 000 tonnes, in white sugar equivalent, for out-of-quota sugar exports and 50 000 tonnes, in dry matter, for out-of-quota isoglucose would correspond to the market demand.
(5) Exports of sugar from the Union to certain close destinations and to third countries granting EU products a preferential import treatment are currently in a particular favorable competitive position. In view of the absence of appropriate instruments of mutual assistance to fight against irregularities and in order to minimize the risk of fraud and to prevent any abuse associated with the re-import or reintroduction into the Union of out-of-quota sugar certain close destinations should be excluded from the eligible destinations.
(6) In view of the estimated lower risks for eventual frauds regarding isoglucose due to the nature of the product it is not necessary to restrict the eligible destinations for the export of out-of-quota isoglucose.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,","{'header': '8.5.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 115/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 397/2010\nof 7 May 2010\nfixing the quantitative limit for exports of out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose until the end of the 2010/2011 marketing year', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 61, first paragraph, point (d) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007, the sugar or isoglucose produced in excess of the quota referred to in Article 56 of that Regulation may be exported only within the quantitative limit to be fixed.\n\n((2)) Detailed implementing rules for out-of-quota exports, in particular concerning the issue of export licences are laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 951/2006(2).

Whereas the 1983/85 programme preceded the presentation to the Commission of an expert study of the Community market for trout and carp;
Whereas on 13 January 1986 the German Government forwarded a prolongation of the multiannual guidance programme in respect of aquaculture;
Whereas, in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 2908/83, the time required for the execution of the programme covers at least the proposed duration of the common measure;
Whereas the programme contains the information referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2908/83;
Whereas a feature of aquaculture in Germany is the very slight development of fish farming in sea waters; whereas almost all fish farming in Germany is carried out in fresh water and mainly involves the rearing of trout and carp;
Whereas the programme proposes chiefly to rationalize and develop trout and carp rearing and, to a lesser extent, to increase freshwater production of other species;
Whereas the Commission cannot approve that part of the programme relating to trout and carp in view of the difficult situation in the Community for these products, except for certain projects to modernize existing installations, particularly those which reduce pollution and mortality rates;
Whereas the programme may, having regard to production potential, the demand for the products concerned and the guidelines of the common fisheries policy, constitute a suitable framework for projects which may qualify for financial support from the Community;

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 of 20 July 1998 amending Regulation No 136/66/EEC on the establishment of a common organisation of the market in oils and fats(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1513/2001(2), and in particular Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under the intervention arrangements, prior to 1 November 1998, sales by tender of olive oil were carried out by the Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies. Those arrangements were repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1638/98 with effect from 1 November 1998. A quantity of vat bottom residues are still held in stock by those intervention agencies. These residues contain a considerable percentage of oil. To ensure a smooth transition from the intervention arrangements to the present situation in which those arrangements no longer exist, the sale of the olive oil bought in by the intervention agencies under the arrangements now repealed and still held in stock should be authorised.
(2) Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 of 23 November 1978 on intervention in the olive oil sector(3), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2203/90(4), provides that Community olive oil held by the intervention agencies is to be put up for sale by tender except when particular conditions necessitate recourse to other procedures.
(3) For commercial reasons based chiefly on the fact that there is no well-defined market or price system for the product in question, it is not possible to use the sale by tender procedure. The Spanish, Greek and Italian intervention agencies should therefore sell the product at the best price they can obtain whilst ensuring that Article 2(2) of Regulation (EEC) No 2754/78 is complied with. A second sale may be envisaged if the product remains totally or partly unsold after the first sale.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 of 3 November 1998 on the common organisation of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1669/2000(2), and in particular Article 5(6) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Canary Islands with regard to certain agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999(4), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 5(1) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 provides for the grant of a premium to compensate for any loss of income sustained by producers of sheepmeat and, in certain areas, of goatmeat. Those areas are defined in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and in Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2738/1999 of 21 December 1999 determining the mountain areas in which the premium for goatmeat producers is granted(5).
(2) Pursuant to Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98 and to enable an advance payment to be made to sheepmeat and goatmeat producers, the foreseeable loss of income should be estimated in the light of the foreseeable trend in market prices.
(3) Pursuant to Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the amount of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs is obtained by multiplying the loss of income referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 of that Article by a coefficient expressing the annual average production of heavy lamb meat per ewe producing these lambs expressed per 100 kilograms of carcass weight. The coefficient for 2000 has not yet been fixed in view of the lack of full Community statistics. Pending the fixing of that coefficient, a provisional coefficient should be used. Article 5(3) of that Regulation fixes the coefficient for producers of light lambs at 80 % of the coefficient for producers of heavy lambs. Article 5(5) of that Regulation also fixes the amount per female for producers of the caprine species at 80 % of the premium per ewe for producers of heavy lambs.
(4) Pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the premium must be reduced by the impact on the basic price of the coefficient provided for in paragraph 2 of that Article. That coefficient is fixed by Article 13(4) at 7 %.
(5) In accordance with Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98, the half-yearly advance payment is fixed at 30 % of the expected premium. In accordance with Article 5(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2700/93(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1410/1999(7), the advance payment is to be paid only if it is equal to or greater than EUR 1.
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 provides for the application of specific measures relating to agricultural production in the Canary Islands. Those measures entail the grant of a supplement to the ewe premium to producers of light lambs and she-goats on the same conditions as those governing the grant of the premium referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2467/98. Those conditions provide that Spain is authorised to pay an advance on the said supplementary premium.
(7) For budgetary reasons, the second advance to the premium may not be paid before 16 October 2000.

After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
1.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 925/2009 (2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain aluminium foil originating, inter alia, in the People’s Republic of China (‘the PRC’) (‘the existing measures’).
(2) On 24 September 2012, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) received a request pursuant to Article 13(3) and 14(5) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the existing measures and to make imports of aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,008 mm and not more than 0,018 mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in rolls which are not annealed, of a width exceeding 650 mm and of a weight exceeding 10 kg and currently falling within CN code ex 7607 11 19 (TARIC code 7607111920), originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the product under investigation’) subject to registration.
(3) The request was lodged by Symetal SA, Eurofoil Luxembourg SA, Alcomet and Hydro Aluminium Rolled Products GmbH, four Union producers of aluminium foil.
(4) The request contained prima facie evidence that the existing measures are being circumvented by means of imports of the product under investigation and its subsequent conversion into aluminum foil in rolls of a width not exceeding 650 mm, being the product subject to the existing measures.
(5) Pursuant to Article 13(3) and Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, by Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 (3) initiated an investigation and directed the customs authorities to register imports of the product under investigation.
(6) Questionnaires were sent to nine exporting producers and to the authorities in the PRC. Neither the exporting producers nor the authorities in the PRC came forward and submitted a questionnaire reply. Questionnaires were also sent to sixteen importers in the Union. Only one importer came forward but did not submit a questionnaire reply.
2.   WITHDRAWAL OF THE REQUEST AND TERMINATION OF THE INVESTIGATION
(7) By letters of 3 and 4 April 2013 to the Commission, the four Union producers formally withdrew their request to investigate the possible circumvention of the existing measures.
(8) Under Article 9(1) and Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation, the investigation may be terminated where the request is withdrawn, unless such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(9) The Commission considered that the present investigation should be terminated since the investigation had not brought to light any considerations showing that such termination would not be in the Union interest. Interested parties were informed accordingly and were given the opportunity to comment. No comments were received indicating that such termination would not be in the Union interest.
(10) The Commission therefore concludes that the investigation concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People’s Republic of China by imports of certain aluminium foil in rolls which are not annealed and of a width exceeding 650 mm originating in the People’s Republic of China should be terminated.
(11) The registration of imports of the product under investigation introduced by Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 should therefore be discontinued and Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 be repealed,","{'header': '3.7.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 184/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 638/2013\nof 2 July 2013\nterminating the investigation concerning possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 925/2009 on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People’s Republic of China by imports of certain aluminium foil in rolls which are not annealed and of a width exceeding 650\xa0mm originating in the People’s Republic of China', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe investigation initiated by Regulation (EU) No 973/2012 concerning the possible circumvention of anti-dumping measures imposed by Regulation (EC) No 925/2009 on imports of certain aluminium foil originating in the People’s Republic of China by imports of aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,008\xa0mm and not more than 0,018\xa0mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in rolls which are not annealed, of a width exceeding 650\xa0mm and of a weight exceeding 10\xa0kg and currently falling within CN code ex\xa07607\xa011\xa019  (TARIC code 7607\xa011\xa019\xa020), originating in the People’s Republic of China, is hereby terminated.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nCustoms authorities shall discontinue the registration of imports established in accordance to Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 973/2012.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nRegulation (EU) No 973/2012 is hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

DEFINITIONS\n\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply to the longitudinal component of EU-SILC:\n\n(a) Initial sample: refers to the sample of households or persons at the time it is selected for inclusion in EU-SILC.\n\n(b) Sample persons: means all or a subset of the members of the households in the initial sample who are over a certain age.\n\n(c) Age limit used to define sample persons:\n\nIn the case of a four-year panel, this age limit shall not be higher than 14 years. In countries with a four-year panel using a sample of addresses or households, all household members aged 14 and over in the initial sample shall be sample persons. In countries with a four-year panel using a sample of persons, this shall mean selecting at least one such person per household.\n\nThe abovementioned minimum age limit shall be lower in the case of a longer panel duration. For a panel duration exceeding eight years, members of all ages in the initial sample shall be sample persons, and children born to sample women during the time the mother is in the panel shall be included as sample persons.\n\n(d) Sample household: means a household containing at least one sample person. A sample household shall be included in EU-SILC for the collection or compilation of detailed information where it contains at least one sample person aged 16 or more.\n\n(e) Co-residents (non-sample persons): are all current residents of a sample household other than those defined above as sample persons.\n\n(f) Current household members: means current members of the household at the time of data collection or compilation. The conditions for classifying a person as a household member are laid down in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1980/2003(1) on definitions and updated definitions.\n\n(g) Former household member: refers to a person who is not a current household member and was not recorded as a household member in that household in the previous wave, but who lived in the household for at least three months during the income reference period.\n\n(h) Entire household:\n\nA sample household is said to be entire (whole) if it remains as one household, without forming an additional household and without the household disappearing, even though there may have been changes in its composition from the previous wave due to deaths, members moving out of scope or co-residents leaving the household, people joining the household or births.\n\n(i) Initial/Split-off household:\n\nSample household from wave x is said to have been ""split"" if its sample persons from wave x reside at the time of wave x+1 in more than one private household within the national territories included in the target population.\n\nWhen a split has occurred, one (and only one) of the resulting households shall be defined as the ""initial"" household, while one or more of the others are termed ""split-off"" households.\n\nThe following approach shall be used in order to distinguish between ""initial"" and ""split-off"" households:\n\n- if any sample person of the wave x still lives at the same address as the last wave, then his/her household shall be defined as the ""initial"" household. All sample persons who have moved shall form one or more ""split-off"" households,\n\n- if no sample person lives at the address of the last wave, then the household of the sample person who had the lowest person number in the register for the last wave shall be the initial household. Where this person is no longer alive or in a private household within the national territory of the target population, the initial household shall be the household of the sample person with the lowest person number.\n\n(j) Fusion:\n\nSample persons from different sample households from the previous wave join together to form a new household.\n\nFor the cross-sectional and longitudinal component of EU-SILC, the following definition shall apply:\n\n(k) Person number: refers to the number assigned in the ""household register"" to the person the first time he/she is recorded as a household member. In the cross-sectional component, and in new households in the longitudinal component, it should correspond to the person\'s line position in the ""household register"".\n\n2. IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS FOR PERSONS AND HOUSEHOLDS\n\n2.1. Household identification number\n\n1. In the cross-sectional component, the household fixed identification number (ID) is a sequential number.\n\n2. In the longitudinal component, the household identification number (ID) is composed of the household number and the split number. The household number is a sequential number. The split number for the first wave shall always take the value ""00"".\n\nWhere the household remains entire, it shall keep the household number and split number from one wave to the next.\n\nIn the case of a split-off, the initial household shall keep the household number and split number from one wave to the next. The other households, i.e. split-off households, shall keep the same household number, but shall be assigned the next available unique split number in sequence.\n\nIn the case of a fusion of two sample households, if the new household is still at a previous address, it shall retain the household number and split number of the household that was at that address in the previous wave. If the new household is at a new address, the household number and split number of the household of the sample person who now has the lowest person number in the ""household register"" shall be used.\n\n2.2. Personal identification number\n\n1. In the cross-sectional and longitudinal components, the personal identification number is composed of the household ID and the person number.\n\n2. In the longitudinal component, the person number for any new person in the household shall be constructed by adding 1 to the highest person number used, for all the years of the survey and the household ID.\n\n3. For the longitudinal component, the household ID shall be the household identification number of the household where the person first appears in the panel.\n\n4. In the longitudinal component, the personal ID shall remain fixed over the length of time the person is in the survey.\n\n3. INFORMATION TO BE COLLECTED\n\n1. In the initial household, the full information required for current household members, the basic information for former household members and the basic information on household members in the previous wave that are no longer household members shall be collected.\n\n2. In the split-off household, only the full information required for current household members shall be collected.\n\n3. The full information required for current household members, the basic information for former household members and the basic information on household members in the previous wave that are no longer household members is set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1983/2003(2)in the list of target primary variables.\n\n4. Where a sample person is in the survey for more than one year, information shall be obtained on whether that person remained at the same address or moved to a different address from one year to the next.\n\n4. RESPONDENT TO THE HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE\n\n1. Interview information relating to the whole household and general information on each household member shall be provided by (one or more) members of the household. The household respondent shall be chosen according to the following priorities:\n\n- Priority 1: the person responsible for the accommodation.\n\n- Priority 2: a household member aged 16 or over, who is best placed to give the information.\n\n2. For the second and following waves of the longitudinal component of EU-SILC, the household respondent shall be chosen according to the following list of priorities:\n\n- Priority 1: the household respondent in the last wave.\n\n- Priority 2: a ""sample person"" aged 16 or over, giving priority to the person responsible for the accommodation or best placed to give the information.\n\n- Priority 3: a ""non-sample person"" aged 16 or over.\n\n5. SAMPLE IMPLEMENTATION\n\n1. Each Member State shall follow appropriate procedures to maximise the response rates achieved, in accordance with its own ""best practices"". In the case of an interview survey, at least three call-backs shall be made before a household or individual is accepted as non-responding, unless there are conclusive reasons (such as a definite refusal to cooperate, circumstances endangering the safety of the interviewer, etc.) why this cannot be done.\n\n2. EU-SILC shall be based on the selection and implementation of a probability sample. As a rule, the units enumerated in the survey shall be exactly the same units as those selected for the purpose in accordance with the sampling design, i.e. not substituted for by other units.\n\n3. Records shall be kept of the outcome of each household and person selected for the sample, distinguishing (i) eligible units successfully enumerated, (ii) eligible units not successfully enumerated, (iii) selected units not found to be eligible for the survey and (iv) units not successfully enumerated where the eligibility status could not be determined. Reasons for the failure to enumerate successfully eligible units shall be recorded, identifying at least the main categories such as non-contact, refusal and incapacity to respond (such as being ill). Circumstances of units found to be ineligible or in the uncertain eligibility category shall also be recorded.\n\n4. The proxy rate shall be kept as limited as possible for the income personal variables and for any variables required for at least one household member aged 16 or more.\n\n5. In the cross-sectional component and in the first year of each panel constituting the longitudinal component, controlled substitutions may be allowed only where the response rate falls below 60 % and one of the following situations arises:\n\n- address non-contacted because it cannot be located or is inaccessible,\n\n- address contacted but interview not completed because the household refuses to cooperate, the entire household is temporarily away or the household is unable to respond.\n\nNo substitutions shall be allowed for second and subsequent waves of a panel in the longitudinal component.\n\nProcedures shall be followed to ensure that the process of substitution is controlled to the maximum extent possible. These include the use of a design which ensures that substitutes are selected so as to match the substituted units closely for important characteristics. The substitutions shall be allowed only after special efforts have been made to convince refusals, and properly scheduled call-backs have been made to other non-respondents. A household shall not be substituted by another non-sample household at the same address.\n\n6. SURVEY DURATION AND TIMING\n\n1. The interval between the end of the income reference period and the time of the interview for the respondent concerned shall be limited to eight months as far as possible. This applies both to the household and personal samples, and irrespective of whether the reference period used is fixed in terms of calendar dates for the whole sample or is a moving reference period determined according to the timing of the interview for the household or person concerned.\n\n2. By way of exception to paragraph 1, if the income variables are collected from registers the interval between the end of the income reference period and the time of interview for current variables shall be limited to 12 months.\n\n3. Where all the data are collected through field interviewing and a fixed income reference period is used, the total duration of the data collection of the sample shall be limited to four months as far as possible.\n\n4. Where the data are collected through field interviewing using a moving income reference period and the fieldwork duration exceeds three months, the total annual sample shall be shared approximately equally between the fieldwork months. In this case, the total fieldwork duration for the cross-sectional component and each wave of the longitudinal component shall not exceed 12 months.\n\n5. For the longitudinal component, the collection or compilation of data, for a given unit (household or person), between successive waves shall be kept as close as possible to 12 months.\n\n7. IMPUTATION PROCEDURES\n\n7.1. Kinds of missing data\n\n1. Coverage and sample selection errors: for instance, where units in the target population are not represented in the sampling frame, or where the unit selection probabilities are distorted, or other sample selection errors occur.\n\n2. Unit non-response: refers to absence of information on whole units (households and/or persons) selected into the sample.\n\n3. Partial unit non-response: describes the situation where some but not all household members eligible and selected for the individual interview have been successfully enumerated.\n\n4. Item non-response: refers to the situation where a sample unit has been successfully enumerated, but not all the required information has been obtained.\n\n7.2. Characteristics of an imputation procedure\n\nTwo types of approaches (which may be used in combination) could be applied to the data:\n\n- Imputation: refers to the generation of missing information on the basis of statistical relationships internal to the data set.\n\n- Modelling: makes use of substantive relationships and information external to the data set.\n\nThe procedure applied to the data should preserve variation of and correlation between variables. Methods that incorporate ""error components"" into the imputed values shall be preferable to those that simply impute a predicted value.\n\nMethods which take into account the correlation structure (or other characteristics of the joint distribution of the variables) shall be preferable to the marginal or univariate approach.\n\n(1) See page 1 of this Official Journal.\n\n(2) See page 34 of this Official Journal.'}]}"

of 17 December 2013
on the Cohesion Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the second paragraph of Article 177 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (2),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) The first paragraph of Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the Union is to develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion. The Cohesion Fund which is established by this Regulation should, therefore, provide a financial contribution to projects in the fields of environment and trans-European networks in the area of transport infrastructure.
(2) Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3) sets out provisions common to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. That Regulation constitutes a new framework for the European Structural and Investment Funds including the Cohesion Fund. It is necessary, therefore, to specify the tasks of the Cohesion Fund in relation to that framework and in relation to the purpose assigned to the Cohesion Fund in the TFEU.
(3) Specific provisions concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the Cohesion Fund, in order to contribute to the investment priorities within the thematic objectives set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, should be laid down.
(4) The Union should be able to contribute, through the Cohesion Fund, to actions in pursuit of its environmental objectives, in accordance with Articles 11 and 191 TFEU, namely energy efficiency and renewable energy and, in the transport sector outside the trans-European networks, rail, river and sea transport, intermodal transport systems and their interoperability, management of road, sea and air traffic, clean urban transport and public transport.
(5) It should be recalled that where measures based on Article 192(1) TFEU involve costs deemed disproportionate for the public authorities of a Member State and financial support from the Cohesion Fund is provided in accordance with Article 192(5) TFEU, the polluter pays principle is nevertheless to apply.
(6) Trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects supported by the Cohesion Fund are to comply with the guidelines established in Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4). In order to concentrate efforts in that regard, priority should be given to projects of common interest as defined in that Regulation.
(7) Investment to achieve the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) should not be eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as it already benefits financially from the application of that Directive. That exclusion should not restrict the possibility of using the Cohesion Fund to support activities that are not listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC even if those activities are implemented by the same economic operators, and include activities such as energy efficiency investment in the co-generation of heat and power and in district heating networks, smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems and measures aimed at reducing air pollution, even if one of the indirect effects of such activities is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or if they are listed in the national plan referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.
(8) It is not possible for investment in housing, other than that related to the promotion of energy efficiency or renewable energy use, to be eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as it falls outside the scope of support from the Cohesion Fund as defined in the TFEU.
(9) In order to accelerate the development of transport infrastructure across the Union, the Cohesion Fund should support transport infrastructure projects of European added value provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) for a total amount of EUR 10 000 000 000. The allocation of support from the Cohesion Fund to those projects should comply with the rules established under Article 92(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, support should be available only to Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund, with the co-financing rates applicable to that Fund.
(10) It is important to ensure that, in promoting risk management investment, specific risks at regional, cross-border and transnational level are taken into account.
(11) Complementarity and synergies between interventions supported by the Cohesion Fund, the ERDF, the European territorial cooperation goal and the Connecting Europe Facility should be ensured, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to guarantee the optimal linkage of different types of infrastructure at local, regional and national level, and throughout the Union.
(12) In order to address the specific needs of the Cohesion Fund, and in line with the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, it is necessary to set out within each thematic objective laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Cohesion Fund-specific actions as 'investment priorities'. Those investment priorities should set out detailed objectives, which are not mutually exclusive, to which the Cohesion Fund is to contribute. Such investment priorities should form the basis for the definition of specific objectives within operational programmes that take into account the needs and characteristics of the programme area. In order to increase flexibility and reduce the administrative burden through joint implementation, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund investment priorities under the corresponding thematic objectives should be aligned.
(13) A common set of output indicators to assess the aggregated progress at Union level of the implementation of operational programmes should be set out in an Annex to this Regulation. Those indicators should correspond to the investment priority and type of action supported in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. The common output indicators should be complemented by programme-specific result indicators and, where relevant, by programme-specific output indicators.
(14) In order to amend this Regulation with regard to certain non-essential elements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the list of common output indicators set out in Annex I to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.
(15) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union in the interests of promoting sustainable development, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the extent of the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions and the limit on the financial resources of the Member States and regions, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(16) Since this Regulation replaces Council Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006 (7), that Regulation should be repealed. However, this Regulation should not affect either the continuation or modification of assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006 or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013. That Regulation or such other applicable legislation should consequently continue to apply after 31 December 2013 to that assistance or the operations concerned until their closure. Applications to receive assistance made or approved under Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006 should remain valid.
(17) In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union,","{'header': '20.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 347/281', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 1300/2013 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 17 December 2013\non the Cohesion Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1084/2006', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The first paragraph of Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that the Union is to develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion.

It is necessary, therefore, to specify the tasks of the Cohesion Fund in relation to that framework and in relation to the purpose assigned to the Cohesion Fund in the TFEU.\n\n((3)) Specific provisions concerning the type of activities which can be supported by the Cohesion Fund, in order to contribute to the investment priorities within the thematic objectives set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, should be laid down.\n\n((4)) The Union should be able to contribute, through the Cohesion Fund, to actions in pursuit of its environmental objectives, in accordance with Articles 11 and 191 TFEU, namely energy efficiency and renewable energy and, in the transport sector outside the trans-European networks, rail, river and sea transport, intermodal transport systems and their interoperability, management of road, sea and air traffic, clean urban transport and public transport.\n\n((5)) It should be recalled that where measures based on Article 192(1) TFEU involve costs deemed disproportionate for the public authorities of a Member State and financial support from the Cohesion Fund is provided in accordance with Article 192(5) TFEU, the polluter pays principle is nevertheless to apply.\n\n((6)) Trans-European transport network (TEN-T) projects supported by the Cohesion Fund are to comply with the guidelines established in Regulation (EU) No 1315/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4). In order to concentrate efforts in that regard, priority should be given to projects of common interest as defined in that Regulation.\n\n((7)) Investment to achieve the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from activities listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)should not be eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as it already benefits financially from the application of that Directive. That exclusion should not restrict the possibility of using the Cohesion Fund to support activities that are not listed in Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC even if those activities are implemented by the same economic operators, and include activities such as energy efficiency investment in the co-generation of heat and power and in district heating networks, smart energy distribution, storage and transmission systems and measures aimed at reducing air pollution, even if one of the indirect effects of such activities is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, or if they are listed in the national plan referred to in Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\n((8)) It is not possible for investment in housing, other than that related to the promotion of energy efficiency or renewable energy use, to be eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as it falls outside the scope of support from the Cohesion Fund as defined in the TFEU.\n\n((9)) In order to accelerate the development of transport infrastructure across the Union, the Cohesion Fund should support transport infrastructure projects of European added value provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council(6)for a total amount of EUR\xa010\xa0000\xa0000\xa0000. The allocation of support from the Cohesion Fund to those projects should comply with the rules established under Article 92(6) of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, support should be available only to Member States eligible for funding from the Cohesion Fund, with the co-financing rates applicable to that Fund.\n\n((10)) It is important to ensure that, in promoting risk management investment, specific risks at regional, cross-border and transnational level are taken into account.\n\n((11)) Complementarity and synergies between interventions supported by the Cohesion Fund, the ERDF, the European territorial cooperation goal and the Connecting Europe Facility should be ensured, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to guarantee the optimal linkage of different types of infrastructure at local, regional and national level, and throughout the Union.\n\n((12)) In order to address the specific needs of the Cohesion Fund, and in line with the Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, it is necessary to set out within each thematic objective laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013, the Cohesion Fund-specific actions as 'investment priorities'. Those investment priorities should set out detailed objectives, which are not mutually exclusive, to which the Cohesion Fund is to contribute. Such investment priorities should form the basis for the definition of specific objectives within operational programmes that take into account the needs and characteristics of the programme area. In order to increase flexibility and reduce the administrative burden through joint implementation, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund investment priorities under the corresponding thematic objectives should be aligned.\n\n((13)) A common set of output indicators to assess the aggregated progress at Union level of the implementation of operational programmes should be set out in an Annex to this Regulation. Those indicators should correspond to the investment priority and type of action supported in accordance with this Regulation and the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. The common output indicators should be complemented by programme-specific result indicators and, where relevant, by programme-specific output indicators.\n\n((14)) In order to amend this Regulation with regard to certain non-essential elements, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the amendment of the list of common output indicators set out in Annex I to this Regulation. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and the Council.\n\n((15)) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to strengthen the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union in the interests of promoting sustainable development, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the extent of the disparities between the levels of development of the various regions and the backwardness of the least favoured regions and the limit on the financial resources of the Member States and regions, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.\n\n((16)) Since this Regulation replaces Council Regulation (EC) No\xa01084/2006(7), that Regulation should be repealed. However, this Regulation should not affect either the continuation or modification of assistance approved by the Commission on the basis of Regulation (EC) No\xa01084/2006 or any other legislation applying to that assistance on 31 December 2013. That Regulation or such other applicable legislation should consequently continue to apply after 31 December 2013 to that assistance or the operations concerned until their closure. Applications to receive assistance made or approved under Regulation (EC) No\xa01084/2006 should remain valid.\n\n((17)) In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1',

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the Danish Government has submitted to the Commission on 25 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Lolland; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under  this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on  arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds  (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (2), stipulates that in the Commission Decisions  approving a Single Programming Document, the Community assistance available for the entire period  and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each  Decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be  compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to  Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding  to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the  technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget  of the European Communities (7), as last amended by Regulation (ECSC, EC, Euratom) No 2730/94 (8),  states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial  year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due  form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a  single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole  programmation period;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been  complied with,","{'title': '94/1005/EC: Commission Decision of 9 December 1994 on the approval of the Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance in the region of Lolland concerned by Objective 2 in Denmark (Only the Danish text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Single Programming Document for Community structural assistance  in the region of Lolland concerned by Objective 2 in Denmark, covering the period 1 January 1994 to  31 December 1996, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Single Programming Document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an  appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional  policies in Denmark;\n\nthe main priority is:\n\nbusiness development;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the Single Programming Document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the financial implementation provisions,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality and an initial evaluation of the latter;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the  Single Programming Document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or  adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nFor the purpose of indexation, the annual breakdown of the global maximal allocation  foreseen for the assistance from the Structural Funds is as follows:\n\n>TABLE>'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThe assistance from the Structural Funds granted to the Single  Programming Document amounts to a maximum of ECU 9,52 million.\n\nThe procedure for granting the financial assistance, including the financial contribution from the  Funds to the various priorities and measures, is set out in the financing plan and the detailed  implementing provisions which form an integral part of the Single Programming Document.\n\nThe national financial contribution envisaged, which is approximately ECU 9,6 million for the  public sector and ECU 10,3 million for the private sector, may be met in part by Community loans,  in particular from the ECSC and EIB.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine (1), and in particular Article 33(1)(f) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 provides for the possibility of a crisis distillation measure in the event of exceptional market disturbance due to major surpluses. Such measures may be limited to certain categories of wine and/or certain areas of production, and may apply to quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr) at the request of the Member State concerned.
(2) By letter of 11 July 2005, the Hungarian Government requested that crisis distillation be opened for table wine produced in Hungary and for quality wines psr.
(3) Considerable surpluses have been recorded on the market in table wine and quality wines psr in Hungary, which are reflected in a fall in prices and a worrying rise in stocks towards the end of the 2004/05 marketing year. In order to reverse this negative trend, and so remedy the difficult market situation, stocks of Hungarian wine should be reduced to a level that can be regarded as normal in terms of covering market requirements.
(4) Since the conditions laid down in Article 30(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 are satisfied, a crisis distillation measure should be opened for a maximum of 400 000 hectolitres of table wine and 100 000 hectolitres of quality wines produced in specified regions (quality wines psr).
(5) The crisis distillation opened by this Regulation must comply with the conditions laid down by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 of 25 July 2000 laying down detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine with regard to market mechanisms (2), as regards the distillation measure provided for in Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. Other provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1623/2000 must also apply, in particular those concerning the delivery of alcohol to intervention agencies and the payment of advances.
(6) The price distillers must pay producers should be set at a level that permits the market disturbance to be dealt with by allowing producers to take advantage of the possibility afforded by this measure.
(7) The product of crisis distillation must be raw or neutral alcohol only, for compulsory delivery to the intervention agency in order to avoid disturbing the market for potable alcohol, which is supplied largely by the distillation provided for in Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999.

Having regard to Council Directive 75/322/EEC of 20 May 1975 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the suppression of radio interference produced by spark-ignition engines fitted to wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors(3), as last amended by Directive 97/54/EC, and in particular Article 5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 75/322/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval procedure which was established pursuant to Directive 74/150/EEC. Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 74/150/EEC applicable to systems, components and separate technical units apply to Directive 75/322/EEC.
(2) Directive 75/322/EEC contains the earliest measures endeavouring to bring about a basic electromagnetic compatibility regarding radio interference. Subsequently, technical progress has increased the complexity and diversity of electrical and electronic equipment.
(3) To take account of the increasing concern about the technological developments in electrical and electronic equipment and the need to ensure the general compatibility of different electrical and electronic equipment, Council Directive 89/336/EEC(4), as last amended by Directive 93/68/EEC(5), laid down general provisions regarding electromagnetic compatibility for all products not covered by a specific directive.
(4) Directive 89/336/EEC established the principle that, in so far as protection requirements specified in that Directive were harmonised, its general provisions would not apply or would cease to apply with regard to apparatus covered by specified directives.
(5) Directive 75/322/EEC should become such a specific directive.
(6) The adaptation to technical progress was effected, in the case of motor vehicles, by Commission Directive 95/54/EC(6) relating to the suppression of radio interference produced by spark-ignition engines fitted to motor vehicles. Equivalent requirements must now be adopted on the suppression of radio interference produced by engines fitted to agricultural or forestry tractors, by establishing a specific directive within the framework of the type-approval procedure which provides for approvals granted by designated national authorities on the basis of harmonised technical requirements.
(7) From 1 October 2001 the technical requirements relating to the radio interference (electromagnetic compatibility) of vehicles, their components and systems should be governed solely by the provisions of Directive 75/322/EEC.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 43  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Whereas molluscs are listed in Annex II to the Treaty; whereas the marketing of molluscs  constitutes an important source of revenue for the aquaculture sector;
Whereas the mollusc diseases referred to in Annex A, list II, to Council Directive 91/67/EEC of 28  January 1991 concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of  aquaculture animals and products (3), have a very serious effect on the shellfish industry; whereas  other diseases having a similar effect occur in third countries, whereas a list of such diseases  should be drawn up and the Commission should be given the ability to adjust that list in the light  of developments in the animal-health field;
Whereas an outbreak of such diseases can quickly take on epizootic proportions, causing mortality  and disturbances on a scale liable considerably to reduce the profitability of shellfish-farming;
Whereas it is therefore necessary to establish at Community level the measures to be taken in the  event of outbreaks of disease, in order to ensure rational development of shellfish-farming and to  contribute to the protection of animal health in the Community;
Whereas Member States should report to the Commission and the other Member States all cases of  abnormal mortality observed in bivalve molluscs;
Whereas, in such an event, measures must be taken aimed at preventing the spread of the disease, in  particular with regard to the removal of live bivalve molluscs from the farms or zones concerned;
Whereas a thorough epidemiological investigation is essential to determine the origin of the  disease and to prevent further spread;
Whereas, in order to ensure an effective system of control, diagnosis of the diseases must be  harmonized and carried out under the auspices of responsible laboratories, the coordination of  which may be ensured by a reference laboratory designated by the Community;
Whereas, in order to ensure uniform implementation of this Directive, a Community inspection  procedure should be established;
Whereas common measures for the control of diseases form a minimum basis for maintaining a uniform  standard of animal health;
Whereas the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting the necessary implementing  measures,","{'title': 'Council Directive 95/70/EC of 22 December 1995 introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain diseases affecting bivalve molluscs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Directive establishes minimum Community measures for the control  of the diseases affecting bivalve molluscs referred to in this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

(2) The government of Poland and the Commission, acting on behalf of the European Community, signed on 25 January 2001 the Multiannual Financing Agreement laying down the technical, legal and administrative framework for the execution of the Sapard programme, as last amended by the Annual Financing Agreement for 2003, signed on 4 June 2003 which finally entered into force on 10 June 2003.
(3) A Sapard agency has been appointed by the competent authority of the Republic of Poland for the implementation of some of the measures defined in the Sapard. The Ministry of Finance, National Fund, has been appointed for the financial functions it is due to perform in the framework of the implementation of the Sapard.
(4) On the basis of a case-by-case analysis of the national and sectorial programme/project management capacity, financial control procedures and structures regarding public finance, as provided for in Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999, the Commission adopted Decision 2002/539/EC of 2 July 2002 conferring management of aid on implementing agencies for preaccession measures in agriculture and rural development in the Republic of Poland in the preaccession period(5) with regard to certain measures provided for in the Sapard.
(5) The Commission has since undertaken a further analysis under Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 in respect of Measure 4 ""Diversification of economic activities in rural areas"" (hereinafter ""Measure 4"") as provided for in the Sapard. The Commission considers that, also with regard to that measure, the Republic of Poland complies with the provisions of Articles 4 to 6 and of the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000 of 7 June 2000 laying down financial rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 on Community support for preaccession measures for agriculture and rural development in the applicant countries of central and eastern Europe in the preaccession period(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 188/2003(7), and with the minimum conditions set out in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to waive the ex ante approval requirement provided for in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 and to confer, with regard to Measure 4, on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund in the Republic of Poland, the management of aid on a decentralised basis.
(7) Since the verifications carried out by the Commission for Measure 4 are based on a system that is not yet fully operating with regard to all relevant elements, however, it is appropriate to confer the management of the Sapard on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund, according to Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2222/2000, on a provisional basis.
(8) Full conferral of management of the Sapard is only envisaged after further verifications to ensure that the system operates satisfactorily have been carried out and after any recommendations which the Commission may issue with regard to the conferral of management of aid on the Agency for Restructuring and Modernisation of Agriculture, and on the National Fund, have been implemented.
(9) On 27 October 2003 the Polish Authorities proposed the rules for eligibility of expenditure in accordance with Article 4(1) of Section B of the Multiannual Financing Agreement.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed(1), and in particular Article 8(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 1999/29/EC on the undesirable substances and products in animal nutrition(2), as amended by Directive 2001/102/EC(3), establishes maximum levels for dioxins in several feed materials and compound feedingstuffs.
(2) Directive 2002/32/EC repeals and replaces Directive 1999/29/EC with effect from 1 August 2003.
(3) It is of major importance for public and animal health protection that the maximum levels for dioxins established by Directive 1999/29/EC remain in force after 1 August 2003. Directive 2002/32/EC should therefore be amended in order to include the maximum levels for dioxins, established by Directive 1999/29/EC.
(4) In order to avoid any confusion it is appropriate to specify that minerals refer to the feed materials in the meaning of the Annex of Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation and use of feed materials(4) as last amended by Directive 2001/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(5).
(5) For greater clarity the rules governing dioxins should be collected in a single text. As a result, it is appropriate to amend Directive 2002/32/EC by inserting as an annex thereto the provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2439/1999 of 17 November 1999 on the conditions for the authorisation of additives belonging to the group ""binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants"" in feedingstuffs(6), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 739/2000(7), which establishes a provisional maximum limit for kaolinitic clays and other additives authorised for use as binders, anti-caking agents and coagulants. As no or insufficient monitoring data on the presence of dioxins have been provided for calcium sulphate dihydrate, vermiculite, natrolite-phonolite, synthetic calcium aluminates and clinoptilolite of sedimentary origin demonstrating the absence of contamination by dioxins or contamination at levels below the limit of quantification, it is therefore appropriate in order to protect animal and human health to establish for these additives a maximum level for dioxins in addition to the maximum level for dioxins in kaolinitic clay. As a result, Regulation (EC) 2439/1999 can be repealed.
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2003/57/EC of 17 June 2003 amending Directive 2002/ 32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on undesirable substances in animal feedText with EEA relevance', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex I to Directive 2002/32/EC is hereby amended in accordance with the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

of 28 June 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 as regards the conditions for the payment of export refunds on cereal products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(11) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2299/2001(4), stipulates that, when a differentiated refund applies for a specific third country, entitlement to the refund is acquired on importation into that third country. Articles 14, 15 and 16 of that Regulation lay down the conditions for the payment of the refund when a differentiated refund applies and in particular the documents to be presented to prove the arrival of the product at destination.
(2) When a differentiated refund applies, Article 18(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 stipulates that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest refund rate, is paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territory of the Community.
(3) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 on the granting of export refunds on cereals and the measures to be taken in the event of disturbance on the market for cereals(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 602/2001(6), provides for exceptions to Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 as a result of a trade agreement concluded in 2000 on the abolition of refunds on common wheat, flour and bran exported to Poland.
(4) Trade agreements have recently been concluded between the European Community and Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (the Baltic States) establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and the total liberalisation of trade in other agricultural products. In the cereals sector, one of these concessions is the abolition of refunds on most of the products referred to in Article 1(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92.
(5) Article 7a of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 of 23 May 1995 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1006/2002(8), provides for special arrangements for exports to Poland and the Baltic States.
(6) Account must therefore be taken of those special arrangements, which are due to enter into force on 1 July 2002, so as not to impose unnecessary costs on exporters trading with the third countries concerned. To that end, in determining the lowest rate of refund, no account should be taken of the fact that no refund has been fixed for the destination concerned.
(7) The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1501/95 containing the exceptions to Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 should therefore be adapted to take account of the new trade agreements concluded with the Baltic States.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 6(2)(a) of Directive 64/432/EEC, bovine animals intended for intra-Community trade must come from a holding officially free of bovine tuberculosis and in addition in the case of animals more than six weeks old, be tested with negative reaction within 30 days of dispatch by use of an intradermal tuberculin test carried out in accordance with the provisions in Annex B point 32(d).
(2) The test referred to above is not required where the animals originate in a Member State or part of a Member State recognised as officially tuberculosis free or in a Member State or part of a Member State with an approved surveillance network.
(3) Certain Member States are not officially free from bovine tuberculosis and have not yet accomplished the installation of a surveillance network. However, pursuant to Council Directive 71/285/EEC(3) they had established a system of tuberculin testing carried out by authorised veterinary surgeons outside the herd of origin both at approved dealers premises and assembly centres, during the 30 days prior to dispatch to other Member States.

Whereas Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that derived intervention prices for white sugar are to be fixed for each of the deficit areas; whereas, for such fixing, it is appropriate that account  be taken of the regional variations which, given a normal harvest and free movement of sugar, might be expected to occur in the price of sugar under natural conditions of price formation on the market; Whereas a deficit supply situation is to be  foreseen in the areas of production in Italy, Ireland and the United Kingdom; Whereas Article 3 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that an intervention price for raw sugar shall be fixed; whereas such price should be established on the basis of  the intervention price for white sugar; Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1912/87 fixed the basic price for beet at 40,89 ECU per tonne; whereas Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the minimum price to be fixed for A beet shall be 98 %  of the basic price of the beet; Whereas Article 28 (3) and (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that losses resulting from undertakings to export surpluses of Community sugar are to be covered by production levies charged on the quantities of A  and B sugar and of A and B isoglucose produced within certain ceiling limits; whereas the third subparagraph of Article 28 (5) of that Regulation permits, as from the 1986/87 marketing year, a revision of the application of a ceiling to the B levy up to  a limit of 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar; Whereas, for the 1987/88 marketing year, the levy amount to be collected will not be sufficient, according to estimates, to entirely cover the overall loss due to these undertakings; Whereas  it is therefore necessary to increase, for the 1987/88 marketing year, the maximum amount for the B levy to 37,5 % of the intervention price for white sugar and to fix as a consequence the minimum price for B beet at 60,5 % of the basic price for beet;  Whereas Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that the threshold price for white sugar shall be equal to the target price, plus costs, calculated at a flat rate, of transport from the Community area having the largest surplus to the  most distant deficit consumption area in the Community, plus a flat-rate amount which takes into account the storage levy; whereas, given the state of supplies within the Community, account should be taken of transport charges between the departments of  northern France and Palermo; Whereas the threshold price for raw sugar is to be derived from the threshold price for white sugar by reference to a processing margin and a standard yield;

Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 97/830/EC(2), as last amended by Decision 2000/238/EC(3), imposes special conditions on the import of pistachios and certain products derived from pistachios originating in or consigned from Iran.
(2) Decision 97/830/EC provides that the competent authority shall ensure that before release onto the market from the point of entry into the Community, each consignment of products covered by that Decision is subject to systematic sampling and analysis for aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin. The term ""systematic sampling and analysis"" set out in Decision 97/830/EC may be subject to different interpretations and it is appropriate to clarify the meaning of such terms.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(4), established the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF).
(4) In the interests of public health, Member States should provide the Commission with periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of pistachios and certain products derived from pistachios originating in or consigned from Iran. Such reports should be in addition to the notification obligations under the rapid alert system for food and feed.
(5) It is important to ensure that the sampling and analysis of consignments of pistachios and products derived from pistachios originating in or consigned from Iran are performed in a harmonised manner throughout the Community.
(6) At the request of some Member States it is appropriate to update the list of points of entry through which the products covered by Decision 97/830/EC may be imported into the Community. For the sake of clarity that list should be replaced.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 of 12 February 1990 on the monitoring carried out at the time of export of agricultural products receiving refunds or other amounts (2), and in particular Article 6 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 2331/97 of 25 November 1997 on special conditions for granting export refunds on certain pigmeat products (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (5) provides that no refund is to be granted where the products are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the date on which the export declaration is accepted.
(3) Such requirements have nevertheless proved insufficient to ensure that uniform conditions apply when refunds are paid on some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(q) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.
(4) Additional conditions relating to products of average quality and enabling the payment of refunds on products of inferior quality to be refused should consequently be laid down at Community level.
(5) Provision should be made for an additional quality in the case of products falling within CN codes 1601 00 99 and 1602 49 19, not containing poultrymeat and for which the quality criteria should be set high in order to limit any refunds granted to such products where the quantities covered by export licence applications exceed or are likely to exceed traditional quantities.
(6) It is essential to make provision for checks to ensure compliance with this Regulation. Such checks are to be conducted pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 2090/2002 of 26 November 2002 laying down detailed rules for applying Council Regulation (EEC) No 386/90 as regards physical checks carried out when agricultural products qualifying for refunds are exported (6), and must in particular include an organoleptic examination and physical and chemical analyses. Applications for refunds must accordingly be accompanied by a written declaration to the effect that the products in question meet the requirements laid down herein.

of 18 February 2002
amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), and in particular Article 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(2), and in particular Article 19(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) Definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties were imposed on farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway by Regulations (EC) No 1890/97(3) and (EC) No 1891/97(4). The form of the duties set out in these two Regulations was, however, later reviewed, with both Regulations being replaced by Regulation (EC) No 772/1999(5).
(2) At the same time as definitive duties were imposed, individual price undertakings were also accepted from 190 Norwegian exporters by Commission Decision 97/634/EC(6). By offering undertakings, the companies all agreed to respect certain minimum import prices for their sales of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway and to provide the Commission, within due deadlines, periodic reports of their sales to the Community.
(3) However, due to the late receipt by the Commission of one such sales report from the Norwegian exporter Gje-Vi AS, a breach of the terms of the company's undertaking was deemed to have occurred. Acceptance of this company's undertaking was withdrawn by the Commission by Regulation (EC) No 651/98(7), with definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties imposed in its place by Council Regulation (EC) No 772/98(8).
B. REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(4) Gje-Vi AS (hereafter referred to as the ""Applicant""), subsequently made a satisfactory request for a partial interim review pursuant to Article 11(3) of Regulation (EC) No 384/96 and Article 19(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97.
(5) The request contained sufficient evidence of a significant change in circumstances which had occurred since the imposition of duties against its exports to the Community. The company therefore wished to offer again a price undertaking and submitted that, in view of these changes, such an undertaking would be both effective and practicable.
(6) A Notice of initiation of a partial interim review was published accordingly(9). It should be noted in this regard that the review was limited in scope to an examination of whether a new undertaking can be accepted from the Applicant.
C. REVIEW INVESTIGATION
1.1. Product concerned
(7) The product concerned is farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway currently classifiable within CN codes ex 0302 12 00 (TARIC codes 0302 12 00*21, 0302 12 00*22, 0302 12 00*23 and 0302 12 00*29 ), ex 0303 22 00 (TARIC codes 0303 22 00*21, 0302 22 00*22, 0303 22 00*23 and 0302 22 00*29 ), ex 0304 10 13 (TARIC codes 0304 10 13*21 and 0304 10 13*29 ) and ex 0304 20 13 (TARIC codes 0304 20 13*21 and 0304 20 13*29 ).
1.2. Parties concerned by the investigation
(8) The Applicant, the representative associations of producers in Norway and the Community, importers in the Community and the authorities in Norway were officially advised of the initiation of the review. All the parties directly concerned were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
(9) The Applicant was sent a questionnaire and submitted a reply within the time limits specified. A verification visit was subsequently carried out at its premises in Norway.
D. FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(10) The investigation showed that the Applicant has a different management structure and is now better organised than it was in 1998 when poor internal coordination and lack of personnel who were able to deal with the obligations imposed by the undertaking were the reason for the breach.
(11) The company's accounting staff are aware of the type and level of information that would be required for the quarterly sales reports as well as the need to submit the reports in due time, and there are no reasons for supposing that the same error would occur again.
(12) Furthermore, the company now has a good computerised accounting system which can accommodate the software necessary for the quarterly sales reports to the Commission.
(13) Importantly, also, the personnel who are now involved in selling the product concerned to the Community are aware that a strict system of minimum import prices applies and also know the price levels below which farmed Atlantic salmon cannot be sold. There are no indications or grounds for believing that the company would not observe the terms of the undertaking vis-Ă -vis the applicable minimum import prices.
(14) In view of the foregoing and the changed circumstances which have occurred since the imposition of definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties against the company, the offer of an undertaking from Gje-Vi AS is considered acceptable.
(15) In this regard, the undertaking has been formally accepted by Commission Decision 2002/157/EC(10).
E. CORRIGENDUM TO REGULATION (EC) No 1677/2001
(16) During publication of Regulation (EC) No 1677/2001(11), the name of the Norwegian company, Janas A/S (UT No 1/75, TARIC Additional Code 8177 ) was inadvertently omitted from the list of companies from which undertakings are accepted and thus exempted from the definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties.
(17) Accordingly, the name of this company should be inserted into the aforementioned list.
F. AMENDMENT OF THE ANNEX TO REGULATION (EC) No 772/1999
(18) In view of all the above, the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 should be amended accordingly,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 322/2002 of 18 February 2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 imposing definitive anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of farmed Atlantic salmon originating in Norway', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 shall be replaced by the text in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThe insertion of Janas A/S into the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 772/1999 shall apply with effect from 24 August 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 18 February 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

on the establishment of a warehouse for civilian crisis management missions
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 26, Article 42(4) and Article 43(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In December 2004, the Council approved the Civilian Headline Goal (CHG) 2008, in which it stated that the Union should be able to take the decision to launch a mission within 5 days of the approval of the Crisis Management Concept by the Council and that specific civilian capabilities of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) should be deployable within 30 days of the decision to launch the mission.
(2) Upon the approval of the CHG 2008, further political impetus to address civilian rapid deployment was provided by the Council’s adoption of the CHG 2010 in November 2007 and by its Declaration on strengthening capabilities, endorsed by the European Council in December 2008.
(3) To ensure rapid deployment capability in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, the establishment of a warehouse for civilian crisis management missions is needed. A study has confirmed the feasibility of warehousing as an effective tool for establishing the means of rapid deployment of physical assets required by civilian crisis management missions.
(4) In January 2010, a temporary solution for the storage of assets required for civilian crisis management missions was found by storing surplus equipment within the premises of the European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the moment, assets which allow 200 staff to deploy in a new mission are also stored within those premises. However, due to the temporary nature of this arrangement, a longer term solution needs to be found.
(5) In accordance with the chain of command in civilian crisis management missions, the Civilian Operation Commander, in cooperation with the Commission, needs to be able to ensure that the rapid deployment needs and operational requirements of the civilian crisis management missions are met.
(6) To that end, the Council emphasised in its Conclusions on ESDP of 17 November 2009 that a permanent capacity to store new and existing strategic material is a vital resource to ensure rapid deployment of equipment to new and existing missions, as well as ensuring sound financial management. Such a warehouse should be established through a procurement procedure resulting in a contract between the Commission and the warehouse operator. The Commission has prepared appropriate terms of reference for the procurement procedure, in cooperation with the European External Action Service (EEAS),","{'header': '14.11.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 314/25', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION 2012/698/CFSP\nof 13 November 2012\non the establishment of a warehouse for civilian crisis management missions', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In December 2004, the Council approved the Civilian Headline Goal (CHG) 2008, in which it stated that the Union should be able to take the decision to launch a mission within 5 days of the approval of the Crisis Management Concept by the Council and that specific civilian capabilities of the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) should be deployable within 30 days of the decision to launch the mission.\n\n((2)) Upon the approval of the CHG 2008, further political impetus to address civilian rapid deployment was provided by the Council’s adoption of the CHG 2010 in November 2007 and by its Declaration on strengthening capabilities, endorsed by the European Council in December 2008.\n\n((3)) To ensure rapid deployment capability in a sustainable and cost-efficient manner, the establishment of a warehouse for civilian crisis management missions is needed.

Supplying country New Zealand. Qualification for the quota is subject to conditions laid down in the relevant EU provisions"".\n\n2. The European Union shall also replace the definition of high quality beef in the European Union regulations implementing this quota by the following: ""Selected beef cuts derived from exclusively pasture grazed steers or heifers, the carcases of which have a dressed weight of not more than 370 kilograms. The carcases shall be classified as A, L, P, T or F, be trimmed to a fat depth of P or lower and have a muscling classification of 1 or 2 according to the carcase classification system administered by the New Zealand Meat Board"".\n\n3.

amending Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers for the purposes of adapting Annexes I and IV thereto to technical progress
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 relating to fertilisers (1), and in particular Article 31(1) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 provides that a fertiliser belonging to a type of fertiliser listed in Annex I thereto and complying with the conditions laid down in that Regulation may be designated EC fertiliser.
(2) The fertiliser types listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 include some types that may be sold only in the form of fine powders, and other types that may also be sold in the form of suspensions. Fertilisers in the form of suspensions pose less risk to the health of farmers when used in conditions under which the use of fine powders would result in the inhalation of dusts. To reduce the exposure of farmers to dusts, the option of using suspensions should be extended to include manganese micronutrient fertiliser types, and the range of ingredients permitted in existing boron and copper fertiliser suspensions should also be extended.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 foresees the use of complexing agents as ingredients in micro-nutrient fertilisers. However, no such fertilisers have been designated EC fertiliser because no list of authorised complexing agents has yet been established in Annex I to that Regulation and because there are no type designations for fertiliser containing complexing agents. Given that suitable complexing agents (lignosulfonic acid salts – hereinafter ‘LS’) are now available, they should be added to the list of authorised complexing agents and corresponding type designations should be created. Existing type designations for fertiliser solutions should also be adapted to allow the use of complexing agents, but each such solution should not contain more than one complexing agent to facilitate official controls.
(4) The new rules for micronutrient solutions and suspensions require relabelling of those fertiliser types. However, fertilisers labelled according to the old rules will remain in stock for some time. Manufacturers should therefore be allowed sufficient time to prepare new labels and to sell off all existing stocks.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 provides a set of rules for the labelling of mixed micro-nutrient fertilisers but does not provide for the corresponding type designations in its Annex I. Regulation (EU) No 137/2011 introduced Table E.2.4 in Section E.2 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 containing the corresponding type designations and clearer rules for mixtures of micro-nutrient fertilisers. However, Table E.2.4 requires some labelling information, which in certain cases would not be in conformity with that required by Articles 6(6) and 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. Table E.2.4 should therefore be amended accordingly. A transitional period should be granted to allow economic operators to adapt to the new rules and sell off their stocks of mixed micro-nutrient fertilisers.
(6) N,N’-di(2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N’-diacetic acid (hereinafter ‘HBED’) is an organic chelating agent for micro-nutrients. In particular, iron chelated with HBED is used to correct iron shortages and to remedy ferric chlorosis for a large variety of fruit trees. The elimination of ferric chlorosis and its symptoms ensures green foliage, good growth and development of the fruit. The iron chelated form of HBED has been authorised in Poland without any damage for the environment. HBED should therefore be added to the list of authorised organic chelating agents for micro-nutrients in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003. However, it is appropriate to provide for a transitional period so that HBED is authorised after the publication of the corresponding EN Standard.
(7) Dicyandiamide/1,2,4 triazole (hereinafter ‘DCD/TZ’) and 1,2,4 triazole/3-methylpyrazole (hereinafter ‘TZ/MP’) are nitrification inhibitors that are used in combination with fertilisers containing the nutrient nitrogen in the form of urea and/or ammonium salts. Those inhibitors prolong the availability of nitrogen to crops, reduce nitrate leaching, and reduce emissions of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere.
(8) N-(2-nitrophenyl)phosphoric triamide (hereinafter ‘2-NPT’) is a urease inhibitor designed for urea-containing nitrogen fertilisers to increase the availability of nitrogen to plants while reducing emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere.
(9) DCD/TZ, TZ/MP and 2-NPT have been used in Germany and DCD/TZ and TZ/MP in the Czech Republic for many years where they have been shown to be efficient and to pose no risk to the environment. DCD/TZ, TZ/MP and 2-NPT should therefore be added to the list of authorized nitrification and urease inhibitors in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 to make them more widely available to farmers throughout the Union.
(10) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 requires the control of EC fertilisers in accordance with the methods of sampling and analysis that are described in Annex IV thereto. However, some of those methods are not internationally recognised and should be replaced by EN standards recently developed by the European Committee for Standardisation.
(11) EN standards are usually validated by means of an inter-laboratory comparison to quantify the reproducibility and repeatability of the analytical methods. A distinction between validated EN Standards and non-validated methods should therefore be made to identify those EN Standards which have proven statistical reliability.
(12) To simplify legislation and facilitate future revision, it is appropriate to replace the full text of the analytical methods in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 with references to the EN standards published by the European Committee for Standardisation.
(13) Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established by Article 32 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003,","{'header': '15.3.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 75/12', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 223/2012\nof 14 March 2012\namending Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to fertilisers for the purposes of adapting Annexes I and IV thereto to technical progress\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 provides that a fertiliser belonging to a type of fertiliser listed in Annex I thereto and complying with the conditions laid down in that Regulation may be designated EC fertiliser.\n\n((2)) The fertiliser types listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 include some types that may be sold only in the form of fine powders, and other types that may also be sold in the form of suspensions.

(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

Having regard to Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils(1), and in particular Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) The Netherlands has requested authorisation to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to low-sulphur (50 ppm) petrol from 1 October 2002.
(2) The other Member States have been informed of this request by the Netherlands authorities.
(3) The differentiation of excise duty proposed by the Netherlands authorities, worth EUR 0,0136 per litre, must be available to all users of low-sulphur petrol. This measure complies with the minimum rates of excise duty referred to in Articles 3 and 4 of Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils(2).
(4) The derogation is sought on environmental grounds in particular the benefits in terms of air quality are known.
(5) Low-sulphur petrol complies with the environmental criterion (50 ppm) laid down in Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels and amending Council Directive 93/12/EEC(3). Under Article 3 of that Directive, the use of 50 ppm diesel will normally be compulsory from 1 January 2005. The derogation should therefore expire on 31 December 2004, subject to the application of Article 8(5) of Directive 92/81/EEC.
(6) On the information available at present, neither the Commission nor the Member States consider that the application of a differentiated rate of excise duty on low-sulphur fuel will cause distortions of competition affecting the common interest or hinder the operation of the single market.
(7) The Commission periodically reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or the operation of the internal market and are not incompatible with Community environmental policy,","{'title': '2002/263/EC: Council Decision of 25 March 2002 authorising the Netherlands to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to low-sulphur petrol in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Netherlands is hereby authorised to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to low-sulphur (50 ppm) petrol from 1 October 2002 to 31 December 2004.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe reduction in excise duty referred to in Article 1 not exceeding EUR 0,0136 per litre of fuel, must comply with the terms of Directive 92/82/EEC, and in particular the minimum rates laid down in Articles 3 and 4 thereof.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis authorisation shall expire on 31 December 2004.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Netherlands.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 March 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1860/2002 of 17 October 2002 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, undenatured and exported in the natural state, are hereby fixed to the amounts shown in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 18 October 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 17 October 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 104, 20.4.2002, p. 26.\n\n(3) OJ L 214, 8.9.1995, p. 16.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 17 October 2002 fixing the export refunds on white sugar and raw sugar exported in its unaltered state\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2020/2001 (OJ L 273, 16.10.2001, p. 6).'}]}"

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive in order to simplify the procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas, by letter to the Commission registered on 6 December 1996, the Portuguese Republic requested authorization to introduce a measure derogating from Article 9 of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 20 December 1996 of the request made by the Portuguese Republic;
Whereas the measure is necessary to counter the tax avoidance effects that have led a growing number of Community taxable and non-taxable persons to purchase telecommunications services outside the Community in order to avoid payment of VAT; whereas the measure is furthermore necessary to discourage suppliers of telecommunications services established in a Member State from establishing themselves outside the Community;
Whereas the measure is also necessary to simplify the procedure for charging the tax insofar as it provides the same tax obligations for customers of telecommunications services regardless of whether these services are performed by suppliers established inside or outside the Community;
Whereas the derogations will not affect, except to a negligible extent, the amount of tax due at the final consumption stage and will not therefore have an adverse effect on the European Communities' own resources arising from value-added tax;
Whereas it is necessary to grant this measure from 1 January 1997 in order to remedy as quickly as possible a situation undermining the competitiveness of European telecommunications companies; whereas from 1 January 1997 the customers and the suppliers of telecommunications services had no longer a legitimate confidence in the continuation of the legislation in force at that date;
Whereas it is desirable that the derogation should be granted until 31 December 1999, or, if a Directive altering the place of taxation of telecommunications services enters into force at an earlier date, until that date, in order to allow the Council to adopt a general Community solution based on the Commission proposal,","{'title': '97/211/EC: Council Decision of 17 March 1997 authorizing the Portuguese Republic to apply a measure derogating from Article 9 of the Sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Article 9 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Portuguese Republic is authorized to include, within Article 9 (2) (e) of the Directive, telecommunications services.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular Article 26 (3) thereof,
Whereas Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 provides that C sugar which is not carried forward to the following marketing year pursuant to Article 27 of the said Regulation and C isoglucose must be exported in the natural state without refunds or levies before 1 January following the end of the marketing year in question ; whereas, if part or all of these quantities are disposed of on the internal market or if they are not exported before the date laid down, a charge is to be levied, in respect of the quantities in question, which is to be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 41 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 ; whereas the detailed rules governing this matter were adopted in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2645/70 of 28 December 1970 on the provisions applicable to sugar produced in excess of the maximum quota (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1367/78 (3), and in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1700/80 of 30 June 1980 laying down detailed rules for the application of quotas for the production of isoglucose during the period 1 July 1980 to 30 June 1981 (4) ; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2645/70 has already been amended several times and whereas further amendments are necessary in view of the basic provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 concerning sugar and isoglucose, which are both sweeteners and in which there is a single market ; whereas therefore, for reasons of clarity, a new Regulation should be adopted incorporating the detailed rules concerning C sugar and C isoglucose;
Whereas for administrative reasons it must be specified that, for the purposes of Article 26 of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81, the quantity of C sugar or C isoglucose in respect of which proof of export within the prescribed period has not been furnished by the manufacturer before a final date is to be considered as having been disposed of on the internal market ; whereas for the same reasons the documents to be used to furnish this proof should be those used for export as required by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2630/81 of 10 September 1981 laying down special detailed rules for application of the system of import and export licences in the sugar sector (5) and in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3183/80 of 3 December 1980 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2646/81 (7);
Whereas when the charge to be levied in cases of disposal on the internal market is fixed, it is essential to place C sugar or C isoglucose which has not been exported on a similar footing to sugar or isoglucose imported from non-member countries ; whereas for this purpose the charge should be fixed taking account both of the import levy for sugar or, for isoglucose, of the variable element referred to in Article 16 (6) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 at the highest rate applicable during a period comprising the marketing year during which the sugar or isoglucose in question was produced and the six months following that marketing year, and also of a flat rate amount fixed on the basis of the cost of disposing of sugar imported from non-member countries;
Whereas goods supplied to the destinations referred to in Article 5 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2730/79 of 29 November 1979 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (8), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2646/81, are not to be considered as exports;
Whereas a manufacturer should be allowed to export sugar or isoglucose which has not been produced by him ; whereas it is necessary to provide in that case for the payment of a flat-rate amount which may be considered in all cases as compensation for any advantage accruing from such a substitution;
Whereas it is necessary to provide for certain measures in cases where force majeure make it impossible to export C sugar and C isoglucose ; whereas it is justified to make these measures applicable (1) OJ No L 177, 1.7.1981, p. 4. (2) OJ No L 283, 29.12.1970, p. 48. (3) OJ No L 166, 23.6.1978, p. 24. (4) OJ No L 166, 1.7.1980, p. 90. (5) OJ No L 258, 11.9.1981, p. 16. (6) OJ No L 338, 13.12.1980, p. 1.

As of 2011, Roshan Money Exchange was one of the primary money service providers (or “hawalas”) used by Taliban officials in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.\nAhmed Shah has provided hawala services to Taliban leaders in Helmand Province for a number of years and, as of 2011, was a trusted Taliban money service provider. In early 2012, the Taliban ordered Ahmed Shah to transfer money to a number of hawalas in Lashkar Gah, Helmand Province, from which a senior Taliban commander would then allocate the funds.\nIn late 2011, Ahmed Shah consolidated hundreds of thousands of US dollars to pass to the Taliban Finance Commission and transferred hundreds of thousands of US dollars for the Taliban, including to senior Taliban commanders. Also in late 2011, Ahmed Shah received through his hawala branch in Quetta, Pakistan, a transfer on behalf of the Taliban, money from which was used to purchase fertilizer and IED components, including batteries and detonator cord. In mid-2011, Taliban finance commission head Gul Agha Ishakzai instructed Ahmed Shah to deposit several million US dollars into Roshan Money Exchange for the Taliban. Gul Agha explained that when a money transfer was required, he would inform Ahmed Shah of the Taliban recipient. Ahmed Shah would then provide the required funds through his hawala system. As of mid-2010, Ahmed Shah moved money between Pakistan and Afghanistan for Taliban commanders and for narcotics traffickers. In addition to his facilitation activities, Ahmed Shah also donated large but unspecified sums of money to the Taliban in 2011.'}]}"

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY\n27.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0Introduction\nThis Section deals with security aspects of industrial activities that are unique to negotiating and awarding contracts or grant agreements conferring tasks involving, entailing and/or containing EU classified information and to their performance by industrial or other entities, including the release of, or access to, EU classified information during the public procurement and call for proposals procedures (bidding period and pre-contract negotiations).\n27.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Definitions\nFor the purpose of these common minimum standards, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n“Classified contract”: any contract or grant agreement to supply products, execute works, render available buildings or provide services, the performance of which requires or involves access to or creation of EU classified information;\n(b)\n“Classified sub-contract”: a contract entered into by a contractor or a grant beneficiary with another contractor (i.e. the subcontractor) for the supply of products, execution of works, provision of buildings or services, the performance of which requires or involves access to or generation of EU classified information;\n(c)\n“Contractor”: an economic operator or legal entity possessing the legal capacity to undertake contracts or to be beneficiary of a grant;\n(d)\n“Designated Security Authority (DSA)”: an authority responsible to the National Security Authority (NSA) of an EU Member State which is responsible for communicating to industry or other entities the national policy in all matters of industrial security and for providing direction and assistance in its implementation. The function of DSA may be carried out by the NSA;\n(e)\n“Facility Security Clearance (FSC)”: an administrative determination by a NSA/DSA that, from the security viewpoint, a facility can afford adequate security protection to EU classified information of a specific security classification level and that its personnel who require access to EU classified information have been appropriately security cleared and briefed on the necessary security requirements for accessing and protecting EU classified information;\n(f)\n“Industrial or other entity”: a contractor or a subcontractor involved in supplying goods, executing works or providing services; this may involve industrial, commercial, service, scientific, research, educational or development entities;\n(g)\n“Industrial security”: the application of protective measures and procedures to prevent, detect and recover from the loss or compromise of EU classified information handled by a contractor or subcontractor in (pre)contract negotiations and classified contracts;\n(h)\n“National Security Authority (NSA)”: the Government Authority of an EU Member State with ultimate responsibility for the protection of EU classified information within that Member State;\n(i)\n“Overall level of security classification of a contract”: determination of the security classification of the whole contract or grant agreement, based on the classification of information and/or material that is to be, or may be, generated, released or accessed under any element of the overall contract or grant agreement. The overall level of security classification of a contract may not be lower than the highest classification of any of its elements, but may be higher because of the aggregation effect;\n(j)\n“Security Aspects Letter (SAL)”: a set of special contractual conditions, issued by the contracting authority, which forms an integral part of a classified contract involving access to or generation of EU classified information, and that identifies the security requirements or those elements of the classified contract requiring security protection;\n(k)\n“Security Classification Guide (SCG)”: a document which describes the elements of a programme, contract or grant agreement which are classified, specifying the applicable security classification levels. The SCG may be expanded throughout the life of the programme, contract or grant agreement, and the elements of information may be re-classified or downgraded. The SCG must be part of the SAL.\n27.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Organisation\n(a)\nThe Commission may confer by classified contract tasks involving, entailing and/or containing EU classified information on industrial or other entities registered in a Member State;\n(b)\nThe Commission shall ensure that all requirements deriving from these minimum standards are complied with when awarding classified contracts;\n(c)\nThe Commission shall involve the relevant NSA or NSAs in order to apply these minimum standards on industrial security. NSAs may refer these tasks to one or more DSAs;\n(d)\nThe ultimate responsibility for protecting EU classified information within industrial or other entities rests with the management of these entities;\n(e)\nWhenever a classified contract or subcontract falling within the scope of these minimum standards is awarded, the Commission and/or the NSA/DSA, as appropriate, will promptly notify the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the contractor or subcontractor is registered.\n27.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0Classified contracts and grant decisions\n(a)\nThe security classification of contracts or grant agreements must take account of the following principles:\n—\nthe Commission determines, as appropriate, those aspects of the classified contract which require protection and the consequent security classification; in so doing, it must take into account the original security classification assigned by the originator to information generated before awarding the classified contract,\n—\nthe overall level of classification of the contract may not be lower than the highest classification of any of its elements,\n—\nEU classified information generated under contractual activities is classified in agreement with the Security Classification Guide,\n—\nwhere appropriate, the Commission is responsible for changing the overall level of classification of the contract, or security classification of any of its elements, in consultation with its originator, and for informing all interested parties,\n—\nclassified information released to the contractor or subcontractor or generated under contractual activity must not be used for purposes other than those defined by the classified contract and must not be disclosed to third parties without the prior written consent of the originator;\n(b)\nThe Commission and NSAs/DSAs of the relevant Member States are responsible for ensuring that contractors and subcontractors awarded classified contracts which involve information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above take all appropriate measures for safeguarding such EU classified information released to or generated by them in the performance of the classified contract in accordance with national laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the security requirements may result in termination of the classified contract;\n(c)\nAll industrial or other entities participating in classified contracts which involve access to information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above must hold a national FSC. The FSC is granted by the NSA/DSA of the Member State to confirm that a facility can afford and guarantee adequate security protection of EU classified information to the appropriate classification level;\n(d)\nWhen a classified contract is awarded, a Facility Security Officer (FSO), appointed by the management of the contractor or subcontractor, shall be responsible for requesting a Personnel Security Clearance (PSC) for all persons employed in industrial or other entities registered in an EU Member State whose duties require access to information classified CONFIDENTIEL UE or above subject to a classified contract, to be granted by the NSA/DSA of that Member State in accordance with its national regulations;\n(e)\nClassified contracts must include the SAL as defined in 27.2.(j). The SAL must contain the SCG;\n(f)\nBefore initiating a negotiated procedure for a classified contract the Commission will contact the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the industrial or other entities concerned are registered in order to obtain confirmation that they hold a valid FSC appropriate to the level of security classification of the contract;\n(g)\nThe contracting authority must not place a classified contract with a preferred economic operator before having received the valid FSC certificate;\n(h)\nUnless required by Member State national laws and regulations, an FSC is not required for contracts involving information classified RESTREINT UE;\n(i)\nInvitations to tender in respect of classified contracts must contain a provision requiring that an economic operator who fails to submit a tender or who is not selected be required to return all documents within a specified period of time;\n(j)\nIt may be necessary for contractors to negotiate classified subcontracts with subcontractors at various levels. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that all subcontracting activities are undertaken in accordance with the common minimum standards contained in this Section. However, the contractor must not transmit EU classified information or material to a subcontractor without the prior written consent of the originator;\n(k)\nThe conditions under which a contractor may subcontract must be defined in the tender or call for proposals and in the classified contract. No subcontract may be awarded to entities registered in a non-EU Member State without the express written authorisation of the Commission;\n(l)\nThroughout the life of the classified contract, compliance with all its security provisions will be monitored by the Commission, in conjunction with the relevant DSA/NSA. Any security incidents shall be reported, in accordance with the provisions laid down in Part II, Section 24 of these Rules on Security. Any change to or withdrawal of an FSC shall immediately be communicated to the Commission and to any other NSA/DSA to which it has been notified;\n(m)\nWhen a classified contract or a classified subcontract is terminated, the Commission and/or the NSA/DSA, as appropriate, will promptly notify the NSA/DSA of the Member State in which the contractor or subcontractor is registered;\n(n)\nThe common minimum standards contained in this Section shall continue to be complied with, and the confidentiality of classified information shall be maintained by the contractors and subcontractors, after termination or conclusion of the classified contract or classified subcontract;\n(o)\nSpecific provisions for the disposal of classified information at the end of the classified contract will be laid down in the SAL or in other relevant provisions identifying security requirements;\n(p)\nThe obligations and conditions referred to in this Section apply\nmutatis mutandis\nto procedures where grants are awarded by decision and notably to the beneficiaries of such grants. The grant decision shall set out all obligations of the beneficiaries.\n27.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0Visits\nVisits by personnel of the Commission in the context of classified contracts to industrial or other entities in the Member States performing EU classified contracts must be arranged with the relevant NSA/DSA. Visits by employees of industrial or other entities within the framework of an EU classified contract must be arranged between the NSAs/DSAs concerned. However, the NSAs/DSAs involved in an EU classified contract may agree on a procedure whereby visits by employees of industrial or other entities can be arranged directly.\n27.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0Transmission and transportation of EU classified information\n(a)\nWith regard to the transmission of EU classified information, the provisions of Part II, Section 21 of these Rules on Security shall apply. In order to supplement such provisions, any existing procedures in force among Member States will apply;\n(b)\nThe international transportation of EU classified material relating to classified contracts will be in accordance with Member State's national procedures. The following principles will be applied when examining security arrangements for international transportation:\n—\nsecurity is assured at all stages during the transportation and under all circumstances, from the point of origin to the ultimate destination,\n—\nthe degree of protection accorded to a consignment is determined by the highest classification of material contained within it,\n—\nan FSC is obtained, where appropriate, for companies providing transportation. In such cases, personnel handling the consignment must be security cleared in compliance with the common minimum standards contained in this Section,\n—\njourneys are point to point to the extent possible, and are completed as quickly as circumstances permit,\n—\nwhenever possible, routes should be only through EU Member States. Routes through non-EU Member States should only be undertaken when authorised by the NSA/DSA of the States of both the consignor and the consignee,\n—\nprior to any movement of EU classified material, a Transportation Plan is made up by the consignor and approved by the NSAs/DSAs concerned.’""}]}"

Whereas third countries are not in a position to supply sufficient reproductive material of the relevant species which can afford the same guarantees as Community reproductive material and which conforms to the provisions of the abovementioned  Directives;
Whereas the Member States should therefore be authorized to permit, for a limited period, the marketing of reproductive material of the relevant species which satisfies less stringent requirements to cover the shortage of reproductive material  satisfying the requirements of Directive 66/404/EEC or 71/161/EEC;
Whereas, for genetic reasons, the reproductive material must be collected at places of origin within the natural range of the relevant species and the strictest possible guarantees should be given to ensure the identity of the material;
Whereas, furthermore, reproductive material should be marketed only if it is accompanied by a document bearing certain details of the reproductive material in question;
Whereas each of the Member States should furthermore be authorized to permit the marketing in its territory of seed and plants which satisfy less stringent requirements in respect of provenance, as laid down in Directive 66/404/EEC or seed which  satisfies less stringent requirements in respect of specific purity as laid down in Directive 71/161/EEC, if the marketing of such material has been authorized in the other Member States under this Decision;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 15,180 million of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4174/2 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 8 August 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Toscana; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the authorities of Italy has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/6 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of Italy;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been complied with,","{'title': '97/704/EC: Commission Decision of 7 May 1997 on the approval of the single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Toscana concerned by Objective 2 in Italy (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Toscana concerned by Objective 2 in Italy, covering the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe single programming document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional policies of Italy;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. development and reinforcement of the SME base,\n\n2. tourism and cultural goods,\n\n3. technological innovation,\n\n4. environment,\n\n5. redevelopment of the territory and of the port system,\n\n6. strengthening of human resources;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the single programming document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the provisions on financial implementation,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the single programming document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

of 15 April 2004

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third-country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third-country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(2), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(3), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(4) laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) With a view to enlargement on 1 May 2004 and to encourage the gradual alignment of prices in the new Member States on the Community level, all remaining refunds for exports to the new Member States should be abolished.
(10) The consolidation of the maximum quantities for export within the limits set in the WTO Agreement will be more binding on the accession of the new Member States. In order to ensure the satisfactory management and optimum use of the maximum quantities for export, steps should therefore be taken to reduce or abolish the refunds for certain destinations, in particular those located in or close to the geographical area of the Community where the level of prices for milk products no longer justify the present level of refund rates, despite the collection of import duty in some of those countries.
(11) The policy of some non-member countries is to prevent disturbance on the internal market by applying frontier measures. The refunds for certain milk products exported to those destinations should be differentiated in order to reduce the risk of such measures being applied.
(12) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

","COMMISSION  REGULATION (EEC) No 3074/89
of 11 October 1989
imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of welded tubes originating in Yugoslavia and Romania
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. PROCEDURE
(1) In February 1988 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the Liaison Committee of the European Community Steel Tube Industry on behalf of manufacturers representing the majority of the Community production of the products in question.
(2) The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of injury caused thereby which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
The Commission accordingly announced, by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communites (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping concerning imports into the Community of certain welded tubes of iron or non-alloy steel falling within CN codes 7306 30 51, 7306 30 59, ex 7306 30 71 and ex 7306 30 79.
(3) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters and importers known to the Commission to be concerned and the complainant and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
During the investigation, the Commission was informed that more Yugoslavian producers than previously known were involved in the case. The Commission additionally gave them the opportunity to make known their views.
Furthermore the exporters concerned asked for extensions for replying to the Commission's questionnaires.
Consequently, the Commission was forced to overdraw the set time limits.
(4) Most of the Community producers, some of the importers, a Yugoslavian producer/exporter and the Romanian exporter made known their views in writing. Some of them requested and were granted hearings.
(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of establishing the facts and carried out inspections at the premises of the following:
(a) EC producers:
- Mannesmannroehren-Werke AG, Duesseldorf, Germany,
- IBS (United Tube Mills), Athens, Greece,
- Dalmine SpA, Dalmine, Italy,
- Arbed SA, Luxembourg, Luxembourg;
(b) Non EC-producer/exporter:
- Zeljezara Sisak, Sisak, Yugoslavia;
(c) EC importers:
- Mannesmann Handel AG, Duesseldorf, Germany,
- Montan Handel Peter Richter & Co., Duesseldorf, Germany.
(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988.
B. DUMPING
(a) Normal value
(7) Yugoslavia
Normal value was established on the basis of the comparable prices actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for the like product on the Yugoslavian market.
Domestic sales considered for calculation of normal value were made to independent customers at a profit in substantial quantities. The weighted average of the prices of these sales were therefore considered to be representative of the Yugoslavian domestic market.
Due to the high inflation rate in Yugoslavia during the investigation period normal values were calculated month by month. The exchange rates used for calculation are the official Yugoslavian rates, published by the Yugoslavian administration.
(8) Romania
As Romania is a non-market economy country, the normal value had to be determined on the price at which the like product is sold for domestic consumption in a third country with a market economy. Under these circumstances it was considered appropriate and not unreasonable to establish the normal value for Romania on the basis of the prices at which the like product was sold on the Yugoslavian domestic market.
The Commission is satisfied that between Romania and Yugoslavia there are no significant differences in the production processes, the supplies of raw materials, the scale of production and the quality of the finished products. The Commission has further considered that cost of production and the price level in Yugoslavia are in a reasonable proportion. The Commission therefore concluded that it was not unreasonable to apply the normal value established for Yugoslavia also for the Romanian products.
The Romanian exporter did not object to this determination.
(b) Export prices
(9) Export prices for both Yugoslavia and Romania were established on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the like product sold for export to the Community.
(c) Comparison
(10) In comparing value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability, such as discounts, commissions, credit terms, transport and insurance, handling, packing and related costs.
(11) All comparisons were made at an ex-works level.
(d) Dumping margins
(12) The preliminary comparison of the above facts showed that imports had been dumped. The dumping margins were equal to the difference between normal value and the export price to the Community duly adjusted. The weighted average dumping margins, as percentage rate of the free at Community frontier prices, were provisionally established as follows:
- Yugoslavia: 40,6 %;
- Romania: 31,7 %.
C. INJURY
(13) Imports from Yugoslavia increased from 20 720 tonnes in 1986 to 45 560 tonnes in 1988 and from Romania from 7 230 tonnes in 1986 to 19 986 tonnes in 1988. Cumulated imports from Yugoslavia and Romania climbed from 27 950 tonnes in 1986 to 65 546 tonnes in 1988 corresponding to an increase of about 135 % over that period.
(14) The corresponding market share increased from 2,8 % in 1986 to 5,1 % in 1988 for Yugoslavia and from 1 % to 2,2 % for Romania in the same period. The cumulated market shares of the imports under consideration increased from 3,8 % in 1986 to 7,3 % in 1988. In the most affected Member States, the cumulated market shares reached 23,6 % in the Federal Republic of Germany and 15,1 % in Italy respectively during the first semester of 1988.
(15) The evidence available to the Commission also indicates that the prices at which the dumped imports from Yugoslavia and Romania were sold in the Community undercut the prices of Community producers during the investigation period significantly. The average prices of the Romanian and Yugoslavian products were 22,6 % and 18,6 % below the prices of comparable products of Community producers.
(16) The sharp increase of dumped imports of the products under consideration originating in Romania and Yugoslavia has significantly contributed to dampen the recovery of Community production. The moderate increase of Community production of 4,2 % between 1986 and 1988 is to be measured against a growth of Community consumption of 19,8 % over the same period.
(17) The inflow of dumped imports prevented Community producers to benefit adequately from the increasing demand. Instead of achieving a reasonable improvement of their capacity utilization from the already relatively low level in 1986, Community producers suffered from a further reduction of their utilization rate in 1987 and could reach in 1988 only in some cases a small improvement distinctly below the level in 1985.
(18) The low prices at which the dumped products were sold in the Community, undercutting Community producer's prices by between 18 % and 22 %, combined with a substantial increase in market share in a market for a standardized product in commercial qualities caused price suppression in the Community. Community producers were forced either to accept sales at a loss or to reduce their sales. The consequent impact was a decline of the market share of Community producers and increasing financial losses or a reduction of profits.
(19) The Commission has also considered whether injury might have been caused by other factors than the dumped imports. It was found that imports from other third countries than Romania and Yugoslavia also increased significantly in the period between 1986 and 1988. The analysis of this factor revealed that the majority of this increase stemmed from imports of the products under consideration originating in Turkey and Venezuela. The Commission has in the meantime received evidence that imports from Turkey and Venezuela are also being dumped and are causing injury to the Community industry. A corresponding complaint has been lodged by the Community industry and the Commission has initiated an anti-dumping proceeding concerning the imports of the products concerned originating in Turkey and Venezuela (1).
(20) However, because of the increase of the dumped imports from Yugoslavia and Romania and their significant price undercutting outlined under recital (13) to (18), the Commission has come to the conclusion that the imports from Romania and Yugoslavia taken in isolation are causing material injury to the Community industry regardless of the fact that imports from Turkey and Venezuela have probably also contributed to the deterioration of the situation of the Community industry.
D. COMMUNITY INTEREST
(21) Iron and steel tube production is an important basic industry in the Community closely linked upstream to the steel industry. It is the most important customer for the transformation of primary ECSC steel products. In 1988 about 15 % of total EEC raw steel production was absorbed by the manufacture of tubes.
Because of overcapacities the sector has gone through a severe restructuring process which is still going on. In 1988 the sector employed 74 500 people in the Community down from 123 500 in 1981. Regionally the plants are located in the vicinity of the steel producing centers which are already suffering from employment problems linked to the downturn in the steel industry.
(22) Downstream the sector is an important supplier of all branches of the manufacturing industry. The most important customer groups are mechanical engineering, vehicle building, construction, structural steel works and the energy sector. In order to be in a position of manufacturing the whole range of products at competitive costs the industry depends on a reasonable utilization rate of its equipment which is basically provided for by the production of standardized commercial quality tubes which are in direct competition with the dumped products imported from Romania and Yugoslavia and account for a major part of the revenue generated by the industry. In view of these facts it is considered in the Community's interest to maintain a viable and healthy steel tube manufacturing industry and to take action against unfair trade practices. In the opinion of the Commission such action in the form of provisional anti-dumping duties should eliminate the disturbing effects of the price undercutting by the imports from Romania and Yugoslavia which would contribute to more stable prices for welded steel tubes in the Community. It is considered that the secondary effects of the limited price increases for the imported products in respect of the output of the main downstream branches mentioned above will be insignificant. No submissions to the contrary were made by or on behalf of Community purchasers or processors of the welded steel tubes concerned.
E. PROVISIONAL DUTIES
(23) As a result of the preliminary findings on dumping and injury with regard to the imports from Romania and Yugoslavia under consideration and in order to prevent further injury being caused by these imports it is considered that the interests of the Community require the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duties.
(24) The provisional duties should be less than the dumping margins found but adequate to remove the injury. Under this condition and because it was established that price undercutting was the decisive factor of injury, the Commission considers sufficient a rate of duty ad valorem which eliminated the margins of the price undercutting found.
On this basis the Commission determined the provisional antidumping duties to be
18 % for weided steel tubes imported from Yugoslavia,
22 % for those imported from Romania,
calculated on the net price, free-at-Community-frontier, customs uncleared.
(25) A period should be fixed within which the parties concerned may make their views known and request a hearing,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3074/89 of 11 October 1989 imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of welded tubes originating in Yugoslavia and Romania', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1670/2006 lays down that the quantities of cereals eligible for the refund are to be the quantities placed under control and distilled, weighted by a coefficient to be fixed annually for each Member State concerned. The coefficient is to express the average ratio between the total quantities exported and the total quantities marketed of the spirit drink concerned, on the basis of the trend noted in those quantities during the number of years corresponding to the average ageing period of the spirit drink in question.
(2) According to the information provided by Ireland in respect of the period 1 January to 31 December 2011, the average ageing period for Irish whiskey in 2011 was five years.
(3) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 899/2011 of 7 September 2011 fixing the coefficients applicable to cereals exported in the form of Irish whiskey for the period 2011/12 (3) has exhausted its effects, as it concerns the coefficients applicable for the year 2011/2012. The coefficients for the period 1 October 2012 to 30 September 2013 should therefore be fixed accordingly.
(4) Article 10 of Protocol 3 to the Agreement on the European Economic Area excludes the grant of refunds in respect of exports to Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway. Moreover, the Union has concluded agreements abolishing export refunds with certain third countries.

of 12 April 2002
redistributing unused portions of the 2001 quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 520/94 of 7 March 1994 establishing a Community procedure for administering quantitative quotas(1), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 138/96(2), and in particular Article 2(5) and Articles 14 and 24 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 519/94 of 7 March 1994 on common rules for imports from certain third countries and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 1765/82, (EEC) No 1766/82 and (EEC) No 3420/83(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1138/98(4), introduced annual quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China listed in Annex II to that Regulation. The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 520/94 are applicable to those quotas.
(2) The Commission accordingly adopted Regulation (EC) No 738/94(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 983/96(6), laying down general rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. These provisions apply to the administration of the above quotas subject to the provisions of this Regulation.
(3) In accordance with Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94, the competent authorities of the Member States notified the Commission of the quantities of quotas assigned in 2001 and not used.
(4) The unused quantities could not be redistributed in time to be used before the end of the 2001 quota year.
(5) Examination of the data received for each of the products in question indicates that the quantities not used in the 2001 quota year should be redistributed in 2002, up to a limit of the amounts set out in Annex I to this Regulation.
(6) The different administrative methods provided for by Regulation (EC) No 520/94 have been analysed and it is considered that the method based on traditional trade flows should be adopted. Under this method quota tranches are divided into two portions, one of which is reserved for traditional importers and the other for other applicants.
(7) This has proved to be the best way of ensuring the continuity of business for the Community importers concerned and avoiding any disturbance of trade flows.
(8) Quantities redistributed under this Regulation should be divided using the same criteria as for the allocation of the 2001 quotas except as regard the determination of the reference period for traditional importers and the introduction of new criteria to prevent multiple applications by non-traditional importers.
(9) The reference period used for redistributing the portion of the unused quantities set aside for traditional importers in the previous Regulation on the administration of these quotas should not be updated. The year 2000 was characterised by certain distortions, in particular a more than twofold increase of applications from one Member State, which resulted in substantially reduced individual quota allocations to all non-traditional importers in all Member States. The years 1998 or 1999 are, thus, the most recent years representatives of the normal trend of trade flows in the products in question. Traditional importers must, therefore, prove that they have imported products originating in China and covered by the quotas in question in the years 1998 or 1999.
(10) It has been found that the unusual increase of applications lodged for the portion of the quota set aside for non-traditional importers is due to multiple licence applications from companies who do not effectively operate as separate importers, but which have been established as separate legal entities only for the purpose of being able to submit additional applications. Regulation (EC) No 520/94, in particular recital 5 and Article 5 thereof, requires the Commission to ensure fair access to quotas and that import licences be issued for economically significant quantities. To redistribute the non-traditional quota in line with these principles, the administrative procedures should be amended. The Commission considers it necessary that operators applying as non-traditional importers and falling under the definition of related persons within the meaning of Article 143 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93(7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 444/2002(8), may only submit a single licence application for each line of the quota set aside for non-traditional importers. In order to exclude speculative applications, the amount that any non-traditional importer may request should be restricted to a set volume.
(11) It is necessary to simplify the formalities to be fulfilled by traditional importers who already hold import licences issued when the 2002 Community quotas were allocated. The competent administrative authorities already possess the requisite evidence of either 1998 or 1999 imports for all traditional importers. The latter need therefore only enclose a copy of their previous licences with their new licence applications.
(12) Measures should be taken to provide the best conditions for the allocation of that portion of the quota reserved for non-traditional importers with a view to optimum use of quotas. To this end, it is appropriate to provide for that portion to be allocated in proportion to the quantities requested, on the basis of a simultaneous examination of import licence applications actually lodged, and grant access only to importers who can prove that they obtained and made use of at least 80 % of an import licence for the product in question during the 2001 quota year. The amount that any non-traditional importer may request should also be restricted to a set volume or value.
(13) For the purposes of quota allocation, a time limit must be set for the submission of licence applications by traditional and other importers.
(14) With a view to optimum use of quotas, licence applications for imports of footwear under quotas which refer to several CN codes must specify the quantities required for each code.
(15) The Member States must inform the Commission of the import licence applications received, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94. The information about traditional importers' previous imports must be expressed in the same units as the quota in question.
(16) In the light of the experience gained in the management of the quotas, in order to facilitate import administration formalities to economic operators and in view of the fact that unused quantities may not be carried over to the following year more than once, thus limiting the risk of excessive accumulation of imports, it is deemed appropriate, without prejudice to the results of a further analysis which may appear to be warranted in this respect in the future, to set the expiry date of the redistribution import licences as 31 December 2002.
(17) These measures are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for the administration of quotas set up under Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 520/94,","{'title': ""Commission Regulation (EC) No 637/2002 of 12 April 2002 redistributing unused portions of the 2001 quantitative quotas for certain products originating in the People's Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation lays down specific provisions for the redistribution in 2002 of portions of the quantitative quotas referred to in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 519/94 which were not used in the 2001 quota year.\n\nThe quantities not used in the 2001 quota year shall be redistributed up to the limit of the volumes or values set out in Annex I to this Regulation.\n\nRegulation (EC) No 738/94 shall apply subject to the specific provisions of this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/75/EC of 20 November 2000 laying down specific provisions for the control and eradication of bluetongue (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(c), Articles 11 and 12 and the third paragraph of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 (2) lays down rules for the control, monitoring, surveillance and restrictions on movements of animals, in relation to bluetongue, in and from the restricted zones.
(2) Article 8(1) of that Regulation provides that movements of animals, their semen, ova and embryos from a holding or semen collection or storage centre located in a restricted zone to another holding or semen collection or storage centre are to be exempted from the exit ban provided for in Directive 2000/75/EC, subject to the requirement that the animals, their semen, ova and embryos comply with certain conditions set out in that Article.
(3) Experience has shown that in a number of Member States the effectiveness of the measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 to ensure the protection of animals against attacks by vectors might be undermined by a combination of factors. Those factors include the vector species, climate conditions and the type of husbandry of the susceptible ruminants.
(4) Therefore, as a transitional measure, Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 as amended by Regulation (EC) No 394/2008 (3) provides that, until 31 December 2008, Member States of destination may require that the movement of certain animals which are covered by the exemption provided for in Article 8(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 be subjected to additional conditions, on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account the entomological and epidemiological conditions in which animals are being introduced.
(5) In the period following the adoption of that transitional measure, experience has shown that in a number of Member States the application of the measures to ensure the protection of animals against attacks by vectors is not effective. In addition, the European Food Safety Authority states, in its Opinion on bluetongue of 19 June 2008 (4), that no treatment protocols have been formally approved in the Community for effectively protecting animals against Culicoides attacks.
(6) In view of those circumstances and pending further scientific assessment, it is appropriate to extend the period of application of the transitional measure laid down in Article 9a of Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1266/2007 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(1) Articles 13 and following of Title II of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 lay down the procedure for preparing and implementing single programming documents.
(2) Article 15(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 provides that, after consultation with the partners referred to in Article 8 of the Regulation, the Member State may submit to the Commission a development plan which is treated as a draft single programming document, and which contains the information referred to in Article 16 of the Regulation.
(3) Under Article 15(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999, on the basis of the regional development plan submitted by the Member State and within the partnership established in accordance with Article 8 of that Regulation, the Commission is to take a decision on the single programming document, in agreement with the Member State concerned and in accordance with the procedures laid down in Articles 48 to 51.
(4) The Flemish Government submitted to the Commission on 31 May 2000 an acceptable draft Single Programming Document for the regions in the province of East Flanders fulfilling the conditions for Objective 2 pursuant to Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 and the regions in that province qualifying for transitional support under Objective 5(b) pursuant to Article 6(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999. The draft contains the information listed in Article 16 of the Regulation, and in particular a description of the priorities selected and an indication of the financial contribution from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
(5) The date of submission of the draft which was considered acceptable by the Commission constitutes the date from which expenditure under the plan is eligible. Under Article 30 of the Regulation, it is necessary to lay down the final date for the eligibility of expenditure.

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 527/96 of 25 March 1996 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties and progressively introducing the Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 6 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 of 26 June 1991 on the application of the provisions of Community law to the Canary Islands (1) provides for the Common Customs Tariff (CCT) to be progressively introduced in the course of a transitional period which shall not extend beyond 31 December 2000; whereas, in accordance with Article 7 of that Regulation, the common commercial policy shall apply to the Canary Islands, without prejudice to the specific measures referred to in Article 6 (3) thereof;
Whereas paragraph 7.2 of the Annex to Council Decision 91/314/EEC of 26 June 1991 setting up a programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of the Canary Islands (Poseican) (2) states that specific tariff measures must continue to be considered and that in principle they must be limited to the transitional period provided for under Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 for the gradual adoption of the CCT to the Canary Islands;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 of 15 June 1992 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands (3) suspended in full until 31 December 1995 CCT duties applicable to imports into the Canary Islands of the products listed in the Annex to the Regulation which are intended for the Canary Islands' domestic market;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1605/95, the Commission has examined this year the effect of measures adopted in favour of the economy of the Canary Islands; whereas that examination has shown that the suspension of duties on certain industrial products has not had the effect of increasing the volume of imports originating in non-Community countries;
Whereas the progressive introduction of the suspended CCT duties will not in principle have any adverse effect on the sectors concerned by the duty suspensions or, in general, on the Canary Islands' economy as a whole; whereas an appropriate timetable should be laid down for successive increases in the applicable rates of duty;
Whereas, in order to take advantage of the closing date of the transitional period laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 1911/91 and to take account of the request from the Spanish authorities, the duty suspensions under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 may be retained in 1996;
Whereas, in view of the foregoing, the progressive introduction of CCT duties must commence on 1 January 1997 until fully applicable on 31 December 2000; whereas, in the case of certain sensitive sectors of the Canary Islands' economy, in particular those processing imported raw materials into finished products and commerce, duties should be introduced in a flexible manner so as to prevent in the early years any adverse effect on production and employment in those sectors;
Whereas the Marrakesh Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, approved by the Community by Decision 94/800/EC (4) provides for bound tariff reductions to be implemented in five equal rate reductions (or 10 rate reductions for certain tariff headings); whereas that progressive reduction, which became operative in 1995, will culminate in a minimum, or even a zero, rate by the end of the period in question; whereas, consequently, duty suspensions should continue in respect of certain industrial products on which CCT duties resulting from the GATT agreements would reach a zero or minimum rate on 31 December 2000, the date on which the transitional period for the Canary Islands expires;
Whereas imports into the Canary Islands of certain goods originating in non-Community countries were non-existent or nearly so during the period in which CCT duty suspensions applied; whereas, consequently, there are no grounds for retaining those suspensions;
Whereas the measures taken under Regulation (EEC) No 1605/92 should be retained, on the one hand, in order to ensure that products on which the suspension of duty is extended and then progressively dismantled are intended solely for the Canary Islands' domestic market and, on the other hand, in order to permit the Commission to be regularly informed of the volume of the imports in question and, if necessary, to adopt provisions designed to prevent any speculative movement of deflection of trade,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 527/96 of 25 March 1996 temporarily suspending the autonomous Common Customs Tariff duties and progressively introducing the Common Customs Tariff duties on imports of certain industrial products into the Canary Islands', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in September 2008 the Netherlands received an application from BASF SE for the inclusion of the active substance ametoctradin (initially applied for under the development code BAS 650 F) in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2009/535/EC (3) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(3) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in May 2008 France received an application from ISK Biosciences Europe SA for the inclusion of the active substance disodium phosphonate in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Commission Decision 2008/953/EC (4) confirmed that the dossier was complete and could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annex II and Annex III to that Directive.
(4) Confirmation of the completeness of the dossiers was necessary in order to allow them to be examined in detail and to allow Member States the possibility of granting provisional authorisations, for periods of up to three years, for plant protection products containing the active substances concerned, while complying with the conditions laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 91/414/EEC and, in particular, the conditions relating to the detailed assessment of the active substances and the plant protection products in the light of the requirements laid down by that Directive.
(5) For these active substances, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicants. The rapporteur Member States submitted the draft assessment reports to the Commission on 15 September 2009 (ametoctradin) and on 27 August 2009 (disodium phosphonate), respectively.
(6) Following submission of the draft assessment reports by the rapporteur Member States, it has been found to be necessary to request further information from the applicants and to have the rapporteur Member States examine that information and submit their assessment. Therefore, the examination of the dossiers is still ongoing and it will not be possible to complete the evaluation within the timeframe provided for in Directive 91/414/EEC.

It is expected that the evaluation and decision-making process with respect to a decision on a possible approval in accordance with Article 13(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 for ametoctradin and disodium phosphonate will have been completed within 24 months.

Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3077/78 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2238/91 (4), recognizes the equivalence with Community certificates of attestations accompanying hops imported from certain non-member countries and lists the  organizations in those countries authorized to issue equivalence attestations as well as the products covered; whereas subsequent political events have made it necessary to revise that list; whereas it is the responsibility of the organizations  concerned in those non-member countries to keep up to date the information contained in the Annex to this Regulation and to maintain close cooperation with the Commission by communicating to its departments the information concerned;
Whereas Hungary has subsequently undertaken to comply with the requirements stipulated in respect of the marketing of hops and hop products and has authorized an organization to issue equivalence attestations; whereas such attestations should therefore  be recognized as equivalent to Community certificates and the products which they cover be released for free circulation; whereas the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 3077/78 should be amended accordingly;

REGULATION (EU) No 1210/2010 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
of 15 December 2010
concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (1),
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1338/2001 of 28 June 2001 laying down measures necessary for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (3) requires credit institutions and, within the limits of their payment activity, other payment service providers and any other institutions engaged in the processing and distribution to the public of notes and coins to ensure that euro notes and coins which they have received and which they intend to put back into circulation are checked for authenticity and that counterfeits are detected.
(2) Commission Recommendation 2005/504/EC of 27 May 2005 concerning authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation (4) provides for recommended practices regarding the authentication of euro coins and the handling of euro coins unfit for circulation. However, the lack of a mandatory common framework for coin authentication results in different practices among Member States and cannot, therefore, ensure uniform protection of the currency throughout the euro area.
(3) To achieve effective and uniform authentication of euro coins throughout the euro area it is therefore necessary to introduce binding rules for the implementation of common procedures for the authentication of euro coins in circulation and for the implementation of control mechanisms of those procedures by the national authorities.
(4) During the authentication process, genuine euro coins that are unfit for circulation should also be identified. The circulation of unfit coins makes them more difficult to use, particularly in coin-operated machines, and may create confusion for the users as to the authenticity of those coins. Unfit coins should be removed from circulation. Common binding rules for Member States are therefore necessary for handling and reimbursing euro coins unfit for circulation.
(5) To coordinate the implementation of the authentication procedures, the details of testing and training requirements for coin authentication, the specifications for checking euro coins unfit for circulation and other practical implementation provisions should be further determined by the European Technical and Scientific Centre (ETSC) established by Commission Decision 2005/37/EC (5), after having consulted the counterfeit coin experts group referred to in that Decision.
(6) To allow for a gradual adjustment of their current system of rules and practices to the provisions of this Regulation, the Member States should, during a transitional period until 31 December 2014, be able to provide for derogations regarding the types of coin-processing machines to be used for the authentication of euro coins and for the number of those machines to be checked annually.
(7) Each national authority handling euro coins unfit for circulation should be able to apply a handling fee in accordance with this Regulation in order to meet the expenses related to the process. Handling fees should not be applied to the submissions of small quantities of euro coins unfit for circulation. Member States should be able to provide for exemptions from handling fees for persons which cooperate closely with the authorities in removing counterfeit or unfit coins from circulation. Member States should be able to accept bags or boxes of mixed counterfeit and unfit coins without applying a surcharge if this serves public interest.
(8) It should be for each Member State to introduce applicable penalties for infringements, with a view to achieving equivalent authentication of euro coins and handling of euro coins unfit for circulation throughout the euro area.
(9) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely effective and uniform authentication of euro coins throughout the euro area, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States due to the differences in national practices and can therefore be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union.

Whereas additional quotas to those indicated in Annex V to Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 may be  opened when required under special circumstances; that the Commission has received a request to  open additional quotas in view of trade fairs to be held in 1995;
Whereas additional quotas have already been opened for trade fairs in previous years for certain  third countries;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods (1), and in particular Article 1(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 specific generic descriptors (denominations) which have traditionally been used to indicate a particularity of a class of foods or beverages which could imply an effect on health may be exempted from the application of that Regulation following an application by the food business operators concerned.
(2) In order to ensure that applications on generic descriptors are dealt with transparently and within a reasonable time, Article 1(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 requires the Commission to adopt and make public the rules according to which such applications shall be made.
(3) The rules should ensure that the application is compiled in a way which presents and provides all the necessary information for the assessment of the application. Furthermore they should not prevent the Commission from requiring supplementary information, where appropriate and depending on the nature of the generic descriptor and the extent of the derogation applied for.
(4) It is appropriate to allow trade associations representing specific food sectors to submit applications on behalf of their members, in order to avoid multiple applications in respect of the same generic descriptor (denomination).
(5) In order, inter alia, to ensure a high level of protection for consumers, the use of claims should not be false, ambiguous or misleading. The same principle should apply for the use of generic descriptors (denominations) which could imply an effect on health. In order to achieve such objective and in line with the principle of proportionality, national authorities will have to exercise their own faculty of judgment, having regard to the case-law of the Court of Justice, to determine the typical reaction of the average consumer in a given case.
(6) Generic descriptors (denominations) should correspond to a period of at least 20 years proven usage within the Member State(s) prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation.

Whereas artichokes are produced in such quantities in the Community that reference prices should be fixed for them;
Whereas artichokes harvested during a given crop year are marketed from October to September of the following year; whereas the quantities harvested in the months July to October are so small that there is no need to fix reference prices for these  months; whereas reference prices should be fixed only for the period 1 November up to and including 30 June of the following year;
Whereas Article 23 (2) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 stipulates that reference prices are to be fixed at the same level as for the preceding marketing year, adjusted, after deducting the standard cost of transporting Community products between  production areas and Community consumption centres in the preceding year, by:

- the standard rate of transport costs in the current marketing year;
Whereas the resulting figure may nevertheless not exceed the arithmetic mean of producer prices in each Member State plus transport costs for the current year, after this amount has been increased by the rise in production costs less productivity  growth; whereas the reference price may, however, not be lower than in the preceding marketing year;
Whereas, to take seasonal price variations into account, the marketing year should be divided into several periods and a reference price fixed for each of these periods;
Whereas producer prices are to correspond to the average of the prices recorded on the representative market or markets situated in the production areas where prices are lowest, during the three years prior to the date on which the reference price is  fixed, for a home-grown product with defined commercial characteristics, being a product or variety representing a substantial proportion of the production marketed over the year or over part thereof and satisfying specified requirements as regards  market preparation; whereas, when the average of prices recorded on each representative market is being calculated, prices which could be considered excessively high or excessively low in relation to normal price fluctuations on that market are to be  disregarded;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(1), as last amended by Commission Directive 2003/84/EC(2), and in particular Article 6(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2266/2000(4), establishes a list of active substances of plant protection products to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. That list includes paraquat.
(2) For paraquat, the effects on human health and the environment have been assessed in accordance with the provisions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 for a range of uses proposed by the notifier. Pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 933/94 of 27 April 1994 laying down the active substances of plant protection products and designating the rapporteur Member State for the implementation of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92(5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2230/95(6), the United Kingdom was designated as rapporteur Member State. The United Kingdom submitted the relevant assessment reports and recommendations to the Commission on 31 October 1996 in accordance with Article 7(1)(c) of Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92.
(3) This assessment report has been reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health. The review was finalised on 3 October 2003 in the format of the Commission review report for paraquat.
(4) The report on paraquat and further information were also submitted to the Scientific Committee for Plants. The Committee was asked to comment on the relevance for consumers and operators of the ocular and pulmonary changes, which were observed in the long-term rat study, on the risk for operators, taking into particular account potential inhalatory and dermal exposure, on potential long-term effects to soil-dwelling organisms, and on the risks the intended uses might pose to reproducing birds and hares. In its opinion(7), the Scientific Committee concluded that neither the pulmonary lesions observed in animals after oral administration of paraquat nor the systemic effects on the eye, observed in rats and not in other species, are relevant to the risk assessment for operators and consumers. Based on the field exposure studies, corroborated by information on health surveys on operators, the Committee found that when paraquat is used as a plant protection product as recommended under prescribed good working practices, its use does not pose any significant health risk for the operators. The Committee also noted that uses at recommended field rates are unlikely to pose a significant risk to soil-dwelling organisms. However, a more detailed appraisal of the likely effects of paraquat on the rate of degradation of organic material in soil was requested in view of remaining uncertainty. This information was subsequently delivered and evaluated by the rapporteur Member State. Furthermore, the Scientific Committee concluded that available studies indicate a hazard to ground-breeding birds but further information on realistic exposures is needed for a definitive assessment of the risk. This information was subsequently provided and the evaluation within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health concluded that there are several situations where exposure to ground-nesting birds is negligible. However, there are also scenarios where exposure may occur. The evaluation within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health concluded that the risk would be acceptable, provided appropriate risk-mitigation measures are applied. Finally, the Scientific Committee concluded that paraquat may be expected to cause lethal and sublethal effects for hares, but the available data are inadequate to estimate the proportion of hares affected. The views of the Scientific Committee were taken into consideration when drafting this Directive and the review report. The evaluation within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health concluded that the risk would be acceptable if appropriate risk-mitigation measures were applied.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that there are uses of plant protection products containing paraquat which may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC, provided appropriate risk-mitigation measures and restrictions are applied. It is therefore appropriate to include paraquat in Annex I, in order to ensure that in all Member States the authorisations of plant protection products containing this active substance can be granted in accordance with the provisions of that Directive. However some uses of plant protection products containing paraquat pose an unacceptable risk and should therefore not be authorised. Moreover, it is considered appropriate to ensure that Member States impose that the notifier and any other authorisation holder of paraquat establish a stewardship programme particularly for operator safety, and that they report to the Commission yearly on incidences of operator health problems as well as possible impacts on hares. This should enable a verification of whether the risk-mitigation measures imposed by Member States really limit the possible risks for operators and hares to an acceptable level, and, if appropriate, a re-evaluation, in line with scientific progress, of the properties and potentially related risks to humans and the environment.
(6) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is included in Annex I in order to permit Member States and the interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements which will result from the inclusion.
(7) After inclusion, Member States should be allowed a reasonable period within which to implement the provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC as regards plant protection products containing paraquat, and, in particular, to review existing authorisations to ensure that the conditions regarding those active substances set out in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are satisfied. A longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the complete dossier of each plant protection product in accordance with the uniform principles laid down in Directive 91/414/EEC.
(8) It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 91/414/EEC accordingly.
(9) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': 'Commission Directive 2003/112/EC of 1 December 2003 amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC to include paraquat as an active substance (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex I to Directive 91/414/EEC is amended as set out in the Annex to this Directive.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nMember States shall adopt and publish by 30 April 2005 at the latest the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive.

(2009/409/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(8) thereof,
Having regard to the Recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) Pursuant to point 5 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the obligation in Article 104(1) of the Treaty to avoid excessive general government deficits does not apply to the United Kingdom unless it moves to the third stage of economic and monetary union (1). While in the second stage of economic and monetary union, the United Kingdom is required to endeavour to avoid excessive deficits, pursuant to Article 116(4) of the Treaty.
(3) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation. The Stability and Growth Pact includes Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (2), which was adopted in order to further the prompt correction of excessive general government deficits.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of the public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that in particular the economic and budgetary background was taken fully into account in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) By Decision 2008/713/EC (3) the Council decided, in accordance with Article 104(6), that an excessive deficit existed in the United Kingdom.
(6) In accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, on 8 July 2008 the Council also, on the basis of a Commission recommendation, adopted a Recommendation (4) to the UK authorities calling on them to put an end to the excessive deficit situation as soon as possible and by financial year 2009/2010 at the latest, by bringing the general government deficit below 3 % of GDP in a credible and sustainable manner. To that end, the Council recommended the authorities to ensure a structural improvement of at least 0,5 % of GDP in 2009/10 and established the deadline of 8 January 2008 for the UK government to take effective action.
(7) The assessment of the action taken by the United Kingdom to correct the excessive deficit by 2009/2010 in response to the Council Recommendation under Article 104(7) leads to the following conclusions:
(a) subsequent to the Article 104(7) Council Recommendation in July 2008, the UK authorities announced additional deficit-increasing discretionary measures. On 16 July 2008 the government announced the postponement of the inflation-linked increase in fuel excise duty that was scheduled to take place in October 2008, at an estimated cost of 0,05 % of GDP in foregone revenues in 2008/09. Additional deficit-increasing measures, equivalent to 0,1 % of GDP in 2009/10, were introduced in September 2008, including through higher spending on housing;
(b) on 24 November 2008, the government presented its 2008 Pre-Budget Report (PBR). Due in major part to the unexpectedly strong negative fallout from the global financial crisis which unfolded from autumn 2007 onwards, the PBR presented a marked downward revision to the medium-term macroeconomic projections. Against this macroeconomic context, the government announced further discretionary fiscal loosening, aimed at supporting the economy, of around 1/2 % of GDP in 2008/09 and 1,0 % of GDP in 2009/10. The measures included a temporary reduction in the standard VAT rate, accounting for around half of the stimulus, and the frontloading of investment spending;
(c) overall, the stimulus measures were in line with those envisaged in the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) that was agreed by the European Council on 11 December 2008;
(d) the macroeconomic and fiscal projections in the 2008 update of the UK’s convergence programme, submitted to the Commission on 18 December 2008, were identical to those in the 2008 PBR and projected a further increase in the deficit ratio in 2009/10 to 8,2 % of GDP. The greater part of the projected deterioration in public finances in 2009/10 over the preceding year reflects two, partly-interconnected factors: first, the overall contraction in GDP; and secondly, the sharp losses in tax revenue from two hitherto major sources, the financial sector and the housing market. Nevertheless, around one-third of the forecast increase in the deficit in 2009/10 reflects the adopted fiscal stimulus measures;
(e) the 2008 convergence programme update also projects a government debt ratio in 2009/10 of around 60 % of GDP, sharply higher than the debt ratio of close to 46 % that was forecast by the UK authorities in March 2008;
(f) the Commission services January 2009 interim forecast projects a deficit in 2009/10 of 9 1/2 % of GDP, 1 1/4 pp. higher than in the convergence programme, primarily on account of the significantly worse macroeconomic economic context foreseen in the Commission services’ January 2009 forecast, with the level of nominal GDP about 5 % lower. Meanwhile, the public finances data that were published subsequent to the Commission services’ January 2009 interim forecast indicate that the out-turn for public finances in 2008/09 is likely to be worse than expected.
(8) This leads to the conclusion that, in a context of progressively weakening economic conditions, the UK authorities have since July 2008 implemented additional deficit-increasing discretionary measures in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP). The combined effects of the strong economic downturn and the stimulus measures adopted by the UK authorities have led to the substantial deterioration in the UK’s budgetary position projected for 2009/2010,","{'header': '29.5.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 132/11', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 27 April 2009\nestablishing, in accordance with Article 104(8) of the Treaty, whether effective action has been taken by the United Kingdom in response to the Council Recommendation of 8 July 2008 pursuant to Article 104(7)\n(2009/409/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty, Member States are to avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) Pursuant to point 5 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the obligation in Article 104(1) of the Treaty to avoid excessive general government deficits does not apply to the United Kingdom unless it moves to the third stage of economic and monetary union(1).

Meanwhile, the public finances data that were published subsequent to the Commission services’ January 2009 interim forecast indicate that the out-turn for public finances in 2008/09 is likely to be worse than expected.\n\n((a)) subsequent to the Article 104(7) Council Recommendation in July 2008, the UK authorities announced additional deficit-increasing discretionary measures. On 16\xa0July 2008 the government announced the postponement of the inflation-linked increase in fuel excise duty that was scheduled to take place in October 2008, at an estimated cost of 0,05\xa0% of GDP in foregone revenues in 2008/09. Additional deficit-increasing measures, equivalent to 0,1\xa0% of GDP in 2009/10, were introduced in September 2008, including through higher spending on housing;\n\n((b)) on 24 November 2008, the government presented its 2008 Pre-Budget Report (PBR). Due in major part to the unexpectedly strong negative fallout from the global financial crisis which unfolded from autumn 2007 onwards, the PBR presented a marked downward revision to the medium-term macroeconomic projections. Against this macroeconomic context, the government announced further discretionary fiscal loosening, aimed at supporting the economy, of around 1/2\xa0% of GDP in 2008/09 and 1,0\xa0% of GDP in 2009/10. The measures included a temporary reduction in the standard VAT rate, accounting for around half of the stimulus, and the frontloading of investment spending;\n\n((c)) overall, the stimulus measures were in line with those envisaged in the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) that was agreed by the European Council on 11\xa0December 2008;\n\n((d)) the macroeconomic and fiscal projections in the 2008 update of the UK’s convergence programme, submitted to the Commission on 18 December 2008, were identical to those in the 2008 PBR and projected a further increase in the deficit ratio in 2009/10 to 8,2\xa0% of GDP. The greater part of the projected deterioration in public finances in 2009/10 over the preceding year reflects two, partly-interconnected factors: first, the overall contraction in GDP; and secondly, the sharp losses in tax revenue from two hitherto major sources, the financial sector and the housing market. Nevertheless, around one-third of the forecast increase in the deficit in 2009/10 reflects the adopted fiscal stimulus measures;\n\n((e)) the 2008 convergence programme update also projects a government debt ratio in 2009/10 of around 60\xa0% of GDP, sharply higher than the debt ratio of close to 46\xa0% that was forecast by the UK authorities in March 2008;\n\n((f)) the Commission services January 2009 interim forecast projects a deficit in 2009/10 of 9 1/2\xa0% of GDP, 1 1/4 pp. higher than in the convergence programme, primarily on account of the significantly worse macroeconomic economic context foreseen in the Commission services’ January 2009 forecast, with the level of nominal GDP about 5\xa0% lower. Meanwhile, the public finances data that were published subsequent to the Commission services’ January 2009 interim forecast indicate that the out-turn for public finances in 2008/09 is likely to be worse than expected.\n\n((8)) This leads to the conclusion that, in a context of progressively weakening economic conditions, the UK authorities have since July 2008 implemented additional deficit-increasing discretionary measures in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP). The combined effects of the strong economic downturn and the stimulus measures adopted by the UK authorities have led to the substantial deterioration in the UK’s budgetary position projected for 2009/2010,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe United Kingdom has not taken action in response to the Council Recommendation of 8 July 2008 within the period laid down in that Recommendation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 (2) established a goods nomenclature (the ‘Combined Nomenclature’), and set out the conventional duty rates of the Common Customs Tariff.
(2) By its Decision 2012/792/EU of 6 December 2012 on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and Brazil pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions with respect to processed poultry meat provided for in the EU Schedule annexed to GATT 1994, and of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and Thailand pursuant to Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994 relating to the modification of concessions with respect to processed poultry meat provided for in the EU Schedule annexed to GATT 1994 (3) (‘the Agreements’), the Council approved the Agreements on behalf of the Union with a view to closing negotiations initiated pursuant to Article XXVIII of GATT 1994.
(3) The Agreements were negotiated on the basis of the Combined Nomenclature codes in force at the time.
(4) In the newest version of Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 as laid down in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1006/2011 (4), the tariff lines 16 023 940 and 16 023 980 have been merged into a new tariff line 16 023 985. The Annex to this Regulation reflects this new situation.
(5) The autonomous customs duty rates for the tariff lines covered by the negotiations are currently set at levels below the new conventional duty rates resulting from the modification of concessions pursuant to Article XXVIII of GATT 1994. However, under Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87, the autonomous customs duties apply when they are below the conventional duties.
(6) The autonomous rate of duty fixed in the Common Customs Tariff should therefore be increased to the level of the conventional duty.

,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 of 22 October 2007 establishing a common organisation of agricultural markets and on specific provisions for certain agricultural products (Single CMO Regulation) (1), and in particular Article 144(1) and Article 148 in conjunction with Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) As a result of the agreements reached in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) multilateral trade negotiations, the Commission has drawn up a ‘CXL-European Communities’ schedule (hereinafter the ‘CXL schedule’), listing the concessions granted. The schedule requires the Union to open certain annual tariff quotas for the products falling within CN codes 0714 10 91, ex 0714 10 98, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 originating in Indonesia, the People’s Republic of China (China), other contracting parties to the WTO excluding Thailand and certain third countries that are not members of the WTO. Under those quotas the customs duty is limited to 6 % ad valorem. The quotas are to be opened on a multiannual basis and administered by the Commission.
(2) The CXL schedule also requires the Union to open two duty-free tariff quotas for sweet potatoes falling within CN code 0714 20 90 in favour of China and other third countries respectively, as well as two tariff quotas for manioc starch falling within CN code 1108 14 00 in favour of other third countries.
(3) The agreement in the form of an exchange of letters on the consultations between the European Community and the Kingdom of Thailand under GATT Article XXIII (2) (hereinafter referred to as ‘the agreement with Thailand’), approved by Council Decision 96/317/EC of 13 May 1996 concerning the conclusion of the results of consultations with Thailand under GATT Article XXIII (3), provides for the opening of an additional autonomous annual tariff quota of 10 500 tonnes of manioc starch, 10 000 tonnes of which are reserved for Thailand. The applicable duty is the most favoured nation duty (MFN duty) in force, less EUR 100 per tonne.
(4) The detailed rules for the application of the management of all these import tariff quotas, hereinafter referred to as ‘the quotas’ are currently laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2402/96 of 17 December 1996 opening and setting administrative rules for certain annual tariff quotas for sweet potatoes and manioc starch (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 27/2008 of 15 January 2008 opening and providing for the administration of certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714 10 91, ex 0714 10 98, 0714 90 11 and 0714 90 19 originating in certain third countries other than Thailand (5).
(5) The use of the first come, first served principle has proved positive in other agricultural sectors, and in the interest of administrative simplification, those quotas should henceforth be administered in accordance with the method indicated in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (6).
(6) Having regard to the particularities involved in the transfer from one management system to another, Article 308c(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 should not apply to the tariff period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.
(7) In the case of sweet potatoes, it is important to differentiate those intended for human consumption from other products; the presentation and packaging of sweet potatoes falling within CN code 0714 20 10 (for human consumption) should therefore be specified and products not meeting those presentation and packaging specifications should be considered to fall within CN code 0714 20 90.
(8) It is necessary to maintain a system of administration which ensures that only products originating in Indonesia, China and Thailand can be imported under the quotas allocated to those countries. It should be clarified which kind of proof certifying the origin of products has to be provided to benefit from these tariff quotas under the first come, first served system.
(9) Regulations (EC) No 2402/96 and (EC) No 27/2008 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation. However, those Regulations should continue to apply to import licences issued for import quota periods prior to those covered by this Regulation.
(10) The provisions laid down in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1000/2010 of 3 November 2010 derogating from Regulations (EC) No 2402/96, (EC) No 2058/96, (EC) No 2305/2003, (EC) No 969/2006, (EC) No 1918/2006, (EC) No 1964/2006, (EC) No 27/2008, (EC) No 1067/2008 and (EC) No 828/2009 as regards the dates for lodging import licence applications and issuing import licences in 2011 under tariff quotas for sweet potatoes, manioc starch, manioc, cereals, rice, sugar and olive oil and derogating from Regulations (EC) No 382/2008, (EC) No 1518/2003, (EC) No 596/2004, (EC) No 633/2004 and (EC) No 951/2006 as regards the dates for issuing export licences in 2011 in the beef and veal, pigmeat, eggs, poultrymeat and out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose sectors (7) are no longer relevant, given the transfer of management of those quotas to the first come, first served system referred to in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.

The quotas are to be opened on a multiannual basis and administered by the Commission.\n\n((2)) The CXL schedule also requires the Union to open two duty-free tariff quotas for sweet potatoes falling within CN code 0714\xa020\xa090 in favour of China and other third countries respectively, as well as two tariff quotas for manioc starch falling within CN code 1108\xa014\xa000 in favour of other third countries.\n\n((3)) The agreement in the form of an exchange of letters on the consultations between the European Community and the Kingdom of Thailand under GATT Article XXIII(2)(hereinafter referred to as ‘the agreement with Thailand’), approved by Council Decision 96/317/EC of 13 May 1996 concerning the conclusion of the results of consultations with Thailand under GATT Article XXIII(3), provides for the opening of an additional autonomous annual tariff quota of 10\xa0500 tonnes of manioc starch, 10\xa0000 tonnes of which are reserved for Thailand. The applicable duty is the most favoured nation duty (MFN duty) in force, less EUR\xa0100 per tonne.\n\n((4)) The detailed rules for the application of the management of all these import tariff quotas, hereinafter referred to as ‘the quotas’ are currently laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2402/96 of 17 December 1996 opening and setting administrative rules for certain annual tariff quotas for sweet potatoes and manioc starch(4)and Commission Regulation (EC) No 27/2008 of 15 January 2008 opening and providing for the administration of certain annual tariff quotas for products covered by CN codes 0714\xa010\xa091, ex\xa00714\xa010\xa098, 0714\xa090\xa011 and 0714\xa090\xa019 originating in certain third countries other than Thailand(5).\n\n((5)) The use of the first come, first served principle has proved positive in other agricultural sectors, and in the interest of administrative simplification, those quotas should henceforth be administered in accordance with the method indicated in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. This should be done in accordance with Articles 308a, 308b and 308c(1) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code(6).\n\n((6)) Having regard to the particularities involved in the transfer from one management system to another, Article 308c(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 2454/93 should not apply to the tariff period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011.\n\n((7)) In the case of sweet potatoes, it is important to differentiate those intended for human consumption from other products; the presentation and packaging of sweet potatoes falling within CN code 0714\xa020\xa010 (for human consumption) should therefore be specified and products not meeting those presentation and packaging specifications should be considered to fall within CN code 0714\xa020\xa090.\n\n((8)) It is necessary to maintain a system of administration which ensures that only products originating in Indonesia, China and Thailand can be imported under the quotas allocated to those countries. It should be clarified which kind of proof certifying the origin of products has to be provided to benefit from these tariff quotas under the first come, first served system.\n\n((9)) Regulations (EC) No 2402/96 and (EC) No 27/2008 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation. However, those Regulations should continue to apply to import licences issued for import quota periods prior to those covered by this Regulation.\n\n((10)) The provisions laid down in Articles 1, 2 and 3 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1000/2010 of 3 November 2010 derogating from Regulations (EC) No 2402/96, (EC) No 2058/96, (EC) No 2305/2003, (EC) No 969/2006, (EC) No 1918/2006, (EC) No 1964/2006, (EC) No 27/2008, (EC) No 1067/2008 and (EC) No 828/2009 as regards the dates for lodging import licence applications and issuing import licences in 2011 under tariff quotas for sweet potatoes, manioc starch, manioc, cereals, rice, sugar and olive oil and derogating from Regulations (EC) No 382/2008, (EC) No 1518/2003, (EC) No 596/2004, (EC) No 633/2004 and (EC) No 951/2006 as regards the dates for issuing export licences in 2011 in the beef and veal, pigmeat, eggs, poultrymeat and out-of-quota sugar and isoglucose sectors(7)are no longer relevant, given the transfer of management of those quotas to the first come, first served system referred to in Article 144(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007. They should therefore be deleted.\n\n((11)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for the Common Organisation of Agricultural Markets,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThis Regulation opens the import tariff quotas set out in the Annex hereto.

Whereas, taking account of the important role that these bodies can play in ensuring that the production aid arrangements are applied correctly and in a uniform manner, provision should be made for a method of financing their actual expenditure which enables them to operate smoothly and efficiently within the framework of administrative autonomy provided for in the rules concerned; whereas that objective can be achieved via a method which combines Community financing and financing by the Member State;

(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted.

(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1553/89 of 29 May 1989 on the definitive uniform arrangements for the collection of own resources accuring from value added tax (1), and in particular Article 13 thereof,
Whereas, under Article 28 (3) of the Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (2), hereinafter called  'the Sixth Directive', the Member States may continue to exempt or tax certain transactions; whereas these transactions must be taken into account for the determination of the VAT own resources base;
Whereas with effect from 1 January 1990 the possibility afforded Member States of continuing to tax or exempt certain transactions listed in Annexes E and F to the Sixth Directive was terminated by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 1 (1) and  point 2 (a) of Directive 89/465/EEC (3); whereas, consequently, the authorizations granted in this connection by the Commission for the purposes of determining the VAT own resources base should also be discontinued;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2000/29/EC of 8 May 2000 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), and in particular the second indent of Article 15(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2000/29/EC provides for protective measures against the introduction into the Union from third countries of organisms that are harmful to plants or plant products.
(2) Bark-free sawn wood of Quercus L., Platanus L. and Acer saccharum Marsh. originating in the United States of America and covered by one of the CN codes and the descriptions set out in Section I(6) of Part B of Annex V to Directive 2000/29/EC may not be introduced into the Union unless accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate as provided for in Article 13(1)(ii) of that Directive.
(3) Directive 2000/29/EC allows for derogations from Article 13(1)(ii) in the case of wood, if equivalent safeguards are ensured by means of alternative documentation or marking.
(4) The Commission has noted on the basis of information supplied by the United States of America that an official programme, the Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Lumber Certification Program, has been approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, US Department of Agriculture and will be operated by the US National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA).
(5) The Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Lumber Certification Program ensures that approved hardwood facilities in the US operate under the Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Standard. That Standard ensures that all parts of sawn hardwood lumber exported under that Program are kiln dried to less than 20 % moisture by weight as per kiln drying schedules and are bark-free.
(6) That Standard also ensures that all kiln dried hardwood bundles are attached with an NHLA steel ID clip stamped with ‘NHLA — KD’ along with a unique number assigned to each bundle. Each number is listed on the corresponding Kiln Drying Hardwood Lumber Certificate (‘Certificate of Kiln Drying’).
(7) Member States should therefore be authorised to allow for bark-free sawn wood of Quercus L., Platanus L. and Acer saccharum Marsh. originating in the United States of America to be introduced into their territory when accompanied by a Certificate of Kiln Drying as an alternative to a phytosanitary certificate, provided that certain conditions are fulfilled.
(8) The Commission should ensure that the United States of America makes available all technical information necessary to assess the functioning of the Program. In addition, Member States should continually assess the use of the NHLA ID clips and associated Certificate of Kiln Drying.
(9) The derogation provided for in this Decision should be terminated if it is established that the specific conditions laid down in this Decision are not sufficient to prevent the introduction of harmful organisms into the Union or have not been complied with or there is evidence which could indicate that the Program is not functioning effectively.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,","{'header': '20.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 346/61', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 18 December 2013\nproviding for a derogation from Article 13(1)(ii) of Council Directive 2000/29/EC in respect of bark-free sawn wood ofQuercusL.,PlatanusL. andAcer saccharumMarsh. originating in the United States of America\n(notified under document C(2013) 9166)\n(2013/780/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2000/29/EC provides for protective measures against the introduction into the Union from third countries of organisms that are harmful to plants or plant products.\n\n((2)) Bark-free sawn wood ofQuercusL.,PlatanusL. andAcer saccharumMarsh. originating in the United States of America and covered by one of the CN codes and the descriptions set out in Section I(6) of Part B of Annex V to Directive 2000/29/EC may not be introduced into the Union unless accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate as provided for in Article 13(1)(ii) of that Directive.\n\n((3)) Directive 2000/29/EC allows for derogations from Article 13(1)(ii) in the case of wood, if equivalent safeguards are ensured by means of alternative documentation or marking.\n\n((4)) The Commission has noted on the basis of information supplied by the United States of America that an official programme, the Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Lumber Certification Program, has been approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, US Department of Agriculture and will be operated by the US National Hardwood Lumber Association (NHLA).\n\n((5)) The Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Lumber Certification Program ensures that approved hardwood facilities in the US operate under the Kiln Drying Sawn Hardwood Standard.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.

(2) Pursuant to Article 17(3)(a) of Directive 92/65/EEC Community on-the-spot visits have to be carried out to ensure the uniform application of the abovementioned Directive, and in particular its Annexes.
(3) Therefore it is justified to draw up a provisional list of centres approved for the collection of semen of equidae for imports into the European Community, for which the competent authorities of the third country concerned provided guarantees equivalent to those of Chapter II of Directive 92/65/EEC.
(4) The provisional list should specify for each centre the ISO-code and the name of the third country, the name, address and the registration number of the centre, the approving authority and the date of approval.
(5) It will be necessary to re-examine and, if necessary, to amend this Decision in the light of new information from time to time.
(6) Iceland is considered free of equine infectious anaemia and no testing is required for imports of live equidae from Iceland. Consequently the test requirements for this disease laid down in Decision 96/539/EC(6), imports of equine semen, and Decision 96/540/EC(7), imports of equine ova and embryos, should be suspended for such imports from Iceland.

accepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia
(2005/622/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the basic Regulation), and in particular Articles 8 and 9 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
(1) On 28 May 2004, the Commission announced by a notice (notice of initiation), published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America (USA) and Russia, and the initiation of an interim review of the anti-dumping duty on imports of certain grain oriented electrical sheets with a width of more than 500 mm originating in Russia.
(2) Given the need to further examine certain aspects of the investigation and also because of the interrelation with the abovementioned interim review, it was decided to continue the investigation without the imposition of provisional measures.
(3) The Commission therefore subsequently continued the investigation of dumping, injury and Community interest, and the definitive findings and conclusions of this investigation are set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005 (3) imposing definitive anti-dumping duties on imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia (the definitive Regulation).
(4) The investigation confirmed the provisional findings of injurious dumping relating to imports of the product concerned originating in Russia and the USA.
B.   UNDERTAKING
(5) Subsequent to the disclosure of the definitive findings, one cooperating exporting producer in Russia (Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation) and one in the USA (AK Steel Corporation) offered a price undertaking in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic Regulation. In this undertaking, the exporting producers in question has offered to sell the product concerned at or above price levels that eliminate the injurious effect of dumping.
(6) The companies will also provide the Commission with regular and detailed information concerning its exports to the Community, meaning that the undertaking can be monitored effectively by the Commission. Furthermore, the sales structure of the companies is such that the Commission considers that the risk of circumvention of the undertaking is limited.
(7) In view of this, it is considered that the undertaking is acceptable.
(8) In order to enable the Commission to monitor effectively the company's compliance with the undertaking, when the request for release for free circulation pursuant to the undertaking is presented to the relevant customs authority, exemption from the duty will be conditional on presentation of a commercial invoice containing at least the items of information listed in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1371/2005. This level of information is also necessary to enable customs authorities to ascertain with sufficient precision that the shipment corresponds to the commercial documents. Where no such invoice is presented, or when it does not correspond to the product presented to customs, the appropriate amount of anti-dumping duty will instead be payable.
(9) In the event of a breach or withdrawal of the undertaking, or a suspected breach, an anti-dumping duty may be imposed pursuant to Article 8(9) and (10) of the basic Regulation,","{'header': '27.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 223/42', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 5\xa0August 2005\naccepting undertakings offered in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia\n(2005/622/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article\xa01', 'text': 'Article\xa01\nThe undertaking offered by the producers mentioned in the accompanying table, in connection with the present anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of grain oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel originating in the United States of America and Russia is hereby accepted.\nCountry\nCompany\nTARIC additional code\nRussia\nProduced and sold by Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation (NLMK), 2, Metallurgov Square, Lipetsk,\nor,\nProduced by Novolipetsk Iron & Steel Corporation (NLMK), 2, Metallurgov Square, Lipetsk, and sold by Stinol AG, Lugano, Switzerland, to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer\nA674\nUSA\nProduced by AK Steel Corporation, 703, Curtis Street, Middletown, Ohio,\nor,\nProduced by AK Steel Corporation, 703, Curtis Street, Middletown, Ohio, and sold by AK Steel BV, Oosterhout, The Netherlands, to the first independent customer in the Community acting as an importer.\nA673'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article\xa02', 'text': 'Article\xa02\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

(2) There is considerable scope for procedural differences in the treatment of price reductions and the relationship between price reductions and purchase price.

It will also improve their reliability and relevance.
(3) Prices used in the HICP should be purchaser prices actually paid by households to purchase individual goods and services in monetary transactions, including any taxes less subsidies on the products, after deductions for discounts for bulk or off-peak purchases from standard prices or charges, and excluding interest or services charges added under credit arrangements and any extra charges incurred as a result of failing to pay within the period stated at the time the purchases were made.
(4) In the event of changes in specification, prices should be treated in accordance with the rules regarding quality adjustment set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1749/96 of 9 September 1996 on initial implementing measures for Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices(3), as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1688/98(4).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(1), and in particular Articles 19 and 20 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) According to Decision 90/424/EEC the Community is to undertake the scientific measures necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation.
(2) A quantitative assessment of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) residual risk in gelatine, tallow and dicalcium phosphate from bovine bones, tallow from fat tissues and tallow from rendered mixtures of tissues is currently being carried out. The methodology for that assessment was adopted by the former Scientific Steering Committee at its meeting of 12 and 13 September 2002.
(3) The current work undertaken on the assessment of the residual BSE risk needs to be updated in the light of new scientific evidence.
(4) Cross-contamination by feed containing animal proteins and intended for non-ruminants is considered to be the main remaining source of BSE infection since the introduction of the ruminant feed ban in 1994. Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies(2) prohibits the feeding of animal protein to farmed animals, with the exception of certain animal proteins, the ""extended feed ban"". Despite the extended feed ban, very small amounts of animal proteins are detected in a limited number of samples of feedingstuffs.
(5) It is therefore necessary to extend the current risk assessment to an assessment of the risk posed by feed containing limited amounts of meat-and-bone meal. This extension could also consider the variation of the residual risk posed by the presence of the vertebral column according to the age of the animals.
(6) The measures provided for in this Decision are necessary for the development of Community veterinary legislation and should, therefore, qualify for a financial contribution from the Community.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': '2004/110/EC: Commission Decision of 29 January 2004 on measures to assess the residual BSE risk in products derived from bovine animals/on a Community financial contribution for measures to assess the residual BSE risk in products derived from bovine animals (notified under document number C(2004) 132)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Commission shall ensure that the current scientific work on a quantitative risk assessment of the residual BSE risk is updated in view of new scientific evidence, and shall in particular ensure the inclusion in this assessment of the residual BSE risks posed by feed containing low amounts of meat-and-bone meal.\n\nThe Commission shall report on the outcome of the risk assessment to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular the second alternative of Article 21(3) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Directive 2009/37/EC (2) included copper compounds as active substance in Annex I to Council Directive 91/414/EEC (3), under the condition that the Member States concerned ensure that the notifier at whose request copper compounds were included in that Annex provides further confirmatory information on the risk from inhalation and on the risk assessment for non-target organisms and for soil and water.
(2) Active substances included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC are deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 and are listed in Part A of the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 (4).
(3) The notifier submitted additional information taking the form of studies on the risk from inhalation and on the risk assessment for non-target organisms and for soil and water to the rapporteur Member State France within the time period provided for its submission.
(4) France assessed the additional information submitted by the notifier. It submitted its assessment, in the form of an addendum to the draft assessment report, to the other Member States, the Commission and the European Food Safety Authority, hereinafter 'the Authority', on 8 June 2012.
(5) The Commission consulted the Authority which presented its opinion on the risk assessment of copper compounds on 22 May 2013 (5).
(6) The Commission invited the notifier to submit its comments on the review report for copper compounds.
(7) In the light of the additional information provided by the notifier, the Commission considered that the further confirmatory information required had not been fully provided and that, in particular, the specific provision of row 277 of Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, concerning monitoring programmes for contamination by copper, is not sufficient to conclude on the environmental risk assessment.
(8) It is confirmed that the active substance copper compounds is to be deemed to have been approved under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009. It is, in particular, appropriate to require that the notifier presents to the Commission, the Authority and the Member States a monitoring programme for areas where the contamination of soil and water (including sediments) by copper is a concern or may become one, in order to verify whether further limitations of use are necessary to prevent any unacceptable environmental effect. The results of that monitoring programme should also be presented.
(9) The maximum levels for certain heavy metals, as set in row 277 of Part A of the Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011, were by mistake set with wrong measurement unit from those set in the respective FAO specifications. The maximum level set in the Annex to that Implementing Regulation should therefore be corrected.
(10) The Annex to Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(11) Member States should be provided with time to amend or withdraw authorisations for plant protection products containing copper compounds.
(12) For plant protection products containing copper compounds, where Member States grant any grace period in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, this period should expire at the latest 18 months after the entry into force of this Regulation.

Whereas:
(1) The accounts of the European Central Bank (ECB) and of the national central banks of the Eurosystem are to be audited by independent external auditors recommended by the Governing Council of the ECB and approved by the Council of the European Union.
(2) Pursuant to Article 37(1) of the Federal Act on the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the General Meeting of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) must elect two auditors and two alternate auditors each year. The alternate auditors will be mandated only in the event that the auditors are not able to perform the audit.
(3) On 14 March 2006 the Council of the European Union, having regard to Recommendation ECB/2006/1 of 1 February 2006 to the Council of the European Union on the external auditors of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (2), approved KPMG Alpen-Treuhand GmbH and TPA Horwath Wirtschaftsprüfung GmbH as joint external auditors, and Moore Stephens Austria Wirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft mbH and BDO Auxilia Treuhand GmbH as joint alternate auditors for the financial year 2006 (3).

Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in poultry and birds, causing mortality and disturbances which can quickly take epizootic proportions liable to present a serious threat to animal and public health and to reduce sharply the profitability of poultry farming. There is a risk that the disease agent might be introduced via international trade in live poultry and poultry products.
(2) Isarel has notified to the Commission the isolation of an H5 avian influenza virus collected from a clinical case. The clinical picture allows the suspicion of highly pathogenic avian influenza pending the determination of the neuraminidase (N) type.
(3) In view of the animal health risk of disease introduction into the Community, it is therefore appropriate as an immediate measure to suspend imports of live poultry, ratites, farmed and wild feathered game birds, live birds other than poultry and hatching eggs of these species from Israel.
(4) As Israel is authorised for imports of game trophies and eggs for human consumption, imports into the Community of these products should be suspended as well because of the animal health risk involved.
(5) Furthermore the importation into the Community from Israel should be suspended for fresh meat of poultry, ratites and wild and farmed feathered game and importation of meat preparations, minced meat, mechanically separated meat and meat products consisting of or containing meat of those species.
(6) Certain products derived from poultry slaughtered before 15 February 2006 should also continue to be authorised, taking into account the incubation period of the disease.
(7) Commission Decision 2005/432/EC (3) laying down the animal and public health conditions and model certificates for imports of meat products for human consumption from third countries and repealing Decisions 97/41/EC, 97/221/EC and 97/222/EC lays down the list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of meat products and establishes treatment regimes considered effective in inactivating the respective pathogens. In order to prevent the risk of disease transmission via such products, appropiate treatment must be applied depending on the health status of the country of origin and the species the product is obtained from. It appears therefore appropriate, that imports of poultry meat products originating in Israel and treated to a temperature of at least 70 °C throughout the product should continue to be authorised.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 10 February 1993 concerning aid which Italy has decided to grant through AIMA for the private storage of hazelnuts (Only the Italian text is authentic)
(93/255/EEC)THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1754/92 (2), and in particular Article 31 thereof,
After giving notice to the parties concerned to submit comments (3), in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty, and after taking due account of same,
Whereas:
I  1. By letter dated 10 April 1991, recorded as received on 29 April 1991, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Communities notified the Commission, pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, of a national programme established by the  Ajienda di Stato per gli interventi nel Mercato Agricolo (AIMA) to aid the private storage of hazelnuts.
2. The measure involves the grant of Lit 16 000 per quintal and per month for the storage of a total quantity of 200 000 quintals of hazelnuts.
The Italian Government justified the measure on the grounds of the difficulties affecting the market in hazelnuts.
II  1. By letter No SG(91) D/12522 of 3 July 1991 the Commission informed the Italian Government that it had decided to initiate the procedure provided for in Article 93 (2) of the Treaty in respect of this aid.
2. In that letter the Commission informed the Italian authorities that it considered the aid to be an operating aid incompatible with the Commission's standing philosophy regarding the application of Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty; such a measure  has the direct effect of artificially reducing cost prices and improving the conditions under which the producers concerned produce and dispose of their products as compared with other producers in other Member States who do not qualify for comparable  aid.
It is accordingly liable to distort competition and affect trade between Member States and meets the criteria laid down in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty without qualifying under the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (2) and (3).
Moreover, the measure constitutes an infringement of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 and Council Regulations (EEC) No 789/89 (4) and (EEC) No 790/89 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 832/92 (6).
This Regulation must be considered a comprehensive and exhaustive system which bars the Member State from taking supplementary measures.
3. The Commission gave the Italian Government notice, under this procedure, to submit its comments.
The Commission also requested the other Member States and interested parties to submit their comments.
III  By telex dated 1 August 1991, the Italian Government replied to the Commission's letter of 3 July 1991; it made the following comments:
1. the measure, according to the Italian authorities, has a developmental effect on the sector concerned which has been in economic difficulties for several years now.
The measure aims in particular to encourage activities to improve the quality of services before and after sale with a view to facilitating the adjustment of the products in question to the needs of the market of destination and, consequently, to make  such services more competitive in relation to the production of third countries;
2. the measure is not an operating aid according to the Italian authorities; rather, it is likely to encourage the development of a sector in need of upgrading - a need which was also acknowledged by the Community.
By telex dated 14 August 1991 the Italian authorities informed the Commission that the aforementioned aid, having been implemented from 22 September 1990, had been withdrawn.
IV  1. The Italian authorities have failed to fulfil their obligations pursuant to Article 93 (3) of the Treaty, firstly by not notifying the measure at the planning stage, and secondly by putting it into effect on 22 September 1990 without first giving  the Commission the opportunity of expressing its views.
Such irregularities have given rise to a particularly serious situation in that the aid is, in its substance and for the reasons set out below, in breach of the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables and is incompatible with the  common market pursuant to Article 92 of the Treaty.
2. With regard to the arguments put forward by the Italian authorities, the following must be emphasized:
Each common organization of the market is characterized by the fact that, for a given sector, any possibility of national market organization measures is ruled out, Community measures taking their place instead.
The Italian authorities may no longer, even in critical market situations, adopt measures other than those authorized by the rules governing the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables.
That common organization, along with Regulations (EEC) No 789/89 and (EEC) No 790/89, is to be seen as a complete and exhaustive system which leaves the Member State no power to take any supplementary measures with regard to the operation of the market  organization concerned.
The aid scheme which, contrary to the opinion of the Italian authorities, is by its nature an operating measure and not a structural one, is therefore incompatible with the common market and does not qualify for any of the exceptions provided for in
Article 92
(3) of the Treaty.
In view of the foregoing, the reasons put forward by the Italian authorities cannot be accepted.
V  Italian hazelnut production in 1990 was estimated at around 101 400 tonnes, while that of the Community as a whole stood at 153 450 tonnes (7). During that period, imports into Italy of hazelnuts from the other Member States amounted to 1 475 tonnes  and those from non-member countries amounted to 651 tonnes. Italian exports of this product to the other Member States amounted to 3 404 tonnes and those to non-member countries reached 1 529 tonnes.
The aid involves a quantity equal to 20 000 tonnes of hazelnuts, representing a fifth of Italian production; this measure could thus have an appreciable effect on the marketing of the product.
VI  1. Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty apply to the production and marketing of hazelnuts by virtue of Article 31 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.
2. Aid for the private storage of hazelnuts constitutes an operating aid for the benefit of producers, producer associations, their groups, and traders active in this sector. The aid enables the beneficiaries to reduce storage costs and benefit from  more advantageous prices than would be the case without the State aid.
The measure could, therefore, distort competition between beneficiaries of the aid and other non-beneficiary operators in the same sector in Italy and elsewhere in the Community.
Morever, this reduction in storage costs reduces the overhead costs of marketing the product in question and enables Italian producer groups and associations and interested traders to sell the product in Italy and in the other Member States on more  favourable terms. The aid makes them more competitive on the markets of the other Member States and is therefore likely to affect trade between Member States.
The measures in question therefore fulfil the criteria set out in Article 92 (1) of the Treaty, according to which the aid to which it relates is incompatible with the common market.
3. The exceptions to such incompatibility set out in Article 92 (2) are clearly not applicable to the aid in question. Those set out in Article 92 (3) relate to the objectives pursued in the Community's interest and not only in the interest of  individual sectors of the national economy. Those exceptions are to be strictly interpreted when examining any regional or sectoral aid or any case of individual application of general aid schemes.
Exceptions can be granted only in cases where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary for achieving one of the objectives set out in those provisions. To allow such exceptions in respect of aid which does not offer such benefits would  amount to allowing trade between Member States to be affected and competition to be distorted without justification from the point of view of the Community interest and would give an unfair advantage to operators in certain Member States.
In the case in point, the aid does not offer such benefits. The Italian Government was unable to provide any justification, and the Commission could find none, to show that the aid in question met the conditions required for the application of one of  the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
The measure is not one intended to promote an important project of common European interest, as referred to in Article 92 (3) (b), given that its likely effects on trade run counter to the common interest. Nor is it a measure intended to remedy a  serious disturbance in the economy of the Member State concerned, within the meaning of that provision.
As regards the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) for aid to promote and facilitate the economic development of certain areas or of certain activities referred to in subparagraph (c), it should be noted that the measure, as an operating  aid, cannot bring about a lasting improvement in the conditions obtaining in the holdings and enterprises attracting the aid since, once it ceases to be granted, their structural situation will revert to what it was before State intervention began to  operate.
Accordingly, the aid is to be regarded as one which does not benefit from any of the exemptions set out in Article 92 (2) and (3) of the Treaty.
4. Moreover, it must be remembered that the aid concerns a product which is subject to a market organization and that there are restrictions on the powers of the Member States to intervene independently in the operation of a market organization  comprising a common support system, this being now the exclusive responsibility of the Community.
The grant of the aid in this sector disregards the rule under which Member States are no longer empowered to decide unilaterally on farmers' income within a common organization of the market by granting aids of this type. Even if a derogation pursuant  to Aricle 92 (3) of the Treaty had been conceivable for the agricultural product in question, the fact that the aid measure breaches the market organization concerned rules out the application of such a derogation.
5. The aid in question is therefore incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty.
6. This Decision is without prejudice to any measures the Commission may see fit to take as regards the financing of the common agricultural policy by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF),","{'title': '93/255/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 February 1993 concerning aid which Italy has decided to grant through AIMA for the private storage of hazelnuts (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '92', 'title': 'Article 92', 'text': ""Article 92\n\n(3) of the Treaty.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the reasons put forward by the Italian authorities cannot be accepted.\n\nV  Italian hazelnut production in 1990 was estimated at around 101 400 tonnes, while that of the Community as a whole stood at 153 450 tonnes (7). During that period, imports into Italy of hazelnuts from the other Member States amounted to 1 475 tonnes  and those from non-member countries amounted to 651 tonnes. Italian exports of this product to the other Member States amounted to 3 404 tonnes and those to non-member countries reached 1 529 tonnes.\n\nThe aid involves a quantity equal to 20 000 tonnes of hazelnuts, representing a fifth of Italian production; this measure could thus have an appreciable effect on the marketing of the product.\n\nVI  1. Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the Treaty apply to the production and marketing of hazelnuts by virtue of Article 31 of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72.\n\n2. Aid for the private storage of hazelnuts constitutes an operating aid for the benefit of producers, producer associations, their groups, and traders active in this sector. The aid enables the beneficiaries to reduce storage costs and benefit from  more advantageous prices than would be the case without the State aid.\n\nThe measure could, therefore, distort competition between beneficiaries of the aid and other non-beneficiary operators in the same sector in Italy and elsewhere in the Community.\n\nMorever, this reduction in storage costs reduces the overhead costs of marketing the product in question and enables Italian producer groups and associations and interested traders to sell the product in Italy and in the other Member States on more  favourable terms.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity (1), and in particular Article 19 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letter dated 16 June 2004 France requested authorisation to apply differentiated levels of taxation to gas oil and unleaded petrol for the purposes of an administrative reform involving the decentralisation of certain specific powers currently exercised by central government.
(2) The decentralisation planned by France is part of an approach designed to increase administrative effectiveness by improving the quality and reducing the cost of public services. It is also part of a policy of subsidiarity, allowing for decisions to be adopted on many domains at the appropriate level. The possibility of regional differentiation offers regions an additional incentive to improve the quality of their administration in a transparent fashion. The reductions should be linked to the socioeconomic conditions of the regions in which they are applied.
(3) Derogations cannot be authorised for indefinite periods. Article 19(2) of Directive 2003/96/EC restricts the duration of further exemptions or reductions of taxation applicable to energy and electricity products to six years with the possibility of renewal.
(4) The low level of differentiation of the excise rates between regions and the differences in retail prices among distribution networks imply that the risk of traffic detours and, consequently, the risk of an increase in environmentally damaging emissions will be very low. This will also meet the needs of the energy policy.
(5) The intra-Community commercial movement of diesel and unleaded petrol takes place almost completely under duty suspension arrangements. This form of intra-Community movement is not affected by the devolution of excise duties contemplated by France. For the very limited number of cases where commercial movement takes place under duty-paid arrangements, the planned procedures of control are of a non-discriminatory nature and, subject to a regular review of their practicalities, without real impact on the intra-Community movement of duty-paid products. Under these conditions, the decentralisation of excise duties does not seem to hinder the proper functioning of the internal market.
(6) The very tight limits set for the differentiation of duty rates between regions should ensure that the decentralisation of excise duties will not distort competition on the oil products market. Moreover, the differentiation should be compensated by the large price differences among distribution networks. As the requested measure does not apply to commercial diesel, any distortion of competition on the freight and passenger transport markets should be excluded.
(7) The increase in national rates which will precede the possibility of regional reductions in rates leads to the conclusion that the application of the French measure should not in principle result in any hindrance to Community policy on environmental protection.
(8) The Commission regularly reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they do not distort competition or hinder the operation of the internal market and are not incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment, energy and transport,","{'header': '4.11.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 290/25', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 24 October 2005\nauthorising France to apply differentiated levels of taxation to motor fuels in accordance with Article 19 of Directive 2003/96/EC\n(2005/767/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letter dated 16 June 2004 France requested authorisation to apply differentiated levels of taxation to gas oil and unleaded petrol for the purposes of an administrative reform involving the decentralisation of certain specific powers currently exercised by central government.\n\n((2)) The decentralisation planned by France is part of an approach designed to increase administrative effectiveness by improving the quality and reducing the cost of public services.

Whereas:
(1) Article 3 of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that, where prices within the Community are higher than world market prices, the difference between these prices may be covered by a refund when olive oil is exported to third countries.
(2) The detailed rules for fixing and granting export refunds on olive oil are contained in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 616/72(3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2962/77(4).
(3) Article 3(3) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC provides that the refund must be the same for the whole Community.
(4) In accordance with Article 3(4) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, the refund for olive oil must be fixed in the light of the existing situation and outlook in relation to olive oil prices and availability on the Community market and olive oil prices on the world market. However, where the world market situation is such that the most favourable olive oil prices cannot be determined, account may be taken of the price of the main competing vegetable oils on the world market and the difference recorded between that price and the price of olive oil during a representative period. The amount of the refund may not exceed the difference between the price of olive oil in the Community and that on the world market, adjusted, where appropriate, to take account of export costs for the products on the world market.
(5) In accordance with Article 3(3) third indent, point (b) of Regulation No 136/66/EEC, it may be decided that the refund shall be fixed by tender. The tendering procedure should cover the amount of the refund and may be limited to certain countries of destination, quantities, qualities and presentations.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 21 December 1992  on a multiannual guidance programme for the fishing fleet of France for the period 1993 to 1996  pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 (Only the French text is authentic) (92/588/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 of 18 December 1986 on Community measures to  improve and adapt structures in the fisheries and aquaculture sector (1), as last amended by  Regulation (EEC) N° 3946/92 (2),
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) N° 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for  the conservation and management of fishery resources (3), and in particular Article 2 (d) thereof,  lists as one of its objectives conservation measures consisting of restricting fishing effort;
Whereas the resolution of the European Parliament on the Commission's 1991 report on the common  fisheries policy (4) refers to the structural adjustment of the fleet through the adoption of a new  generation of MGPs ensuring a reduction in fishing capacity differentiated according to region and  fishery;
Whereas at its meeting of 3 April 1992 the Council concluded that in order to ensure the continuity  of fisheries, one of the objectives of the future common fisheries policy must be to re-establish  the balance between resources and fishing effort, including capacity, and to maintain a balanced  and rational management of resources;
Whereas the Economic and Social Committee, in its opinion on the 1991 report delivered on 27 May  1992, takes the view that the MGPs are an essential means of matching fishing capacity to  exploitable resources and that further reduction of the Community's fleet must be differentiated;
Whereas on 30 April 1991 the French Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance  programme for the fishing fleet for the period 1992 to 1996, herinafter called 'the programme`, in  accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86; whereas it later forwarded additional  information concerning the programme;
Whereas it is necessary to consider whether the programme fulfils the conditions laid down in  Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86 and constitutes a suitable framework for Community and  national financial aid for the sector concerned;
Whereas the objectives for reducing fleet capacity fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programme constitute the reference basis for assessing the actual development recorded and the  effort still needed to ensure that the objectives are achieved;
Whereas the Commission adopted a transitional programme for 1992 (1); whereas the objectives fixed  in the French transitional programme should be included in the objectives of the present  programme;
Whereas it is important that the overall reduction in fishing effort judged to be necessary in  order to adapt the Community fleet to available resources should reflect significant reductions in  particular segments of that fleet where an imbalance is most apparent; whereas coefficients for the  reduction of fishing effort, differentiated according to fishery or group of fisheries, should  therefore be applied to the segments of the fleet thus identified;
Whereas account must be taken of an annual increase of 2 % in fishing effort linked to technical  progress;
Whereas available biological and economic analyses suggest that overall reduction in fishing  effort, differentiated for the broad groups of target species, should be of 20 % for demersal  species, 15 % for benthic species and zero growth in effort for pelagic species;
Whereas, in order to attain these objectives and improve fishing methods, reductions in effort  should primarily be focused on segments of the fleet using non-selective gear, particularly those  likely to catch large numbers of juveniles, while ensuring that there is no increase in segments  using more selective gear;.
Whereas, in order to attain the objectives of the programme, it may be necessary to take steps to  influence all the parameters connected with fishing mortality, particularly the capacity and  activity of the fleet; whereas, however, structural measures must be focused chiefly on the  elimination of excess capacity;

Segmentation Segmentation of the fleet shall take account of the different resources fished and fishing zones  (coastal, Community and international/third country, Mediterranean and waters of the remotest  Community regions), the groups of species targeted (demersal, benthic and pelagic) and the gear  used.\n\nThe segments thus determined shall be homogeneous and distinct, i.e. the objectives fixed for each  segment must be attained by the end of the programme.\n\n2. Final objectives for each segment The final objectives shall be fixed in terms of capacity (tonnage in GRT and engine power in kW) on  the basis of the initial objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the transitional programme for  1992.\n\nThe following formula shall be used to determine the objective for each segment:\n\nLet (a) be a segment for which the capacity in tonnage and engine power at 1 January 1992 is known  and to which a reduction coefficient (y) is applied.\n\nSegment objective (a) = (1 y) × situation at 1. 1. 1992 × overall objective at 31. 12. 1991overall  situation at 1. 1. 1992 3.

Annual intermediate objectives In order to ensure proper monitoring based on the gradual achievement of the objectives fixed in  the programme, annual intermediate objectives shall be set for the programme. These objectives  shall be expressed as a percentage of the objectives fixed on 31 December 1991 in the previous  programmes.\n\nIn addition to the single objective of 2 % fixed in the transitional programme for 1992, a  percentage equal to 25 % of the overall objective less 2 % should be achieved in each year of the  programme, starting from 31 December 1993.\n\n5. Implementation and monitoring Implementation of the measures to reduce the activity of vessels in certain segments of the fleet  will require that the Member State provide the Commission with the assurance that it will have the  following information for each of the segments concerned:\n\n- the data on the level of activity prior to the entry into force of the measures (reference basis:  1991),\n\n- assurance that it has effective time at sea management tools and is able to manage licensing  schemes, particularly with regard to multipurpose vessels,\n\n- data for monitoring the effect of the measures implemented under this programme in accordance  with Article 2 and the rules on the Community register of fishing vessels. Such measures must  produce effects which can be checked by the Commission pursuant to the Community rules on  controls.\n\n6. Planned measures Notwithstanding Articles 6 and 9 of Regulation (EEC) N° 4028/86, priority shall be given to:\n\n- measures to adjust fishing capacity in line with exploitable resources,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels in order to bring them into line with Community rules on  hygiene and safety,\n\n- investments to improve fishing methods and allow fishing which is more selective and/or less  damaging to the marine environment,\n\n- investments carried out on board vessels to improve the control of fishing operations.\n\nThe Commission hereby reminds local, regional and national authorities that any structural aid  granted to the sector in question must be included in the present programme.\n\n7. Revision of the programme The programme may be revised, on the initiative of the Commission, in the light of the experience  gained and the national and Community rules in force, in order to take account of new factors which  might help improve the implementation of the programme and ensure that its objectives are better  met.\n\nSuch revision must take place before the end of 1994.\n\nRevision may, if necessary, include the insertion into the programme of the tools for managing  measures to reduce the activity of fishing vessels for certain segments of the fleet. To this end  the objectives of the segments concerned will be expressed in a unit of measurement of capacity  (engine power and/or tonnage) per activity (time at sea), or using any other formula approved by  the Commission.\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Whereas the structural policies implemented by the Community in the aquaculture sector must have development objectives which are compatible with all Community policies and must contribute to the establishment of the common economic area;
Whereas those objectives must ensure more far-reaching economic and social cohesion while allowing market rules to apply;
Whereas it is more important to create the conditions favourable to development than to make provision for specific measures only;
Whereas steps should be taken to coordinate, in a comprehensive and coherent framework, the operations of the financial instruments both in the Community and in the Member States;
Whereas, in areas where it is being developed, aquaculture interacts with the natural environment; whereas, in certain circumstances, aquaculture may in some cases affect the environment positively and in others negatively;
Whereas Council Directives 91/67/EEC (3), 91/492/EEC (4) and 91/493/EEC (5) harmonize the rules governing animal health and public health as applied to fish farms;
Whereas pressure on space and in particular intense competition regarding the use of the coastline are a major constraint on the development of aquaculture; whereas it is essential, therefore, that preference be given to a policy of identifying sites  which are suitable for the development of aquaculture as an integral part of the landscape and to coastline development projects;
Whereas the future of aquaculture will be determined also by the ability of the industry to increase the range of production by operating experimental farms and pilot projects arising from research;
Whereas the Netherlands Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for aquaculture and the provision of protected marine areas, hereinafter called 'the programme'; whereas on 20 November 1991 it forwarded the latest  additional information concerning the programme;
Whereas the aim of the programme is to reduce operating costs and improve the productivity of existing farms, to develop the rearing of new species and raise the health and environmental standards of existing aquaculture farms in the Netherlands;  whereas the Member State considers that approximately ECU 22 million are necessary for the completion of the programme; whereas the approval of the programme is without prejudice to any later selection of individual investment projects;
Whereas the programme concerns all the structural policies implemented in the aquaculture sector of the Member State concerned;
Whereas the aquaculture sector is developing within a commercial framework, a feature of which is the growth of international competition; whereas the development of the market in aquaculture species could entail the need to adjust the objectives for  the production of certain species;
Whereas flexible planning is required based on routine monitoring of the factors of production and market conditions; whereas a close watch needs to be kept on the programme, therefore, and this can only be done if reliable figures are available which  are regularly updated and which apply to the national territory as a whole;

establishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) The European Council has repeatedly underlined its strong preference for accession by a reunited Cyprus. As yet, a comprehensive settlement has not been reached.
(2) The Council of 26 April 2004, considering that the Turkish Cypriot community had expressed their clear desire for a future within the European Union, recommended that the funds earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a settlement should be used to put an end to the isolation of that community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community, with particular emphasis on the economic integration of the island and on improving contact between the two communities and with the EU.
(3) Following the accession of Cyprus, the application of the acquis is suspended pursuant to Article 1(1) of Protocol No 10 of the Act of Accession 2003 in the areas of the Republic of Cyprus in which the Government of the Republic of Cyprus does not exercise effective control (hereinafter referred to as ‘the areas’).
(4) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Protocol No 10, nothing in the Protocol precludes measures with a view to promoting the economic development of the areas.
(5) Measures to be financed under this Regulation are of an exceptional and transitional nature and are intended, in particular, to prepare and facilitate, as appropriate, the full application of the acquis communautaire in the areas following a solution to the Cyprus problem.
(6) With a view to allocating the financial support in the most efficient and rapid way, it is desirable to provide that assistance can be supplied directly to the beneficiaries.
(7) In order to supply assistance in accordance with the principles of sound financial management, the Commission should be in a position to delegate to the European Agency for Reconstruction implementation of assistance under this Regulation. Therefore, Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction (1) needs to be amended accordingly.
(8) The development and restructuring of infrastructure, in particular in the areas of energy and transport, the environment, telecommunications and water supply should take account of island-wide planning, where appropriate.
(9) In the implementation of actions financed under this Regulation, the rights of natural and legal persons, including the rights to possessions and property, should be respected.
(10) Nothing in this Regulation is intended to imply recognition of any public authority in the areas other than the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.
(11) In accordance with Article 2 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (2), measures for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted by use of the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.
(12) Implementing this Regulation contributes, as set out above, to the achievement of Community objectives, but the Treaty provides for no powers, other than those referred to in Article 308 thereof, for the adoption of this Regulation,","{'header': '7.3.2006 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 65/5', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 389/2006\nof 27 February 2006\nestablishing an instrument of financial support for encouraging the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community and amending Council Regulation (EC) No 2667/2000 on the European Agency for Reconstruction', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The European Council has repeatedly underlined its strong preference for accession by a reunited Cyprus.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex III to Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 or in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 15(2) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 of the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.

(3) Article 10(5) of Protocol No 36 allows the United Kingdom to notify the Council of its wish to participate in the above acts, including those acts which are part of the Schengen acquis, in which case the relevant provisions of the Schengen Protocol should apply.
(4) By letter to the President of the Council and to the President of the Commission taking effect on 1 December 2014, the United Kingdom made use of the above possibility by notifying the Council of its wish to participate in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis which are contained in acts of the Union in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters to which it was already taking part in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC (1), Council Decision 2004/926/EC (2) and Article 5(1) of the Schengen Protocol.
(5) It is therefore necessary to identify the acts and provisions in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters which are part of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom will continue to participate following the above notification of its wish to do so and therefore to amend Decision 2000/365/EC and Decision 2004/926/EC.
(6) Decision 2000/365/EC and Decision 2004/926/EC, as amended, will thus continue to apply, in particular concerning those provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom was authorised to take part and which are not acts and provisions in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as referred to in Article 10(1) of Protocol No 36.
(7) Likewise, the United Kingdom will continue to participate in those acts and provisions of the Schengen acquis for which it was authorised to take part, which although they are acts and provisions in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters adopted before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, have been amended by an act, applicable to the United Kingdom, adopted after that entry into force and which therefore fall under Article 10(2) of Protocol No 36. This is the case with regard to the Decision of the Executive Committee of 16 September 1998 (3) on the Schengen Evaluation Mechanism, which was amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013 (4), and to Articles 48 to 53 of the 1990 Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 as well as the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (5) and its Protocol (6), which were amended by Directive 2014/41/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (7). This is also the case with regard to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis
 (8), which was amended by the Protocol on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to that Agreement (9) (hereinafter ‘the Agreement of 2008 on Switzerland's association with the Schengen acquis’).
(8) As recalled in Decision 2000/365/EC, the United Kingdom has a special position in respect of matters covered by Title V of Part Three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as recognised in the Schengen Protocol, as well as in Protocol No 20 on the application of certain aspects of Article 26 of the TFEU to the United Kingdom and to Ireland (hereinafter ‘Protocol No 20’) and Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland in respect of the area of Freedom, Security and Justice (hereinafter ‘Protocol No 21’), annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the TFEU. Due to this special position, the Schengen Protocol provides for the possibility of the United Kingdom to participate in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis.
(9) In accordance with Article 10(5) of Protocol No 36, the participation of the United Kingdom in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis which are contained in acts of the Union in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as provided in this Decision re-establishes the widest possible measure of participation of the United Kingdom in the Schengen acquis of the Union in the area of freedom, security and justice without seriously affecting the practical operability of the various parts thereof, while respecting their coherence.
(10) As recalled in Decision 2000/365/EC, the Schengen acquis was conceived and functions as a coherent ensemble which has to be fully accepted and applied by all States supporting the principle of the abolition of checks on persons at their common borders.
(11) The implementing power to adopt the decisions under Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of Decision 2000/365/EC, whereby the Schengen acquis will be applied to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man and the relevant acquis on the Schengen Information System will be put into effect for the United Kingdom, should be conferred on the Council. This is in view of the specific role entrusted to the Council by the Schengen Protocol when it comes to unanimously agreeing on new participants into the Schengen acquis, but also in view of the high level of mutual trust between the Member States which is required when examining that the preconditions for the implementation of the provisions on the Schengen Information System have been fulfilled and when taking the subsequent decision by which those provisions will be put into effect for the United Kingdom. The Council should act with the unanimity of its members referred to in Article 1 of the Schengen Protocol and of the representative of the Government of the United Kingdom.
(12) In accordance with Article 2 of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on the establishment of rights and obligations between Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, on the one hand, and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, on the other, in areas of the Schengen acquis which apply to these States (10), the Mixed Committee established pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application, and development of the Schengen acquis

THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK
,
Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank and in particular Article 28.5 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The adjustment of the weightings assigned to the national central banks (NCBs) in the expanded key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s (ECB’s) capital (hereinafter the capital key weightings and the capital key respectively) as provided for in Decision ECB/2004/5 of 22 April 2004 on the national central banks' percentage shares in the key for subscription to the European Central Bank’s capital (1) requires the Governing Council to determine the terms and conditions for transfers of capital shares between the NCBs that are part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) on 30 April 2004 in order to ensure that the distribution of these shares corresponds to the adjustments made.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector (2), provides that the export refund on 100 kilograms of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 is equal to the basic amount multiplied by the sucrose content, including, where appropriate, other sugars expressed as sucrose; the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(3) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry (3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.
(4) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.
(5) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.
(6) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702 30 91 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.
(7) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(9) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.
(10) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.

the sucrose content of the product in question is determined in accordance with Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n\n((3)) Article 30(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the basic amount of the refund on sorbose exported in the natural state must be equal to the basic amount of the refund less one hundredth of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3), to the products listed in the Annex to the last mentioned Regulation.\n\n((4)) According to the terms of Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the basic amount of the refund on the other products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation exported in the natural state must be equal to one-hundredth of an amount which takes account, on the one hand, of the difference between the intervention price for white sugar for the Community areas without deficit for the month for which the basic amount is fixed and quotations or prices for white sugar on the world market and, on the other, of the need to establish a balance between the use of Community basic products in the manufacture of processed goods for export to third countries and the use of third country products brought in under inward-processing arrangements.\n\n((5)) According to the terms of Article 30(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, the application of the basic amount may be limited to some of the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of the said Regulation.\n\n((6)) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 makes provision for setting refunds for export in the natural state of products referred to in Article 1(1)(f) and (g) and (h) of that Regulation; the refund must be fixed per 100 kilograms of dry matter, taking account of the export refund for products falling within CN code 1702\xa030\xa091 and for products referred to in Article 1(1)(d) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and of the economic aspects of the intended exports; in the case of the products referred to in the said Article (1)(f) and (g), the refund is to be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95; for the products referred to in Article 1(1)(h), the refund shall be granted only for products complying with the conditions in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n\n((7)) The abovementioned refunds must be fixed every month; they may be altered in the intervening period.\n\n((8)) The first subparagraph of Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that refunds on the products referred to in Article 1 of that Regulation may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.\n\n((9)) The significant and rapid increase in preferential imports of sugar from the western Balkan countries since the start of 2001 and in exports of sugar to those countries from the Community seems to be highly artificial in nature.\n\n((10)) In order to prevent any abuses associated with the reimportation into the Community of sugar sector products that have qualified for export refunds, refunds for the products covered by this Regulation should not be fixed for all the countries of the western Balkans.\n\n((11)) In view of the above, refunds for the products in question should be fixed at the appropriate amounts.\n\n((12)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1(1)(d), (f), (g) and (h) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the natural state, shall be set out in the Annex hereto to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 October 2004.'}], 'annexes': [{'id': 'anx_1', 'type': 'annex', 'title': 'ANNEX', 'text': 'ANNEX\nEXPORT REFUNDS ON SYRUPS AND CERTAIN OTHER SUGAR PRODUCTS EXPORTED WITHOUT FURTHER PROCESSING APPLICABLE FROM 1 OCTOBER 2004\nProduct code\nDestination\nUnit of measurement\nAmount of refund\n1702\xa040\xa010\xa091\xa000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n42,28\n(\n1\n)\n1702\xa060\xa010\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n42,28\n(\n1\n)\n1702\xa060\xa080\xa091\xa000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n80,32\n(\n2\n)\n1702\xa060\xa095\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,4228\n(\n3\n)\n1702\xa090\xa030\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n42,28\n(\n1\n)\n1702\xa090\xa060\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,4228\n(\n3\n)\n1702\xa090\xa071\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,4228\n(\n3\n)\n1702\xa090\xa099\xa099\xa000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,4228\n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\n2106\xa090\xa030\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/100\xa0kg dry matter\n42,28\n(\n1\n)\n2106\xa090\xa059\xa090\xa000\nS00\nEUR/1\xa0% sucrose × net 100\xa0kg of product\n0,4228\n(\n3\n)\nNB\n: The product codes and the ‘A’ series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (\nOJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1\n).\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2081/2003 (\nOJ L 313, 28.11.2003, p. 11\n).\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\nS00\n:\nall destinations (third countries, other territories, victualling and destinations treated as exports from the Community) with the exception of Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro (including Kosovo as defined by the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, except for sugar incorporated into the products referred to in Article 1(2)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/96 (\nOJ L 297, 21.11.1996, p. 29\n).\n(\n1\n)\nApplicable only to products referred to in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n(\n2\n)\nApplicable only to products referred to in Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 2135/95.\n(\n3\n)\nThe basic amount is not applicable to syrups which are less than 85 % pure (Regulation (EC) No 2135/95).
