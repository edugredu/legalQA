THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emissions performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the Community's integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles (1), and in particular Article 12(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The supplier Webasto Roof & Components SE (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of the battery charging Webasto solar roof as an innovative technology on 5 March 2014. The application was found to be complete and the period for the Commission's assessment of the application started on the day following the date of official receipt, i.e. 6 March 2014.
(2) The application has been assessed in accordance with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 (2) and the Technical Guidelines for the preparation of applications for the approval of innovative technologies pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 (the Technical Guidelines) (3).
(3) The application refers to the battery charging Webasto solar roof. The solar roof consists of a photovoltaic (PV) panel which is installed on the vehicle roof. The photovoltaic panel converts ambient energy into electrical energy which, via a DC-DC-converter, is stored in an on-board battery. The Commission finds that the information provided in the application demonstrates that the conditions and criteria referred to in Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and in Articles 2 and 4 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011 have been met.
(4) The Applicant has demonstrated that a battery charging solar roof system of the kind described in this application did not exceed 3 % of the new passenger cars registered in the reference year 2009.
(5) In order to determine the CO2 savings that the innovative technology will deliver when fitted to a vehicle, it is necessary to define the baseline vehicle against which the efficiency of the vehicle equipped with the innovative technology should be compared as provided for in Articles 5 and 8 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011. The Commission finds that the baseline vehicle should be a vehicle variant that in all aspects is identical to the eco-innovation vehicle with the exception of the solar roof and, where applicable, without the additional battery and other appliances needed specifically for the conversion of the solar energy into electricity and its storage. For a new version of a vehicle in which the solar roof panel is installed the baseline vehicle should be the vehicle in which the solar roof panel is disconnected and the change in mass due to the installation of the solar roof is taken into account.
(6) The Applicant has provided a methodology for testing the CO2 reductions which includes formulae which are based on the Technical Guidelines with regard to a battery charging solar roof. The Commission considers that it should moreover be demonstrated the degree to which the overall energy consumption of the vehicle with regard to its transport function is improved compared to the energy consumed for the operation of devices aimed at enhancing the comfort of the driver or the passengers.
(7) In determining the savings it is also necessary to take into account the storage capacity of a single on-board battery or the presence of an additional battery dedicated for only storing the electricity generated by the solar roof
(8) The Commission finds that the testing methodology will provide testing results that are verifiable, repeatable and comparable and that it is capable of demonstrating in a realistic manner the CO2 emissions benefits of the innovative technology with strong statistical significance in accordance with Article 6 of Implementing Regulation (EU) No 725/2011.
(9) Against that background the Commission finds that the Applicant has demonstrated satisfactorily that the emission reduction achieved by the innovative technology is at least 1 g CO2/km.
(10) Since the CO2 emissions type-approval test referred to in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 692/2008 (5) does not take into consideration the presence of a solar roof and the additional energy provided through this technology, the Commission is satisfied that the battery charged Webasto solar roof is not covered by the standard test cycle. The Commission finds that the verification report has been prepared by the TÜV SÜD Czech s.r.o. which is an independent and certified body and that the report supports the findings set out in the application.
(11) Against that background, the Commission finds that no objections should be raised as regards the approval of the innovative technology in question.
(12) For the purposes of determining the general eco-innovation code to be used in the relevant type-approval documents in accordance with Annexes I, VIII and IX to Directive 2007/46/EC, the individual code to be used for the innovative technology approved through this Implementing Decision should be specified,","{'header': '19.11.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 332/34', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 18 November 2014\non the approval of the battery charging Webasto solar roof as an innovative technology for reducing CO2emissions from passenger cars pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2014/806/EU)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The supplier Webasto Roof & Components SE (the ‘Applicant’) submitted an application for the approval of the battery charging Webasto solar roof as an innovative technology on 5 March 2014.

amending Regulation (EC) No 176/2000 amending Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems originating in Japan
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’),
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) The Council, by Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 (2), imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of television camera systems (‘TCS’) originating in Japan. The Council subsequently confirmed the definitive anti-dumping duty by Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 (3), in accordance with Article 11(2) of the basic Regulation.
(2) In Article 1(3)(e) of Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 and Regulation (EC) No 2042/2000 (‘the definitive Regulations’), the Council specifically excluded from the scope of the anti-dumping duty camera systems which are listed in the Annex to the definitive Regulations (‘the Annex’), representing high-end professional camera systems technically falling within the product definition under Article 1(2) of the definitive Regulations, but which cannot be regarded as television camera systems.
(3) One exporting producer, namely Ikegami Tsushinki Co. Ltd. (‘Ikegami’), requested by letter, received by the Commission on 15 April 1999, to add certain new models of professional camera systems including their accessories to the Annex and thus to exempt them from the scope of the anti-dumping duties. In January 2000, the Council by Regulation (EC) No 176/2000 (4) (the ‘amending Regulation’) granted this request and amended Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 accordingly. In accordance with Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 176/2000, this amendment entered into force the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities, i.e. 28 January 2000.
B.   PRESENT EXAMINATION
(4) The Community Institutions received information that it would be appropriate to apply the amending Regulation, in so far as it amended the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 retroactively.
(5) Indeed, one exporting producer, namely Ikegami had to pay the definitive anti-dumping duty for all exports of its professional camera systems subject to the amending Regulation but made prior to the date of entry into force of this Regulation, i.e. prior to 28 January 2000, although these models have subsequently been exempted from the duty in accordance with Article 1(3)(e) of the definitive Regulations.
(6) In this context, the exporting producer concerned referred also to the prior practice of the Community Institutions, according to which an amendment of the Annex was generally applied retroactively to the date of the request whenever appropriate. Therefore, the exporting producer concerned claimed that the amendment of the Annex pursuant to the amending Regulation should be applied from the date of receipt by the Commission of the relevant request for exemption from the definitive duty, i.e. 15 April 1999 in accordance with the consistent practice of the Community Institutions.
(7) The Commission examined whether the retroactive application of the amending Regulation would indeed be appropriate. In this respect it was first considered that all professional camera models mentioned in recital (5) have indeed been qualified as professional camera systems. In accordance with Article 1(3)(e) of the definitive Regulations these cameras are exempted from the definitive anti-dumping duty by virtue of their inclusion in the Annex.
(8) It is noted that a professional camera system falling within Article 1(3)(e) of the definitive Regulations is exempted, from the date it has been explicitly included in the Annex by way of amending the definitive Regulations, from the definitive duty. In this context, it is assumed that exporting producers know in advance, i.e. prior to any first exportation into the Community, their cycles of production and whether their new models should qualify as professional cameras within the meaning of Article 1(3)(e), and consequently whether they should be included in the Annex and an application to that effect be made.
(9) Notwithstanding the above, it was not in the Community Institutions' intention that the definitive anti-dumping duty be applicable to imports of professional camera systems which are eventually found to be exemptible from this duty by the application of Article 1(3)(e). Therefore, where appropriate, the necessity for a retroactive application of a Regulation exempting certain professional camera models has been recognised from the date of the receipt of such a request, which allowed the Community institutions to properly monitor the accuracy of the classifications. This was the case, in particular, where professional camera models have been imported in the Community prior to the entering into force of the Regulation amending the Annex but after the date of the exemption request.
(10) In the present case, it was shown that Ikegami imported certain professional camera systems, prior to the publication of the amending Regulation, but after it lodged its exemption request, which have subsequently been exempted by the application of Article 1(3)(e) of the definitive Regulations. The amending Regulation entered into force the day after its publication, i.e. on 28 January 2000. However, as mentioned above, it has not been in the Community Institutions' intention that the definitive anti-dumping duties apply to camera systems which are found to be exemptible after a request has been lodged to that effect with the Commission. In fact, the Commission, immediately after the imposition of the definitive measures and the creation of the first Annex in 1994, actually informed the exporting producers concerned that it is intended to reimburse definitive anti-dumping duties paid for imports of professional camera systems eventually found to be falling under Article 1(3)(e) between a fully documented request for exemption and the corresponding publication of the amended Annex. In this context, it was considered that the retroactive application of the amending Regulation, in so far as it amended the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1015/94 would bring the current situation in line with the consistent practice of the Community Institutions.
(11) The Community industry and Ikegami were informed accordingly and granted a time period to comment on the Commission services determination. None of the interested parties objected to the above conclusions.
C.   CONCLUSION
(12) Considering the above, the Community Institutions concluded that the retroactive application of the Annex as amended by the amending Regulation is warranted.
(13) Given the above the Annex as amended by Regulation (EC) No 176/2000 should apply to imports of the following professional camera models produced and exported to the European Community by Ikegami from the date of receipt by the Commission of the relevant request for exemption from the definitive anti-dumping duty for these models, i.e. 15 April 1999:
— camera head HC-400
— camera head HC-400W
— viewfinder VF15-46

COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 1359/2011
of 19 December 2011
amending Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 31 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 (1). Products within those tariff quotas can be imported at reduced or zero duty rates. For the same reasons it is necessary to open, with effect from 1 January 2012, new tariff quotas at a zero duty rate for an appropriate volume for the products with order numbers 09.2928 and 09.2929, by inserting those products in the list in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.
(2) The quota volumes for autonomous tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2624 and 09.2640 are insufficient to meet the needs of the industry of the Union for the current quota period ending on 31 December 2011. Consequently, those quota volumes should be increased with effect from 1 July 2011.
(3) The quota volumes for autonomous tariff quotas with order numbers 09.2603, 09.2629, 09.2632, 09.2816 and 09.2977 should be replaced by the volumes set out in the Annex to this Regulation.
(4) It is no longer in the interest of the Union to continue to grant tariff quotas in 2012 for the products with order numbers 09.2815, 09.2841 and 09.2992, for which such quotas were established for 2011. Those quotas should therefore be closed with effect from 1 January 2012 and the corresponding products should be deleted from the list in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010.
(5) In view of the many changes to be made, the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should be replaced in its entirety in the interest of clarity.
(6) Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Since the tariff quotas have to take effect from 1 January 2012, this Regulation should apply from the same date and enter into force immediately,","{'header': '22.12.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 341/11', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 1359/2011\nof 19 December 2011\namending Regulation (EU) No 7/2010 opening and providing for the management of autonomous tariff quotas of the Union for certain agricultural and industrial products', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In order to ensure sufficient and uninterrupted supplies of certain goods insufficiently produced in the Union and to avoid any disturbances on the market for certain agricultural and industrial products, autonomous tariff quotas have been opened by Council Regulation (EU) No 7/2010(1).

","COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1431/76  of 21 June 1976  laying down general rules for granting export refunds on rice and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 of 21 June 1976 on the common organization of the market in rice (1), and in particular Article 17 (5) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas export refunds on products subject to the common organization of the market in rice must be fixed in accordance with certain criteria which would make it possible to cover the difference between quotations and prices for those products within the Community and on the world market, while respecting the general aims of the common organization ; whereas to this end the supply situation within the Community and the price situation on the world market and within the Community for rice and broken rice must be taken into account;
Whereas, in view of the considerable fluctuations over periods of time in quotations for rice and broken rice on the world market and the disparity between the prices at which these products are offered by various countries on that market, a refund should be fixed which, for the purpose of covering the difference between world prices and prices ruling within the Community, particularly in view of costs incurred in placing these products on the market, would take the difference between representative prices within the Community and the most favourable quotations on the world market into account;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 17 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 the refund is to vary according to the destination of the products, the amount of such variations should be determined on the basis of the distances separating the Community market from the countries of destination or on the basis of the special conditions which apply to imports in certain of these countries;
Whereas, to avoid distortions of competition between Community traders, the administrative conditions under which they operate must be identical throughout the Community;
Whereas, to ensure Community traders sufficient stability in the amount of the refund, the period for which the amounts may remain unchanged should be fixed at one month, subject to any alterations which may be made in the intervening period pursuant to the second sentence of the fourth subparagraph of Article 17 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76;
Whereas, in certain situations, and in particular in periods of uncertainty or of considerable price fluctuations on the world market, exports should be regulated by means of a quantitative limitation on refunds ; whereas fixing the refund by a tendering procedure seems to be a suitable means of attaining that objective ; whereas the adjustment, by reference to threshold prices, of a refund fixed in advance for paddy rice or semi-milled rice may be made only by applying the rates used to convert values relating to a quantity of husked or wholly milled rice into a value relating to the same quantity of rice at another stage of processing ; whereas the general rules on the granting of refunds should consequently be set out in detail, in order to prevent wrongful application of Article 17 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 involving the omission of those conversion rates;
Whereas there does not appear to be any justification for granting a refund on paddy rice or husked rice imported from third countries and re-exported to third countries unless certain conditions are fulfilled,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1431/76 of 21 June 1976 laying down general rules for granting export refunds on rice and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThis Regulation lays down rules for fixing and granting export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas an Agreement between the European Economic Community and Spain (1) was concluded on 29 June 1970 and supplemented by the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Spain consequent on the accession of the Hellenic Republic to the Community (2);
Whereas the Community committed itself, under this Agreement, to opening an annual total Community tariff quota of 1 424 000 tonnes of certain petroleum products falling within Chapter 27 of the Common Customs Tariff and refined in Spain; whereas the quota duty is equal to 40 % of the Common Customs Tariff duties; whereas this Community tariff quota should be opened for 1985;
Whereas it is in particular necessary to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the abovementioned quota and uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the product concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, having regard to the above principles, the Community nature of the quota can be respected by allocating the Community tariff quota among the Member States; whereas, to reflect as accurately as possible the true trend of the market of the products in question, such allocation should be in proportion to the requirements of the Member States, calculated by reference to the statistics for imports from Spain over a representative period and also to the economic outlook for the quota period concerned;
Whereas, in respect of the last three years for which statistics are available, the corresponding imports by each of the Member States represent the following percentages of the imports into the Community from Spain of the products concerned:
1.2.3.4 //   //   //   //   // Member State  // 1981  // 1982  // 1983  //   //   //   //   // Benelux  // 26,9  // 12,4  // 4,1  // Denmark  // -  // 2,5  // -  // Germany  // 9,8  // 2,6  // 1,1  // Greece  // -  // -  // 0,3  // France  // 12,2  // 7,2  // 57,5  // Ireland  // 6,1  // -  // -  // Italy  // 13,6  // 18,7  // 8,7  // United Kingdom  // 31,4  // 56,6  // 28,3  //   //   //   //
Whereas, in view of these factors, and of market forecasts for the products concerned and in particular of the estimates submitted by certain Member States, initial quota shares may be fixed approximately at the following percentages:
Benelux 7,3
Denmark 12.2
Germany 4,9
Greece 0,2
France 36,5
Ireland 7,3
Italy 7,3
United Kingdom 24,3
Whereas, in order to take into account import trends for the products concerned in the various Member States, the quota volume should be divided into two instalments, the first being shared between the Member States and the second constituting a reserve to cover at a later date the requirements of Member States which have used up their initial quota shares; whereas,
to give importers in each Member State a certain degree of security, the first instalment of the Community quota might under the present circumstances be fixed at about 30 % of the quota;
Whereas the Member States' initial shares may be used up at different times; whereas, in order to take this fact into account and avoid any break in continuity, any Member State which has almost used up its initial quota share should draw an additional share from the reserve; whereas this must be done by each Member State as and when each of its additional shares is almost used up, and repeated as many times as the reserve allows; whereas the initial and additional shares must be valid until the end of the quota period; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must be in a position to monitor the extent to which the quota volume has been used up and to inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas if, at a given date in the quota period, a substantial quantity of an initial share remains unused in any Member State, it is essential that that Member State should return a significant proportion to the reserve, to prevent a part of any Community tariff quota from remaining unused in one Member State when it could be used in others;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, any operation relating to the administration of the quota shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any of its members,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 3316/84 of 22 November 1984 opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for certain petroleum products falling within Chapter 27 of the Common Customs Tariff and refined in Spain (1985)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom 1 January to 31 December 1985, and subject to the measures which might be taken pursuant to Article 3 (2) and (4) of Annex I to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and Spain, the Common Customs Tariff duties in respect of the products refined in Spain and listed below shall be suspended partially at the levels indicated for each of them, within the limits of a global Community tariff quota of 1 424 000 tonnes:\n\n1.2.3 //   //   //   // CCT heading No  // Description  // Rate of duty (%)  //   //   //   //   //   //   // 27.10  // Petroleum oils and oils obtained from bituminous minerals, other than crude; preparations not elsewhere specified or included, containing not less than 70 % by weight of petroleum oils or of oils obtained from bituminous minerals, these oils being the basic constituents of the preparations:  //   //  // A.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 21 February 1986
accepting undertakings given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of fibre building board from Finland and Sweden and terminating the investigation
(86/35/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
After consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas,
A. Procedure
1. On 9 January 1985, the Commission reopened the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of fibre building board of wood originating in Finland and Sweden (2), because of the changes in the corporate structures of the exporting companies concerned as set out in the Commission's notice of reopening. The product concerned is fibrebuilding board, with the exception of medium board, falling within heading No ex 44.11 of the Common Customs Tariff and corresponding to NIMEXE code 44.11-10, 20, 91 and 99.
2. The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainant and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
Some Community producers, the exporters concerned and some importers made their views known in writing. In addition, the Swedish exporter and the legal successor of two of the Finnish exporters concerned requested, and were granted, a hearing.
3. The Commission sought and verified all information it considered necessary and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
EEC producers:
- GUTEX, H. Henselmann, GmbH & Co, Waldshut-Tiengen, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Hornitex Werke, Horn-Bad Meinberg, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Odenwald Faserplattenwerk GmbH, Amorbach, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Renitex GmbH, Losheim/Saar, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Isoroy SA, Lisieux, France,
- Unalit SA, Saint-Jean-de-Losne, France,
- Legnochimica SpA, MondovĂ­, Italy,
- Orsa SpA, MondovĂ­, Italy.
Exporters:
- Ahlstroem, Oy, Pihlava, Finland,
- Enso-Gutzeit Oy, Heinola, Finland,
- Suomen Kuitulevy Oy, Heinola, Finland,
- Wilh. Schauman Oy, Helsinki, Finland,
- Karlit AB, Karlholmsbruk, Sweden.
Importers:
- Wekapal GmbH, Bad Salzuflen Federal Republic of Germany.
The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January to 31 December 1984.
B. Normal value
4. (a) Sweden
The investigation to determine the existence of dumping has shown that the prices of hardboard, the only kind of fibre building board produced and exported by Karlit AB, sold by that company on its domestic market had, over an extended period of time and in respect of substantial quantities, been lower than the the cost of production. The normal value was therefore determined on the basis of the constructed value. To determine the constructed value, the Commission added the cost of production, including a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses, and a reasonable margin of profit.
(b) Finland
For all Finnish exporters. normal values for both kinds of fibre building board here concerned, i.e. hardboard and insulating board, were established on the basis of domestic prices actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for the like product, since these prices were shown to be profitable.
C. Export price
5. Export prices for all exporters concerned were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
6. The export prices of Karlit AB to the German importer and processor of hardboard which was associated with Karlit AB as of 1 January 1985 did not have to be constructed since the association did not yet exist during the investigation period. Nevertheless, the Commission sought and verified all relevant costs and prices of that importer in view of a possible renewed offer of an undertaking by Karlit AB which, in its terms, would have to take account of such association.
D. Comparison
7. In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability, in particular quantity discounts and rebates, as well as conditions and terms of sale such as credit terms, transport, insurance, handling and salesman's salaries. Due allowance for such differences was made where claims in these areas could be satisfactorily demonstrated.
All comparisons were made at ex-works level and for each individual transaction.
E. Margins
8. The above examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of all exporters involved, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
9. These margins vary according to the exporter, the importing Member State and the type of fibre building board concerned, the weighted average margin for each of the exporters investigated being as follows:
Finland:
1.2 // - Ahlstroem Oy:   // 16,78 % for hardboard; 26,62 % for softboard   // - Enso-Gutzeit Oy:   // 11,5 % for hardboard; 12,12 % for softboard   // - Wilh. Schauman Oy:   // 11,14 % for hardboard; no exports of softboard   // Sweden:   //   // - Karlit AB:   // 5,4 % for hardboard, no exports of softboard
F. Injury
10. In 1982, after having carried out anti-dumping investigations concerning imports of fibre building board from various countries, the Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1633/82 (1) established that dumped imports of fibre building board, including dumped imports from Finland and Sweden, had caused injury to the Community industry concerned and that protective measures were necessary. Consequently, the Commission accepted the undertakings eliminating the injury which were offered by the exporters concerned in the present investigation.
11. While these undertakings have improved the position of the Community fibre building board industry, the situation of this industry is far from being satisfactory. It is still characterized by low capacity utilization, reduced profits and high import penetration. Consequently, the production of hardboard by the Community industry has declined from 520 200 tonnes in 1982 to 465 500 tonnes in 1984, with sales of this industry in the Community decreasing from 412 400 tonnes to 403 800 tonnes over the same period.
12. At the same time, the consumption of hardboard remained relatively stable so that there was a further decrease of the market share held by Community producers within the Community. Furthermore, three Community producers of fibre building board were forced to cease production since 1982 which resulted in a further loss of employment.
13. On the other hand, imports of hardboard from Finland into the Community went up from 38 146 tonnes in 1982 to 42 990 tonnes in 1984 which represents an increase in market share from 4,3 % to 4,8 %. Imports of that product from Sweden into the Community, in spite of decreasing from 118 337 tonnes in 1982 to 112 449 tonnes in 1984, only suffered a minor reduction in market share from 13,3 % to 12,6 % over that period.
14. There is no indication, therefore, that in the absence of protective measures, dumped imports of fibre building board from Finland and Sweden would not again cause material injury to the Community industry.
G. Community interest
15. In view of the serious difficulties still facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken, except in the case of Wilh. Schauman Oy, Helsinki, which ceased to produce and export hardboard at the end of 1985.
H. Undertakings
16. The exporters concerned were informed of the main findings of the investigation and commented on them. Undertakings were subsequently offered by Karlit AB, Sweden, concerning their exports of hardboard to the Commuity, and by Suomen Kuitulevy Oy, the legal successor of the fibre building board divisions of Ahlstroem Oy, Pihlava and Enso-Gutzeit Oy, Heinola, concerning their exports of fibre building board to the Community.
17. The effects of the said undertakings will be to ensure that export prices to the Community will be at a level sufficient to eliminate injury to the Community industry. Insofar as price increases are foreseen in these undertakings they, in no case, exceed the dumping margins found in the investigation. Moreover, it appears that correct operation of these undertakings can be effectively monitored, in particular since the Commission during its investigation did not observe any violations of the undertakings previously in force.
18. In these circumstances the undertakings offered are considered acceptable and the investigation may, therefore, be terminated without the imposition of anti-dumping duties.
19. No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee.","{'title': '86/35/EEC: Commission Decision of 21 February 1986 accepting undertakings given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of fibre building board from Finland and Sweden and terminating the investigation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertakings given by Suomen Kuitulevy Oy, Heinola, and Karlit AB, Karlholmsbruk, in connection with the anti-dumping investigation concerning imports of fibre building board, with the exception of medium board, falling within Common Customs Tariff heading ex 44.11, corresponding to NIMEXE codes 44.11-10, 20, 91 and 99 originating in Finland and Sweden, are hereby accepted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe anti-dumping investigation referred to in Article 1 is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 21 February 1986.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nWilly DE CLERCQ\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 201, 30. 7. 1984, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No C 6, 9. 1. 1985, p. 4.\n\n(1) OJ No L 181, 25. 6. 1982, p. 19.'}]}"

on an aid granted in France to cereal farmers and producers, financed by the reimbursement of specific fiscal and parafiscal charges

(90/197/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 93 (2) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 21 thereof,

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2777/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in poultrymeat (5), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1235/89 (6), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Having given notice to the parties concerned, in accordance with Article 93 (2) of the Treaty, to submit their comments (7),
Whereas:
I
Following a complaint, the Commission learned of a system under which French livestock farmers who also grow cereals can obtain the reimbursement of specific fiscal charges (solidarity contributions, Bapsa (supplementary budget for agricultural social benefits) contributions) paid on the delivery of cereals to a recognized collector (amending financial law for 1982 of 30 December 1982); whereas two decrees of 26 October 1983 extended the arrangements to cover parafiscal charges (FASC and FNDA (National Agricultural Development Fund) contributions).
The system allows French livestock farmers who also grow cereals to obtain the reimbursement of the charges paid on a quantity of cereals, not exceeding 300 tonnes par marketing year, corresponding to the amount of products of the same type contained in feedingstuffs purchased for their holding.
II
1. By letter of 29 November 1988 addressed to the French Government the Commission stated that it had decided, in regard to the aid, to initiate the procedure provided of in Article 93 (2) of the EEC Treaty.
2. In that letter the Commission informed the French authorities that it considered the aid to be an operating aid with no lasting effect on the development of the sector concerned, the effects of which would disappear with the measure itself. The Commission considers such measures to be as a matter of principle incompatible with the common market.
There is in any case already a complete and exhaustive set of Community rules for the livestock sectors that debars the Member States from additional action to support producers' incomes.
This aid is therefore an infringement of the Community provisions in question.
3. Under the procedure the Commission gave notice to the French Government to submit its comments.
The Commission also gave the other Member States and other interested parties notice to submit their comments.
III
By letter of 1 March 1989 the French Government replied to the Commission's letter of notice.
According to the French authorities the system does not provide an aid but merely livestock/cereal farmers who do not have the necessary processing equipment from being treated differently from those who process their own crops and so do not pay the charges levied on the marketing of cereals, and so affords equality of treatment to all French livestock/cereal farmers.
These authorities consider that the system is covered by the Court of Justice's finding on respect for the general principle of equality, as for instance in Case 300/86 (1).
Moreover they consider that the position of livestock farmers who grow cereals cannot be compared with that of livestock farmers not growing cereals.
These points were argued and developed by the French authorities at a meeting with the Commission on 25 April 1989.
IV
The following points must be made in response to the arguments advanced by the French authorities:
- the reimbursement of these charges to livestock/cereal producers must be considered aid granted through State resources as mentioned in Article 92 of the EEC Treaty, the Court having found that 'a measure adopted by the public authority and favouring certain undertakings or products so as not lose the character of a gratuitous advantage by the fact that it is wholly or partially financed by contributions imposed by the public authority and levied on the undertakings concerned' (1);
- whilst it is true that in Case 300/86 the Court of Justice invalidated the second subparagraph of Article 1 (2) of Commission Regulation No 2040/80 (2), as amended by Commission Regulation No 2512/86 (3), 'in so far as it exempts from the co-responsibility levy the first-stage processing of cereals carried out on the producer's own agricultural holding by means of the machinery of the farm, provided that the products of the processing are used on that holding, but does not provide for such exemption for first-stage processing carried out off the producer's agricultural holding or by means of machinery which does not form part of the agricultural installations of the farm, where the products of the processing are used on that farm', the principle does not apply to the case in hand since a Community arrangement for exemption under certain conditions from a charge of compulsory and uniform application throughout the Community cannot properly be compared with a national arrangement for reimbursement of national charges in a Member State. Moreover, the purpose of the Community rules on the co-responsibility leby is to restrict structural surpluses of cereals on the market, which is not the case with the French measure;
- lastly, livestock/cereal farmers and livestock farmers not producing cereals are in competition as regards the products of stockfarming.
Given the foregoing the arguments put forward by the French authorities cannot be accepted.
V
1. Articles 92, 93 and 94 of the EEC Treaty apply to the production and marketing of the products covered by the aid in question, under the terms of the various common organizations of markets mentioned above.
The aid affords a specific advantage to certain French livestock farmers who also grow cereals, viz. a reduction in their livestock production costs. The significant proportion (50 to 70 %) of the selling price of meat accounted for by feed costs should be noted. In consequence competition between these farmers and others, in both France and the other Member States, who do not receive the reimbursement is distorted.
By its nature the measure is, since it reduces production costs and relates to products in which there is substantial trade, liable to affect intra-Community trade. The figures (in thousands of tonnes) for trade in the products in question between France and the other countries of the Community in 1987 may be summarized as follows:
(in thousand tonnes)
1.2.3.4 //  //  //  //  //  // Imports from EEC   // Export from EEC   // Self-sufficiency   //    //   //   //  // Beef/veal   // 294   // 209   // 121,24 %   //    //   //  //   // Pigmeat   // 424   // 97   // 81 %   //    //   //  //   // Poultrymeat   // 40   // 138   // 136,57 %   //    //  //   //
Because of the measure operators in other Member States see their exports curbed since merchants have a wider offer of animals of French origin as a result of the granting of the aid, and, moreover, the quantities offered for export are increased.
The aid therefore satisfies the criteria of Article 92 (1) of the EEC Treaty and is therefore incompatible with the common market.
2. The exceptions to such incompatibility set out in Article 92 (2) are clearly not applicable to the aid in question, nor have they been invoked by the French authorities. Those set out in Article 92 (3) relate to objectives pursued in the Community's interest and not only in the interest of individual sectors of the national economy. These exceptions are to be strictly interpreted when examining any regional or sectoral aid or any case of individual application of general aid schemes.
Exceptions can be granted only in cases where the Commission can establish that the aid is necessary for achievement of one of the objectives set out in these provisions. To allow such exceptions in resepct of aid which does not offer such guarantees would amount ot allowing trade between Member States to be affected and comeptition to be distorted without justification from the point of view of the Community interest and would give an unfair advantage to certain Member States.
In the case in point, the aid does not offer such guarantees. The French Government was unable to provide any justification, and the Commission could find none, showing that the aid in question met the conditions required for the application of one of the exceptions set out in Article 92 (3) of the Treaty.
This is not a measure intended to promote a project of common European interest as mentioned in Article 92 (3) (b) nor a measure intended to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the Member State in question, as also mentined in that provision.
As far as the derogations provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) in the case of aid to promote or facilitate the economic development of areas or to facilitate the development of certain activities mentioned in the said point (c) are concerned, it should be noted that the aid cannot durably improve the conditions pertaining in the economic sector in which it is granted.
By possibly bringing about an increase in deliveries of meat to intervention, the aid may also bring about an increase in European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund expenditure. On that account it must be considered as against the common interest.
In consequence, the aid is to be considered as an operational aid, a type which the Commission has always opposed as a matter of principle since the terms of such aid do not bring it within the scope of one of the exceptions provided for in Article 92 (3) (a) and (c) of the Treaty.
3. In the case of livestock products the market in which is subject to a common organization there are restrictions of the right of Member States to intervene directly in the operation of those organizations with a common price structure, which fall within the exclusive competence of the Community.
The granting of aid of this type ignores the principle that Member States no longer have the right to act independently in the matter of farmers' incomes within the framework of a common organization of the market by the granting of such aid.
Even if it had been possible to envisage an exception under Article 92 (3) of the Treaty, the fact that the aid infringes the common organizations of the markets in question makes it impossible to apply any such exception.
4. In consequence, the aid is incompatible with the common market within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty and may no longer be granted,","{'title': '90/197/EEC: Commission Decision of 4 October 1989 on an aid granted in France to cereal farmers and producers, financed by the reimbursement of specific fiscal and parafiscal charges (Only the French text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe French Government shall discontinue the aid to livestock farmers who also grow cereals in the form of reimbursement of specific fiscal and parafiscal charges paid on a quantity of cereals, not exceeding 300 tonnes per marketing year, corresponding to the amount of products of the same type contained in feedingstuffs purchased for their holding.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe French Government shall inform the Commission, within two months from notification of this Decision, of the measures it has taken to comply with this Decision.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 4 October 1989.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nRay MAC SHARRY\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No L 129, 11. 5. 1989, p. 12.\n\n(3) OJ No L 148, 28. 6. 1968, p. 24.\n\n(4) OJ No L 61, 4. 3. 1989, p. 43.\n\n(5) OJ No L 282, 1. 11. 1975, p. 77.\n\n(6) OJ No L 128, 11. 5. 1989, p. 29.\n\n(7) OJ No C 35, 11. 2. 1989, p. 17.\n\n(1) Landschoot v.

Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Articles 24 and 38 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Member States of the European Union cooperate in criminal matters with the United States of America on the basis of bilateral agreements, conventions, treaties, national law and arrangements.
(2) The European Union is determined to improve this cooperation in order to be able to combat, in particular, transnational crime and terrorism in a more effective way.
(3) The Council decided on 26 April 2002 to authorise the Presidency, assisted by the Commission, to enter into negotiations with the United States of America, and the Presidency negotiated two Agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters, one on mutual legal assistance and one on extradition, with the United States of America.
(4) The Agreements should be signed on behalf of the European Union, subject to their subsequent conclusion. The European Union will, at the time of the signature make the following declaration:
""The European Union states that it is in a process of development of an area of freedom, security and justice, which may have consequences that affect the Agreements with the United States. These developments will be considered carefully by the Union in particular as regards Article 10(2) of the Extradition Agreement. The Union will wish to consult with the United States in order to find solutions to any developments affecting the Agreements, including, if needed, through revision of the Agreements. The Union states that Article 10 does not constitute a precedent for negotiations with third states.""
(5) The Agreements foresee in their Article 3(2) that written instruments be exchanged between the United States of America and the Member States of the Union on the application of bilateral treaties. Article 3(3) of the Agreement on mutual legal assistance provides a similar obligation for those Member States that do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States.

of 3 January 2003
fixing the export refunds on milk and milk products
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31 of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when the refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation, exported in the natural state, are being fixed, account must be taken of:
- the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of milk and milk products on the Community market and prices for milk and milk products in international trade,
- marketing costs and the most favourable transport charges from Community markets to ports or other points of export in the Community, as well as costs incurred in placing the goods on the market of the country of destination,
- the aims of the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products which are to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on this market,
- the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty, and
- the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market, and
- the economic aspect of the proposed exports.
(3) Article 31(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that when prices within the Community are being determined account should be taken of the ruling prices which are most favourable for exportation, and that when prices in international trade are being determined particular account should be taken of:
(a) prices ruling on third country markets;
(b) the most favourable prices in third countries of destination for third country imports;
(c) producer prices recorded in exporting third countries, account being taken, where appropriate, of subsidies granted by those countries; and
(d) free-at-Community-frontier offer prices.
(4) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund on the products listed in Article 1 of the abovementioned Regulation according to destination.
(5) Article 31(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the list of products on which export refunds are granted and the amount of such refunds should be fixed at least once every four weeks; the amount of the refund may, however, remain at the same level for more than four weeks.
(6) In accordance with Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 on specific detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds on milk and milk products(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2279/2002(4), the refund granted for milk products containing added sugar is equal to the sum of the two components; one is intended to take account of the quantity of milk products and is calculated by multiplying the basic amount by the milk products content in the product concerned; the other is intended to take account of the quantity of added sucrose and is calculated by multiplying the sucrose content of the entire product by the basic amount of the refund valid on the day of exportation for the products listed in Article 1(1)(d) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(5), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(6), however, this second component is applied only if the added sucrose has been produced using sugar beet or cane harvested in the Community.
(7) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 896/84(7), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 222/88(8), laid down additional provisions concerning the granting of refunds on the change from one milk year to another; those provisions provide for the possibility of varying refunds according to the date of manufacture of the products.
(8) For the calculation of the refund for processed cheese provision must be made where casein or caseinates are added for that quantity not to be taken into account.
(9) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in milk and in particular to quotations or prices for milk products within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal of the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
(1) Whereas the European Council meeting in Essen on 9 and 10 December 1994 defined the pre-accession strategy for the associated Central and Eastern Europe countries;
(2) Whereas the European Council in Cannes on 26 and 27 June 1995 agreed to supplement the budgetary assistance granted to the Mediterranean countries by an increase in European Investment Bank (EIB) loans to contribute to the creation of a free-trade area and to the Euro-Mediterranean partnership;
(3) Whereas the European Council meeting in Madrid on 15 and 16 December 1995 called on the Council and the Commission to implement the Declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and the work programme drawn up at the Barcelona Conference with the Mediterranean countries (Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia, Turkey, Gaza-West Bank); whereas, at the same meeting, the European Council confirmed the importance of the EIB's role as an instrument of cooperation between the Community and Latin America and called on the EIB to intensify its activities in the region; whereas the European Council also noted with respect to enlargement that the continued activities of the EIB will allow an overall increase in the input for accession preparations;
(4) Whereas the European Council meeting in Florence on 21 and 22 June 1996 welcomed the results of the Asia-Europe summit, which marked a turning-point in the relations between the two continents;
(5) Whereas the Central and Eastern Europe countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic and Slovenia) are undertaking major political and social reforms and have embarked on a fundamental restructuring of their economies;
(6) Whereas the EIB is completing the current loan programmes for Central and Eastern Europe countries pursuant to Decision 93/696/EC (3) and the lending that is governed by the IV Protocols and horizontal financial cooperation in the Mediterranean non-member countries as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 1763/92 (4);
(7) Whereas the EIB has already completed the three-year lending programme in Latin American and Asian countries pursuant to Decision 93/115/EEC (5); whereas a new interim programme pursuant to Decision 96/723/EC (6) will permit the EIB to continue its lending activities in those countries;
(8) Whereas the Council approved on 4 October 1994 a Cooperation Agreement between the Community and the Republic of South Africa that aims to promote harmonious, balanced and sustainable social and economic development; whereas the EIB will be completing in June 1997 the two-year lending programme in South Africa pursuant to Decision 95/207/EC (7);
(9) Whereas the Council calls on the EIB to continue its operations in support of investment projects carried out in the Central and Eastern Europe countries, Mediterranean countries, Latin American and Asian countries and South Africa;
(10) Whereas it is appropriate to effect certain improvements in the programmes of operations in respect of duration, instruments used and country coverage;
(11) Whereas the guarantee provided for in this Decision should be granted to the EIB;
(12) Whereas this guarantee is subject to the conditions set out in the Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2728/94 (8);
(13) Whereas, in June 1996, the Commission, in agreement with the EIB, presented to the Council a proposal for a new guarantee system for EIB lending to third countries;
(14) Whereas the Council on 2 December 1996 has approved conclusions on new guarantee arrangements for EIB lending to third countries, according to which: 'The volume of external lending shall respect the Financial Perspective and Community Budget discipline as well as the EIB internal guidelines on lending to third countries and take into account the conclusions of European Councils at Essen, Cannes and Madrid. The approach of a blanket guarantee, without distinguishing regions and projects, is approved. A risk sharing element as proposed by the Commission and the EIB is accepted. Accordingly, the EIB is invited where possible to secure, on a significant proportion of its lending, adequate third-party guarantees for commercial risks, with the Budgetary guarantee in that case being responsible only for political risks arising from currency non-transfer, expropriation, war and civil disturbance. The EIB is invited to aim at 25 % of its total lending under the mandates as a target for the use of non-sovereign guarantees to be expanded on wherever possible insofar as the market permits on an individual mandate basis. The application of the target to individual mandates is to be specified at the time of negotiation of those mandates.`;
(15) Whereas this Decision should conform to the above conclusions;
(16) Whereas a guarantee level of 70 % is sufficient to meet the total lending volume of the new lending mandates and other lending needs for the duration of this Decision;
(17) Whereas the new guarantee arrangements will not affect the excellent credit standing of the EIB;
(18) Whereas the Council concluded on 2 December 1996 that 'the provisioning rates of the Guarantee Fund will remain at the current levels up to 1999`; whereas the Council concluded on 27 January 1997 that 'each payment to the loan guarantee fund will be based on the percentage required at the time of payment, that is 15 % currently and 14 % as soon as feasible`;
(19) Whereas the Commission and the EIB recognizing their respective areas of responsibility should ensure appropriate coordination between EIB operations in the eligible third countries and the implementation of the Community's other financial instruments;
(20) Whereas the Commission and the EIB should consult together in order to ensure that, in determining the rate at which the mandates are used, account will be taken of the annual fluctuations in the rate at which the Community is being asked to provide balance of payments support to third countries;
(21) Whereas the Council has approved this Decision and in particular the amounts of the mandates taking into account its conclusions of 27 January 1997 according to which: 'Member States and the Commission unanimously declare that they agree to the creation of a substantial pre-accession support facility. They invite the EIB to propose such a facility to the Board of Governors later this year. The facility will enter into force as soon as possible in the light of future accession. The facility will be approved under Article 18 of the EIB statute and carry no guarantee from the Community budget or from the Member States. The EIB lending envelopes covered by a Community guarantee can be considered to be consistent with a provision of ECU 1 050 million for macro-financial assistance (MFA) assuming that ECU 750 million is needed for Euratom lending; whereas the maximum for MFA should be increased to ECU 1 200 million, if Euratom lending in the period of application of the present decision does not exceed ECU 600 million.`;

Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down the general animal health rules governing all stages of the production, processing and distribution of products of animal origin in the Union, including their introduction into the Union from third countries.
(2) Article 4 of Directive 2002/99/EC provides that Member States may authorise, subject to compliance with certain conditions, the production, processing and distribution of products of animal origin which come from a territory or part thereof subject to animal health restrictions. Annex III to that Directive sets out a table listing treatments that can be applied to products of animal origin in order to eliminate the animal health risks linked to meat and milk. Those treatments are in line with the treatments recommended in the relevant chapters of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE Terrestrial Code).
(3) In the Chapter on foot-and-mouth disease of the OIE Terrestrial Code, a treatment has been included which ensures the inactivation of the foot-and-mouth disease virus in meat.
(4) That treatment should therefore be included in the list of treatments in the Table set out in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC as effective to eliminate the risk of foot-and-mouth disease in meat.
(5) In addition, the reference to ‘sheep and goat plague’ in the Table set out in Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC should be replaced by ‘peste des petits ruminants’ in order to reflect the official denomination of that disease in the OIE Terrestrial Code. Furthermore, the number ‘1’ in the title of the table should be deleted and the mention ‘MEAT’ before the treatments for milk should be replaced by ‘MILK’.
(6) Annex III to Directive 2002/99/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '2.8.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 206/13', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 31 July 2013\namending Annex III to Council Directive 2002/99/EC laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption as regards the addition of a treatment to eliminate certain animal health risks in meat\n(notified under document C(2013) 4853)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2013/417/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2002/99/EC lays down the general animal health rules governing all stages of the production, processing and distribution of products of animal origin in the Union, including their introduction into the Union from third countries.\n\n((2)) Article 4 of Directive 2002/99/EC provides that Member States may authorise, subject to compliance with certain conditions, the production, processing and distribution of products of animal origin which come from a territory or part thereof subject to animal health restrictions.

Alternatively, an entity may receive cash from customers for the acquisition or construction of such items of property, plant and equipment. Typically, customers are required to pay additional amounts for the purchase of goods or services based on usage.\n2\nTransfers of assets from customers may also occur in industries other than utilities. For example, an entity outsourcing its information technology functions may transfer its existing items of property, plant and equipment to the outsourcing provider.\n3\nIn some cases, the transferor of the asset may not be the entity that will eventually have ongoing access to the supply of goods or services and will be the recipient of those goods or services. However, for convenience this Interpretation refers to the entity transferring the asset as the customer.\nSCOPE\n4\nThis Interpretation applies to the accounting for transfers of items of property, plant and equipment by entities that receive such transfers from their customers.\n5\nAgreements within the scope of this Interpretation are agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both.\n6\nThis Interpretation also applies to agreements in which an entity receives cash from a customer when that amount of cash must be used only to construct or acquire an item of property, plant and equipment and the entity must then use the item of property, plant and equipment either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both.\n7\nThis Interpretation does not apply to agreements in which the transfer is either a government grant as defined in IAS 20 or infrastructure used in a service concession arrangement that is within the scope of IFRIC 12.\nISSUES\n8\nThe Interpretation addresses the following issues:\n(a)\nIs the definition of an asset met?\n(b)\nIf the definition of an asset is met, how should the transferred item of property, plant and equipment be measured on initial recognition?\n(c)\nIf the item of property, plant and equipment is measured at fair value on initial recognition, how should the resulting credit be accounted for?\n(d)\nHow should the entity account for a transfer of cash from its customer?\nCONSENSUS\nIs the definition of an asset met?\n9\nWhen an entity receives from a customer a transfer of an item of property, plant and equipment, it shall assess whether the transferred item meets the definition of an asset set out in the\nFramework\n. Paragraph 49(a) of the\nFramework\nstates that ‘an asset is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.’ In most circumstances, the entity obtains the right of ownership of the transferred item of property, plant and equipment. However, in determining whether an asset exists, the right of ownership is not essential. Therefore, if the customer continues to control the transferred item, the asset definition would not be met despite a transfer of ownership.\n10\nAn entity that controls an asset can generally deal with that asset as it pleases. For example, the entity can exchange that asset for other assets, employ it to produce goods or services, charge a price for others to use it, use it to settle liabilities, hold it, or distribute it to owners. The entity that receives from a customer a transfer of an item of property, plant and equipment shall consider all relevant facts and circumstances when assessing control of the transferred item. For example, although the entity must use the transferred item of property, plant and equipment to provide one or more services to the customer, it may have the ability to decide how the transferred item of property, plant and equipment is operated and maintained and when it is replaced. In this case, the entity would normally conclude that it controls the transferred item of property, plant and equipment.\nHow should the transferred item of property, plant and equipment be measured on initial recognition?\n11\nIf the entity concludes that the definition of an asset is met, it shall recognise the transferred asset as an item of property, plant and equipment in accordance with paragraph 7 of IAS 16 and measure its cost on initial recognition at its fair value in accordance with paragraph 24 of that Standard.\nHow should the credit be accounted for?\n12\nThe following discussion assumes that the entity receiving an item of property, plant and equipment has concluded that the transferred item should be recognised and measured in accordance with paragraphs 9–11.\n13\nParagraph 12 of IAS 18 states that ‘When goods are sold or services are rendered in exchange for dissimilar goods or services, the exchange is regarded as a transaction which generates revenue.’ According to the terms of the agreements within the scope of this Interpretation, a transfer of an item of property, plant and equipment would be an exchange for dissimilar goods or services. Consequently, the entity shall recognise revenue in accordance with IAS 18.\nIdentifying the separately identifiable services\n14\nAn entity may agree to deliver one or more services in exchange for the transferred item of property, plant and equipment, such as connecting the customer to a network, providing the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or both. In accordance with paragraph 13 of IAS 18, the entity shall identify the separately identifiable services included in the agreement.\n15\nFeatures that indicate that connecting the customer to a network is a separately identifiable service include:\n(a)\na service connection is delivered to the customer and represents stand-alone value for that customer;\n(b)\nthe fair value of the service connection can be measured reliably.\n16\nA feature that indicates that providing the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services is a separately identifiable service is that, in the future, the customer making the transfer receives the ongoing access, the goods or services, or both at a price lower than would be charged without the transfer of the item of property, plant and equipment.\n17\nConversely, a feature that indicates that the obligation to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services arises from the terms of the entity's operating licence or other regulation rather than from the agreement relating to the transfer of an item of property, plant and equipment is that customers that make a transfer pay the same price as those that do not for the ongoing access, or for the goods or services, or for both.\nRevenue recognition\n18\nIf only one service is identified, the entity shall recognise revenue when the service is performed in accordance with paragraph 20 of IAS 18.\n19\nIf more than one separately identifiable service is identified, paragraph 13 of IAS 18 requires the fair value of the total consideration received or receivable for the agreement to be allocated to each service and the recognition criteria of IAS 18 are then applied to each service.\n20\nIf an ongoing service is identified as part of the agreement, the period over which revenue shall be recognised for that service is generally determined by the terms of the agreement with the customer. If the agreement does not specify a period, the revenue shall be recognised over a period no longer than the useful life of the transferred asset used to provide the ongoing service.\nHow should the entity account for a transfer of cash from its customer?\n21\nWhen an entity receives a transfer of cash from a customer, it shall assess whether the agreement is within the scope of this Interpretation in accordance with paragraph 6. If it is, the entity shall assess whether the constructed or acquired item of property, plant and equipment meets the definition of an asset in accordance with paragraphs 9 and 10. If the definition of an asset is met, the entity shall recognise the item of property, plant and equipment at its cost in accordance with IAS 16 and shall recognise revenue in accordance with paragraphs 13–20 at the amount of cash received from the customer.\nEFFECTIVE DATE AND TRANSITION\n22\nAn entity shall apply this Interpretation prospectively to transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009. Earlier application is permitted provided the valuations and other information needed to apply the Interpretation to past transfers were obtained at the time those transfers occurred. An entity shall disclose the date from which the Interpretation was applied.""}], 'appendices': [{'id': 'anx_1.app_1', 'type': 'appendix', 'title': 'Appendix', 'text': 'Appendix\nAmendment to IFRS 1\nFirst-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards\n(as revised in 2008)\nA1\nIn Appendix D paragraph D1 is amended as follows.\n‘D1\nAn entity may elect to use one or more of the following exemptions:\n(a)\nshare-based payment transactions (paragraphs D2 and D3);\n(m)\nfinancial assets or intangible assets accounted for in accordance with IFRIC 12\nService Concession Arrangements\n(paragraph D22);\n(n)\nborrowing costs (paragraph D23); and\n(o)\ntransfers of assets from customers (paragraph D24).’\nA2\nAfter paragraph D23 a heading and paragraph D24 are added.\n‘\nTransfers of assets from customers\nD24\nA first-time adopter may apply the transitional provisions set out in paragraph 22 of IFRIC 18\nTransfers of Assets from Customers\n.

Having regard to the Treaty on European Union, and in particular Article 29 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 6 March 2014, the Heads of State or Government of the Union's Member States strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation.
(2) On 17 March 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/145/CFSP (1) concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.
(3) At its meeting on 20-21 March 2014, the European Council strongly condemned the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (‘Crimea’) and the city of Sevastopol (‘Sevastopol’) to the Russian Federation and emphasised that it will not recognise it. The European Council considered that certain economic, trade and financial restrictions regarding Crimea should be proposed for rapid implementation.
(4) On 27 March 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, affirming its commitment to the sovereignty, political independence, unity and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognised borders, underscoring the invalidity of the referendum held in Crimea on 16 March, and calling upon all States not to recognise any alterations to the status of Crimea and Sevastopol.
(5) In these circumstances, the Council considers that the import into the European Union of goods originating in Crimea or Sevastopol should be prohibited, with the exception of goods originating in Crimea or Sevastopol having been granted a certificate of origin by the Government of Ukraine.
(6) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Decision are effective, it should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.
(7) Further action by the Union is needed in order to implement certain measures,","{'header': '24.6.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 183/70', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\xa02014/386/CFSP\nof 23 June 2014\nconcerning restrictions on goods originating in Crimea or Sevastopol, in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 6 March 2014, the Heads of State or Government of the Union's Member States strongly condemned the unprovoked violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation.\n\n((2)) On\xa017\xa0March 2014, the Council adopted Decision 2014/145/CFSP(1)concerning restrictive measures in respect of actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.\n\n((3)) At its meeting on 20-21\xa0March\xa02014, the European Council strongly condemned the illegal annexation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (‘Crimea’) and the city of Sevastopol (‘Sevastopol’) to the Russian Federation and emphasised that it will not recognise it.

As regards criterion (i) of Annex II, the following guidelines are given:\n\n(a) in deciding whether the recipient or parental micro-organism is likely to cause disease to animals or plants consideration should be given to the environment likely to be exposed to the recipient or parental micro-organism;\n\n(b) non-virulent strains of acknowledged pathogenic species could be considered as unlikely to cause disease and as satisfying criterion (i) in Annex II, provided that:\n\n(i) the non-virulent strain has an established record of safety in the laboratory and/or industry with no adverse effects on human, animal or plant health;\n\nand/or\n\n(ii) the strain is stably deficient in genetic material that determines virulence, or has stable mutations known to sufficiently reduce virulence.\n\nWhen it is not essential to remove all virulence determinants from a pathogen, particular attention should be paid to any toxin genes, plasmid- or phageborne virulence determinants and harmful adventitious agents. On such occasions a case by case evaluation will be needed.\n\n3. As regards criterion (ii) of Annex II, the following guidelines are given:\n\n(a) The vector/insert should not contain genes expressing an active protein or transcript (e. g. virulence determinants, toxins, etc.) at a level and in a form which endow the genetically modified micro-organism with a phenotype likely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants.\n\nIn any case, when the vector/insert contains sequences which are involved in the expression of harmful traits in certain micro-organisms, but which do not endow the GMM with a phenotype likely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants, or likely to cause adverse effects on the environment, then the vector/insert should not be self-transmissible and should be poorly mobilizable.\n\n(b) In the case of Type B operations, special consideration should be given to the following:\n\n- vectors should not be self-transmissible or contain functional transposing sequences; and should be poorly mobilizable,\n\n- in deciding whether the vector/insert is likely to endow the genetically modified micro-organism with a phenotype likely to cause disease to humans, animals or plants or to cause adverse effects in the environment, it is important to ensure that the vector/insert is well characterized or limited in size as much as possible to the genetic sequences required to perform the intended function.\n\n4. As regards criterion (iii) of Annex II, the following guidelines are given:\n\n(a) in deciding whether the gentically modified micro-organism is likely to cause adverse effects on the environment or disease to animals or plants, consideration should be given to the environment likely to be exposed to the GMMs.\n\n(b) in the case of type B operations, in addition to criterion (iii), consideration should be given to the following:\n\n- the genetically modified micro-organism should not transfer any resistance markers to micro-organisms, if such transfer compromise disease treatment;\n\n- the genetically modified micro-organism should be as safe in the industrial setting as the recipient or parental micro-organism, or have characteristics that limit survival and gene transfer.\n\n(c) other GMMs which could be included in Group I if they are without adverse effects on the environment and meet the conditions in Annex II (i) are those that are constructed entirely from a single prokaryotic recipient (including its indigenous plasmids, transposons and viruses), or from a single eukaryotic recipient (including its chloroplasts, mitochondria, plasmids, but excluding viruses), or consist entirely of genetic sequences from different species that exchange these sequences by known physiological processes.\n\nBefore deciding if these GMMs are to be included in Group I it should be considered whether they are excluded from the Directive under the provisions of Annex I B (4), taking into account that self-cloning means the removal of nucleic acid from a cell of an organism, followed by reinsertion of all or part of that nucleic acid - with or without further enzymic chemical or mechanical steps - into the same cell type (or cell-line) or into cells of phylogenetically closely related species which can naturally exchange genetic material with the donor species.'}]}"

","COMMISSION DECISION of 13 December 1994 authorizing the grant by the United  Kingdom of aid to the coal industry (Only the English text is authentic) (Text with EEA relevance)  (94/1042/ECSC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community.
Having regard to Commission Decision No 2064/86/ECSC of 30 June 1986 establishing Community rules  for State aid to the coal industry (1),
Whereas:
I By letters of 26 September 1994 and of 15 November 1994, the United Kingdom notified the  Commission, in conformity with Article 9 (2) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, of financial measures it  has taken in respect of the coal industry during the period 1986 to 1993.
The following aid is submitted for the approval of the Commission pursuant to Decision No  2064/86/ECSC:
- 1 390 000 pounds sterling to the private coal mining industry in the form of investment grants  for the development of mines for the period 1986 to 1993.
Since the decision to grant the investment aid was taken prior to the 1 January 1994, the measure  planned by the United Kingdom to support the coal industry complies with Article 1 (1) of Decision  No 2064/86/ECSC. Consequently, pursuant to Article 10 thereof the Commission must determine whether  the measure is compatible with the objectives and criteria laid down in that Decision and the  proper functioning of the common market.
II Under the terms of the Coal Industry Nationalization Act 1946, coal mining in the United Kingdom  has been the responsibility of the State-owned National Coal Board and of its successor, the  British Coal Corporation. Nevertheless, under Section 36 of the abovementioned Act, coal mining was  permitted by the private sector under strict licensing arrangements with the British Coal  Corporation.
The private coal mining sector in the United Kingdom has therefore been relatively restricted,  consisting of very small drift mines or opencast sites generally situated in regions with economic  difficulties and with high levels of unemployment. Total private sector coal production has  historically been of the order of 3 % of the total UK output.
In 1984 the United Kingdom notified to the Commission amendments to the Regional Selective  Assistance Scheme, which were approved by the Commission on 26 December 1984. This regional aid  scheme is designed to enable projects to go ahead where these have good prospects of commercial  viability, but where certain financial assistance, in the form of grants, is necessary for the  project to proceed. It covers a wide range of activities, including projects and ventures in the  coal sector.
In approving the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme, the Commission reminded the United Kingdom  Government that the Community legislation and codes applicable to certain sectors of industry had  to be observed in the implementation of the regional aid system. Any financial assistance which  gives coal industry undertakings an economic advantage has to be assessed within the context of the  ECSC Treaty and, in particular, under the provisions of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
The United Kingdom Government recognizes its oversight in not having previously sought Commission  approval before committing itself to provide assistance to coal industry undertakings. Since all  the measures were decided upon, and the budgetary commitments made, by the United Kingdom  Government during the period 1986 to 1993, they will have to be evaluated under the provisions of  the Decision then in force, namely Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
III The following aid has therefore been submitted for the approval of the Commission pursuant to  Decision No 2064/86/ECSC:
- an investment grant of up to 70 000 pounds sterling to Caledon Coal Limited towards the reopening  of a coal mine at Skares, near Cumnock, Ayrshire,
- an investment grant of up to 30 000 pounds sterling to Signal Fern Limited towards the  development of a new coal mine at Cwmhwnt, Rhigos, Mid Glamorgan,
- an investment grant of up to 20 000 pounds sterling to New Parc Fuels Limited towards the  development of a coal mine at Bryn Newydd, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan,
- an investment grant of up to 98 000 pounds sterling to Ffyonau Duon Mines Limited towards the  development of a drift coal mine at Blaentillery, Blaenavon, Gwent,
- an investment grant of up to 75 000 pounds sterling to Cavendish Coal Company Limited towards the  further development of the coal mine and the construction of a new coal preparation plant at  Viaduct Mine, Glenbuck, near Muirkirk, Ayrshire,
- an investment grant of up to 75 000 pounds sterling to Coleston Mining Limited towards the  further development and coalwashing facility at Craigman Mine, near Burnstone Cottage, Dalgig, New  Cumnock, Ayrshire,
- an investment grant of up to 750 000 pounds sterling to Ryan Mining Limited towards the  development of a drift coal mine at Pentreclwydau, Resolven, West Glamorgan,
- an investment grant of up to 20 000 pounds sterling to Perfect Skills Limited towards an  expansion of mining activities at Rithan Colliery, Blanenau Gwent, Gwent,
- an investment grant of up to 12 000 pounds sterling to Venture Coal Limited towards reopening  Pentre Colliery, Llanon, Dyfed,
- an investment grant of up to 100 000 pounds sterling to Ammanford Development Company Limited  towards the development of a drift coal mine, washery and bagging plant at Glanaman, Dyfed,
- an investment grant of up to 60 000 pounds sterling to Blwch Ton Mining Company Limited towards  plant, machinery and equipment to enable the reopening of the Blwch Ton coal mine at Resolven, West  Glamorgan,
- an investment grant of up to 80 000 pounds sterling to Thomas Merthyr Limited towards the  development of the Nant Melyn coal mine at Seven Sisters, Neath, West Glamorgan.
Aid for investment must be considered with regard to the objectives of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC, in  particular those specified in Article 2 (1). The fact that the aid is a one-off payment for  production sites which will then be economically competitive, without any further State aid, means  that the measures contribute to creating new capacities that are economically viable. They are  therefore compatible with the second indent of Article 2 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
The geographical location of these sites, in regions which are economically and socially  disadvantaged, with high levels of unemployment, means that the measures contribute to solving the  social and regional problems related to developments in the coal industry. They are therefore  compatible with the third indent of Article 2 (1) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.
The aid measures will not, according to the United Kingdom's notification, exceed more than 50 % of  the costs of the investment for each of the coal undertakings concerned nor do they exceed the  minimum amounts of capital investment requiring prior notification provided for in High Authority  Decision No 22/66 (1), as amended by Decision No 2237/73/ECSC (2). They therefore comply with the  provisions of the first and second indents of Article 5 (1) of Decision No 2064/76/ECSC.
The United Kingdom will ensure that the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme, in so far as it  concerns the coal sector, does not lead to any discrimination, within the meaning of Article 4 (b)  of the ECSC Treaty, between producers, between purchasers or between consumers.
IV The aid measures covered by this Decision are therefore compatible with the proper functioning of  the common market,","{'title': '94/1042/ECSC: Commission Decision of 13 December 1994 authorizing the grant by the United Kingdom of aid to the coal industry (Text with EEA relevance)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe United Kingdom is hereby authorized to grant aid totalling 390  000 pounds sterling to the coal industry for the period 1986 to 1993.\n\n- an investment grant of up to 70 000 pounds sterling to Caledon Coal Limited towards the reopening  of a coal mine at Skares, near Cumnock, Ayrshire,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 30 000 pounds sterling to Signal Fern Limited towards the  development of a new coal mine at Cwmhwnt, Rhigos, Mid Glamorgan,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 20 000 pounds sterling to New Parc Fuels Limited towards the  development of a coal mine at Bryn Newydd, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 98 000 pounds sterling to Ffyonau Duon Mines Limited towards the  development of a drift coal mine at Blaentillery, Blaenavon, Gwent,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 75 000 pounds sterling to Cavendish Coal Company Limited towards the  further development of the coal mine and the construction of a new coal preparation plant at  Viaduct Mine, Glenbuck, near Muirkirk, Ayrshire,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 75 000 pounds sterling to Coleston Mining Limited towards the  further development and coalwashing facility at Craigman Mine, near Burnstone Cottage, Dalgig, New  Cumnock, Ayrshire,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 750 000 pounds sterling to Ryan Mining Limited towards the  development of a drift coal mine at Pentreclwydau, Resolven, West Glamorgan,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 20 000 pounds sterling to Perfect Skills Limited towards an  expansion of mining activities at Rithan Colliery, Blanenau Gwent, Gwent,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 12 000 pounds sterling to Venture Coal Limited towards reopening  Pentre Colliery, Llanon, Dyfed,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 100 000 pounds sterling to Ammanford Development Company Limited  towards the development of a drift coal mine, washery and bagging plant at Glanaman, Dyfed,\n\n- an investment grant of up to 60 000 pounds sterling to Blwch Ton Mining Company Limited towards  plant, machinery and equipment to enable the reopening of the Blwch Ton coal mine at Resolven, West  Glamorgan.\n\n- an investment grant of up to 80 000 pounds sterling to Thomas Merthyr Limited towards the  development of the Nant Melyn coal mine at Seven Sisters, Neath, West Glamorgan.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe United Kingdom shall inform the Commission annually of the payments made to the  beneficiaries authorized pursuant to Article 1 of this Decision.\n\nThe United Kingdom shall also inform the Commission annually of the amount of investment  expenditure assigned to each of the projects under consideration for aid, in conformity with  Article 5 (3) of Decision No 2064/86/ECSC.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the United Kingdom.\n\nDone at Brussels, 13 December 1994.\n\nFor the Commission Marcelino OREJA Member of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ No L 177, 1. 7. 1986, p. 1.\n\n(1) OJ No 219, 29. 11. 1966, p. 3728/66.\n\n(2) OJ No L 229, 17. 8. 1973, p. 28.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 of 28 October 1996 on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular the third subparagraph of Article 35(3),
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1961/2001 (2) lays down the detailed rules of application for export refunds on fruit and vegetables.
(2) Article 35(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that, to the extent necessary for economically significant exports, the products exported by the Community may be covered by export refunds, within the limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, care must be taken to ensure that the trade flows previously brought about by the refund scheme are not disrupted. For this reason and because exports of fruit and vegetables are seasonal in nature, the quantities scheduled for each product should be fixed, based on the agricultural product nomenclature for export refunds established by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (3). These quantities must be allocated taking account of the perishability of the products concerned.
(4) Article 35(4) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that refunds must be fixed in the light of the existing situation or outlook for fruit and vegetable prices on the Community market and supplies available on the one hand, and prices on the international market on the other hand. Account must also be taken of the transport and marketing costs and of the economic aspect of the exports planned.
(5) In accordance with Article 35(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96, prices on the Community market are to be established in the light of the most favourable prices from the export standpoint.
(6) The international trade situation or the special requirements of certain markets may call for the refund on a given product to vary according to its destination.
(7) Tomatoes, oranges, lemons, table grapes, apples and peaches of classes Extra, I and II of the common quality standards can currently be exported in economically significant quantities.
(8) In order to ensure the best use of available resources and in view of the structure of Community exports, it is appropriate to fix the A1 and B export refunds.
(9) The negotiations within the framework of the Europe Agreements between the European Community and Romania and Bulgaria aim in particular to liberalise trade in products covered by the common organisation of the market concerned. For these two countries export refunds should therefore be abolished.

Pursuant to Article 3a of that Decision, Member States may obtain a Community financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate avian influenza.
(2) Article 3a(3) of Decision 90/424/EEC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by Member States that may be covered by the Community’s financial contribution.

It is therefore necessary to expressly provide in the present Decision that the granting of a Community financial contribution to Portugal is subject to compliance with certain rules laid down in that Regulation.
(4) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in Portugal in 2007. The emergence of that disease represents a serious risk to the Community’s livestock population. Portugal took measures, as referred to in Article 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC, to combat those outbreaks.
(5) Portugal has fully complied with its technical and administrative obligations as set out in Articles 3(3) and 3a(2) of Decision 90/424/EEC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(6) Portugal submitted to the Commission information on the costs incurred on 7 November 2007, and has continued to provide all necessary information on costs of compensation and operational expenditure.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down eradication measures to be carried out following the confirmation of a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in ovine and caprine animals.
(2) In the framework of the Communication from the Commission TSE Roadmap (2) of 15 July 2005, and in line with the SANCO work programme 2006-07 on TSEs (3) of 21 November 2006, the Commission adopted Regulation (EC) No 727/2007 of 26 June 2007 amending Annexes I, III, VII and X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as thus amended, provides for certain measures to be applied in the case of confirmation of a TSE in a holding of ovine or caprine animals and where the presence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been excluded.
(3) Given that the structure of the sector for ovine and caprine animals is notoriously different across the Community, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 727/2007, introduced the possibility to apply alternative policies, provided that harmonised rules are established at Community level.
(4) Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, before the amendments made thereto by Regulation (EC) No 727/2007, provided for a derogation regarding the destruction of ovine and caprine animals following the confirmation on a holding of a case of TSE in such animals. Accordingly, Member States could decide to delay the destruction of the animals up to five breeding years under certain conditions. However, that derogation was not included in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as thus amended, as it was no longer necessary.
(5) On 17 July 2007, in Case T-257/07, before the Court of First Instance of the European Communities, France brought an action against the European Commission seeking the annulment of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 727/2007, in particular regarding the measures to be applied to TSE-affected flocks, or alternatively the entire annulment of that Regulation. In its Order of 28 September 2007, as an interim measure, the Court suspended the application of those provisions until a final judgment is delivered.
(6) Following that Order, the Member States have no longer the possibility to apply the suspended measures. Therefore, certain Member States may have difficulties to proceed with the immediate destruction of the animals concerned.
(7) It is therefore necessary to reintroduce the derogation that applied before the amendments made to the relevant provisions of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, by Regulation (EC) No 727/2007, in order to allow Member States where the frequency of the ARR allele within the breed or holding is low, or where it is deemed necessary in order to avoid inbreeding, to delay the destruction of the animals concerned up to five breeding years, as from the date of that Order.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.

Therefore, certain Member States may have difficulties to proceed with the immediate destruction of the animals concerned.\n\n((7)) It is therefore necessary to reintroduce the derogation that applied before the amendments made to the relevant provisions of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, by Regulation (EC) No 727/2007, in order to allow Member States where the frequency of the ARR allele within the breed or holding is low, or where it is deemed necessary in order to avoid inbreeding, to delay the destruction of the animals concerned up to five breeding years, as from the date of that Order.\n\n((8)) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.\n\n((9)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nIn Annex VII, Chapter A, point 2.3, the following point (f) is added:\n‘(f)\nWhere the frequency of the ARR allele within the breed or holding is low, or where it is deemed necessary in order to avoid inbreeding, a Member State may decide to delay the destruction of animals as referred to in point 2.3 (b)(i) and (ii) for up to five breeding years.’'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.\nIt shall apply from 28 September 2007.'}]}"

Whereas the use of asbestos and even products containing it can, by releasing fibres, cause asbestosis, mesothelioma and lung cancer; whereas placing on the market and use should therefore be subject to the severest possible restrictions;
Whereas Council Directive 83/478/EEC (4) amending for the fifth time Directive 76/769/EEC specified that the crocidolite type of asbestos fibre and products containing it may, with three possible exceptions, no longer be placed on the market and used;  whereas this same Directive established obligatory labelling provisions for all products containing asbestos fibres;

Whereas improved monitoring of the marketing and use of dangerous asbestos fibres is necessary to protect human heath, especially as there are for certain uses substitute products regarded, on the basis of risk analysis, as less dangerous;
Whereas a very effective way of protecting human health and the environment is to prohibit the use of certain fibres, such as those of amphibole asbestos, which according to some scientific sources are particularly dangerous; whereas for practical  reasons such a prohibition can not for the time being be extended to naturally-occuring materials such as ores and sand containing asbestos fibres as natural impurities;
Whereas a fibre fixity test to assess the dangers posed by particular asbestos-containing products is not yet widely available; whereas, notwithstanding this, products should be promoted which reduce the overall risk to man and the environment;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43 and 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas, in Decision No 1/77, the EEC-Turkey Association Council, pursuant to Article 35 (3) of the Additional Protocol, as amended by Article 10 of the Interim Agreement signed on 30 June 1973, established the arrangements to be applied to imports into the Community of certain agricultural products originating in Turkey;
Whereas the implementation of that Decision involves the adaptation of Community Regulations;
Whereas the provisions regarding imports into the Community of certain agricultural products originating in Turkey have been amended on a number of occasions following Association Council Decisions ; whereas the texts in question, since they are to be found in various Official Journals, are difficult to use and therefore lack the necessary clarity which any Regulation must have ; whereas it is therefore necessary to consolidate them;
Whereas, moreover, in order to bring together in a single Regulation all the provisions regarding imports into the Community of agricultural products originating in Turkey, it is desirable to incorporate in this Regulation the provisions laid down by Council Acts in implementation of the provisions of the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey;
Whereas Article 4 of Annex 6 to the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey provides for a tariff reduction for imports into the Community of fresh lemons originating in Turkey ; whereas, during the period of application of the reference prices this reduction is subject to the observance of a given price on the internal market of the Community ; whereas the implementation of these arrangements requires the adoption of detailed rules for their application;
Whereas the proposed arrangements must be included in the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables ; whereas it is therefore necessary to take account of the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 795/76 (3), and of those adopted pursuant to that Regulation;
Whereas Article 12 of Annex 6 to the Additional Protocol to the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey stipulates that the levy on imports of durum wheat and canary seed produced in Turkey and transported direct from that country into the Community shall be the levy calculated in accordance with Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3138/76 (5), less 0 75 unit of account per tonne;
Whereas Article 13 of the abovementioned Annex stipulates that, on condition that Turkey applies a special charge on exports of rye into the Community, the levy on imports into the Community of that product, calculated in accordance with Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, shall be reduced by an amount equal to that of the charge paid up to a maximum of eight units of account per tonne;
Whereas it is necessary to stipulate, in accordance with the Additional Protocol, that the special charge referred to above shall be reflected in the price of rye imported into  (1)OJ No C 118, 16.5.1977, p. 68.

","COMMISSION DECISION of 29 July 1998 terminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru (notified under document number C(1998) 2410) (98/478/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), and in particular Article 14(1) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
I. PROCEDURE
(1) In September 1997, the Commission received a complaint concerning alleged injurious subsidisation of imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru.
(2) The complaint was lodged by Xantoflor SA (Monteagudo, Spain) which represents more than 25 % of Community production of the product concerned, and was supported by Alchim SA and Sofral SA (Illkirch, France). Together these producers represent a major proportion of Community production of cochineal carmine as defined in Article 10(8) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 as none of the other producers expressed its opinion on the complaint.
(3) The complaint contained prima facie evidence of the existence of countervailable subsidies on cochineal carmine and material injury resulting therefrom which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding.
(4) Accordingly, the Commission, after consultation, announced in a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports into the Community of cochineal carmine falling within CN code ex 3205 00 00 originating in Peru.
(5) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country and the complainant Community producers. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
II. WITHDRAWAL OF THE COMPLAINT AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDING
(6) Of the three producers that supported the complaint, only Xantoflor SA and Alchim SA supplied the Commission with a comprehensive reply to its questionnaire and thus cooperated with the investigation. These producers account for more than 25 % of total Community production of the product concerned. As no Community producers opposed the present investigation these companies' output thus constitutes a major proportion of the Community production, as defined in Article 10(8) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97.
(7) In the course of the investigation Xantoflor SA informed the Commission, by letter of 11 June 1998, that it formally withdrew its complaint concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru as it had become apparent that circumstances had changed to the extent that the Community industry and in particular Xantoflor may not have been suffering material injury.
(8) As Xantoflor SA and Alchim SA together constitute the Community industry and the output of Alchim SA represents but a small proportion of the total Community production of cochineal carmine, the complaint would not have the support of a major proportion of the Community producers, even if Alchim SA continued to support it.
(9) In accordance with Article 14 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, when the complainant withdraws its complaint the proceeding may be terminated unless such termination would not be in the Community interest. The present investigation has not brought to light any considerations of Community interest which would be against the termination of the proceedings.
(10) Interested parties were informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which the Commission intended to terminate the proceeding, were given the opportunity to comment and did not raise any objection.
(11) The Advisory Committee has been consulted and has raised no objection.
(12) In these circumstances, the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru should be terminated without imposition of protective measures,",{'title': '98/478/EC: Commission Decision of 29 July 1998 terminating the anti-subsidy proceeding concerning imports of cochineal carmine originating in Peru (notified under document number C(1998) 2410)'}

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (‘the basic Regulation’) (1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   REQUEST FOR A REVIEW
(1) The Commission has received an application for a ‘new exporter’ review pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. The application was lodged by TRL China Ltd (‘the applicant’), an exporting producer in the People’s Republic of China (‘the country concerned’).
B.   PRODUCT
(2) The product under review is chemically bonded, unfired magnesia bricks, whose magnesia component contains at least 80 % MgO, whether or not containing magnesite, originating in the People’s Republic of China (‘the product concerned’), currently falling within CN codes ex 6815 91 00, ex 6815 99 10 and ex 6815 99 90 (TARIC codes 6815910010, 6815991020 and 6815999020).
C.   EXISTING MEASURES
(3) The measures currently in force are a definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005 (2) under which imports into the Union of the product concerned originating in the People’s Republic of China, including the product concerned produced by the applicant, are subject to a definitive anti-dumping duty of 39,9 % with the exception of several companies specifically mentioned which are subject to individual duty rates.
D.   GROUNDS FOR THE REVIEW
(4) The applicant alleges that it operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively claims individual treatment in conformity with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. It further alleges that it did not export the product concerned to the Union during the period of investigation on which the anti-dumping measures were based, i.e. the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004 (‘the original investigation period’) and that it is not related to any of the exporting producers of the product which are subject to the above mentioned anti-dumping measures.
(5) The applicant further alleges that it has begun exporting the product concerned to the Union after the end of the original investigation period.
E.   PROCEDURE
(6) Union producers known to be concerned have been informed of the above application and have been given an opportunity to comment.
(7) Having examined the evidence available, the Commission concludes that there is sufficient evidence to justify the initiation of a ‘new exporter’ review, pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation. Upon receipt of the claim mentioned below under recital 13, it will be determined whether the applicant operates under market economy conditions as defined in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation or alternatively whether the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation. If so, the applicant’s individual margin of dumping shall be calculated and, should dumping be found, the level of the duty to which its imports of the product concerned into the Union should be subject shall be determined.
(8) If it is determined that the applicant fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established, it may be necessary to amend the rate of duty currently applicable to imports of the product concerned from companies not individually mentioned in Article 1(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1659/2005.
(a)   Questionnaires
(9) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send a questionnaire to the applicant.
(b)   Collection of information and holding of hearings
(10) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence.
(11) Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing showing that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(12) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the parties making themselves known within the period provided for by the present Regulation.
(c)   Market economy treatment/individual treatment
(13) In the event that the applicant provides sufficient evidence that it operates under market economy conditions, i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 2(7)(c) of the basic Regulation, normal value will be determined in accordance with Article 2(7)(b) of the basic Regulation. For this purpose, duly substantiated claims must be submitted within the specific time limit set in Article 4(3) of this Regulation. The Commission will send claim forms to the applicant, as well as to the authorities of the People’s Republic of China. This claim form may also be used by the applicant to claim individual treatment, i.e. that it meets the criteria laid down in Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation.
(d)   Selection of the market economy country
(14) In the event that the applicant is not granted market economy treatment but fulfils the requirements to have an individual duty established in accordance with Article 9(5) of the basic Regulation, an appropriate market economy country will be used for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China in accordance with Article 2(7)(a) of the basic Regulation. The Commission envisages using the United States of America again for this purpose as was done in the investigation which led to the imposition of measures on imports of the product concerned from the People’s Republic of China. Interested parties are hereby invited to comment on the appropriateness of this choice within the specific time limit set in Article 4(2) of this Regulation.
(15) Furthermore, in the event that the applicant is granted market economy treatment, the Commission may, if necessary, also use findings concerning the normal value established in an appropriate market-economy country, e.g. for the purpose of replacing any unreliable cost or price elements in the People’s Republic of China which are needed in establishing the normal value, if reliable required data are not available in the People’s Republic of China. The Commission envisages using the United States of America also for this purpose.
F.   REPEAL OF THE DUTY IN FORCE AND REGISTRATION OF IMPORTS
(16) Pursuant to Article 11(4) of the basic Regulation, the anti-dumping duty in force should be repealed with regard to imports of the product concerned which are produced and sold for export to the Union by the applicant. At the same time, such imports should be made subject to registration in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation, in order to ensure that, should the review result in a finding of dumping in respect of the applicant, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively from the date of the initiation of this review. The amount of the applicant’s possible future liabilities cannot be estimated at this stage of the proceeding.
G.   TIME LIMITS
(17) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
— interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit the replies to the questionnaire mentioned in recital 8(a) of this Regulation or provide any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
— interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission,
— interested parties may comment on the appropriateness of the United States of America which, in the event that the applicant will not be granted market economy treatment, is envisaged as a market-economy country for the purpose of establishing normal value in respect of the People’s Republic of China,
— the applicant should submit a duly substantiated claim for market economy treatment.
H.   NON-COOPERATION
(18) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or does not provide the necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(19) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate or cooperates only partially, and findings are therefore based on the facts available in accordance with Article 18 of the basic Regulation, the result may be less favourable to that party than if it had cooperated.
I.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(20) Please note that any personal data collected in this investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (3).

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 108 (3) thereof,
Whereas the United Kingdom's economic situation has entailed serious balance of payments difficulties and consequently marked fluctuations in the sterling exchange rate;
Whereas by Decision 75/487/EEC of 23 July 1975 (1) the Commission authorized the United Kingdom, on a temporary basis, to maintain, within the limit of the measures actually in force on the date when the above Decision was notified, restrictions on certain capital movements because this Member State was not in a position to fulfil its obligations under Article 124 (1) (a) and (b) of the Act of Accession;
Whereas by Decision 77/457/EEC of 28 June 1977 (2) the Commission amended Decision 75/487/EEC;
Whereas the United Kingdom's external position is such that a complete relaxation as from 1 January 1978 of the controls on those capital movements covered by Article 124 of the Act of Accession would seriously threaten the United Kingdom with balance of payments difficulties;
Whereas because of the possible threat to the balance of payments, the United Kingdom has informed the Commission that it is not in a position to fulfil the obligations arising from Article 124 (1) (c) of the Act of Accession, and in this connection has asked to be authorized to take certain protective measures;
Whereas the Commission, after investigating the position of the United Kingdom's economy under Article 108 (1), and the measures taken by the United Kingdom, made a recommendation to it on 14 December 1977, under Article 108 (1) of the Treaty;
Whereas, however, the measures recommended to the United Kingdom under Article 108 (1) of the Treaty are not sufficient, since they cannot by themselves make any immediate and sufficient contribution to strengthening the United Kingdom's external position;
Whereas no mutual assistance has been granted under Article 108 (2) of the Treaty;
Whereas the strengthening of its external financial position requires the temporary maintenance by the United Kingdom of the measures in force derogating from Community obligations in respect of the free movement of capital;
Whereas, however, certain changes are now possible in respect of direct investments and in capital movements of a personal nature by United Kingdom residents in other Member States, and in respect of transactions in securities by residents of the United Kingdom;
Whereas it is appropriate to combine together in one Decision any new derogations from Community obligations in respect of the free movement of capital with existing derogation from such obligations;

of 19 December 2000
on the granting of exceptional national aid by the Government of the French Republic for the distillation of certain wine sector products
(2000/810/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 88(2), third subparagraph, thereof,
Having regard to the request made by the Government of the French Republic on 8 December 2000,
Whereas:
(1) Article 29 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine(1) allows Community support for the distillation of wines in order to support the wine market and, as a consequence, facilitate the continuation of supplies of wine distillate.
(2) Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 allows a crisis distillation measure if there is an exceptional case of wine market disturbance caused by serious surpluses and/or problems of quality.
(3) In the course of the 2000/2001 wine-growing year, it has become clear that the timetable for beginning distillation operations is unsuited to certain vineyards. The distribution of contract applications shows that the measure is not equally accessible to all wine-growing regions, particularly in France, where the price of EUR 2,488/% vol/hl is out of line with the production costs of wine-growers, in particular those who have made efforts to improve quality. Furthermore, operators are tending to adopt an opportunist approach in a situation of increased competition on the alcohol market. The last two sizeable harvests following upon three low harvests, coupled with an unforeseeable reduction in consumption and a drop in exports, have led to a considerable increase of 40 % of stocks in some regions.
(4) The operation and practice of distillation by jobbing distillers, which seems to be spreading, and the crisis distillation introduced on a case-by-case basis at the request of Member States with the adoption of prices that differ according to the requests, in the French Government's view, require detailed examination in order to assess their effects on the market.
(5) To deal with the situation, the French Government is planning to grant exceptional aid to producers who supply wine for one of the forms of distillation referred to in Articles 29 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and who do not exceed a crop yield ceiling fixed at 90 hectolitres per hectare, so that the national addition to wine prices will bring the price up to EUR 3,7/% vol/hl for a quota of 1000000 hectolitres requested pursuant to Article 29. In this case, the overall amount of national aid will be EUR 12,2 million. Should it not prove possible to implement this measure fully from the quota available pursuant to Article 29, it would be implemented pursuant to Article 30 and the maximum cost of the national measure would then be EUR 17,86 million.
(6) Exceptional circumstances therefore exist, making it possible to consider such aid, by way of derogation and to the extent strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance which has arisen, to be compatible with the common market on the terms specified in this Decision,","{'title': '2000/810/EC: Council Decision of 19 December 2000 on the granting of exceptional national aid by the Government of the French Republic for the distillation of certain wine sector products', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nExceptional aid by the French Government for the distillation of 1000000 hectolitres of wine on French territory:\n\n- totalling EUR 12,2 million, for the amount necessary to bring the price of wine up to EUR 3,7/% vol/hl,\n\nor, should it not prove possible to implement this measure fully from the quota available pursuant to Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999:\n\n- totalling EUR 17,86 million, for the amount necessary to bring the price of wine up to EUR 3,7/% vol/hl, for implementation pursuant to Article 30 of the aforementioned Regulation,\n\nshall be considered to be compatible with the common market.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the French Republic.\n\nDone at Brussels, 19 December 2000.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nJ.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2004/68/EC of 26 April 2004 laying down animal health rules for the importation into and transit through the Community of certain live ungulate animals, amending Directives 90/426/EEC and 92/65/EEC and repealing Directive 72/462/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 6(1), Article 7(e) and Article 13(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2004/68/EC lays down the animal health requirements for the transit through the Union of live ungulates. It provides that specific provisions, including model veterinary certificates, may be laid down for the transit through the Union of live ungulates from authorised third countries, provided that such animals transit the territory of the Union under customs and official veterinary approval and supervision through approved border inspection posts and without any stop on Union territory other than those necessary for animal welfare purposes.
(2) Commission Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 of 12 March 2010 laying down lists of third countries, territories or parts thereof authorised for the introduction into the European Union of certain animals and fresh meat and the veterinary certification requirements (2) lays down the veterinary certification requirements for the introduction into the Union of certain consignments of live animals, including ungulates. Annex I to that Regulation sets out a list of third countries, territories or parts thereof from which such consignments may be introduced into the Union, together with models of veterinary certificates to accompany those consignments.
(3) The requirements for the transit of live bovine animals for breeding and production from the region of Kaliningrad (Kaliningradskaya oblast) through the territory of Lithuania, towards other regions of Russia, currently provide for certification, inter alia, that, prior to movement, the animals had remained in the territory of Kaliningrad since birth or for at least six months before the date of dispatch via the Union and without contact with imported cloven-hoofed animals for the last 30 days.
(4) Russia has requested a revision of those requirements, in order to permit the transit through the territory of Lithuania of live bovine animals for breeding and production originating in the Union but which had been introduced into the region of Kaliningrad, without requiring that they be previously kept for a minimum period in that region.
(5) Taking into account the favourable animal health situation in the Union, it is appropriate to provide for an alternative certification requirement for the transit of such animals from Kaliningrad through the territory of Lithuania, to other parts of the territory of Russia, by means of road vehicles. However, in order to safeguard the animal health status of the Union, such transit should only be permitted where appropriate certification is provided that, following their introduction into Kaliningrad, the animals were kept in facilities where only animals of Union origin were kept.
(6) The model veterinary certificate ‘BOV-X-TRANSIT-RU’, set out in Part 2 of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '8.12.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 336/9', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 1160/2012\nof 7 December 2012\namending Regulation (EU) No 206/2010 as regards the model veterinary certificate for domestic bovine animals intended for transit from the region of Kaliningrad to other regions of Russia via the territory of Lithuania\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2004/68/EC lays down the animal health requirements for the transit through the Union of live ungulates.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 37 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) Articles 32 to 38 of the Treaty provide for the implementation of a common agricultural policy.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 1258/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the financing of the common agricultural policy(3) stipulates that measures intended to provide information on the common agricultural policy are to be financed by the EAGGF Guarantee Section.
(3) The main practical aspects of the present information policy in the common agricultural policy context should be maintained.
(4) Article 22(1) of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(4) stipulates that the implementation of appropriations entered for significant Community action requires a basic act. Under the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 October 1998 on legal bases and implementation of the budget(5), a basic act is also needed for the measures covered by this Regulation.
(5) The common agricultural policy is often misunderstood because of a dearth of information. The only way to rectify this situation is through a consistent, objective and comprehensive information and communication strategy.
(6) The issues surrounding the common agricultural policy and its development should be explained to both farmers and other parties directly concerned, as well as the general public, both inside and outside the Community. Proper implementation of the common agricultural policy depends to a large extent on the explanation given to all protagonists and necessitates the integration of information measures, which are regarded as management components of that policy.
(7) The priority measures which the Community may support should be defined.
(8) Organisations representing those active in farming and in rural areas, particularly farmers' organisations, consumers' associations and environmental protection associations play a vital role in informing their members about the common agricultural policy and relaying to the Commission the opinions of the parties concerned in general and farmers in particular.
(9) Since the common agricultural policy is the first and most extensive of the Community's integrated policies, it should be explained to the general public. Other parties likely to be able to present information projects that will help achieve this goal should therefore be eligible to make proposals.
(10) The Commission must have the necessary resources to implement the information actions it wishes to realise in the area of agriculture.
(11) Although activities that can be assisted under other Community programmes should not be financed under this Regulation, the complementarity of such activities with other Community initiatives should nevertheless be encouraged.
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(6),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 814/2000 of 17 April 2000 on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe Community may finance information measures relating to the common agricultural policy that aim, in particular, at:\n\n(a) helping, on the one hand, to explain and, on the other hand, to implement and develop that policy,\n\n(b) promoting the European model of agriculture and helping people understand it,\n\n(c) informing farmers and other parties active in rural areas,\n\n(d) raising public awareness of the issues and objectives of that policy.\n\nThese actions aim to supply coherent, objective and comprehensive information, both inside and outside the Community, in order to give an overall picture of that policy.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 991/93 of 23 April 1993 extending the measures taken under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the United States of America for the conclusion of the negotiations under GATT Article  XXIV.6 (2), the Community undertook, in respect of the year 1993, to open a quota for imports into Spain of two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum minus the quantities of certain grain substitutes imported into that country during the  same year; whereas the quantities of maize and sorghum imported must be used or processed in Spain; whereas the Community has sole competence for the said Agreement;
Whereas, to ensure that this Agreement is implemented, the extended arrangements provide for direct purchase on the world market or application of a levy reduction system; whereas, however, imports of maize and sorghum into Spain effected on  preferential terms may create difficulties for the Community market; whereas, to overcome that difficulty, provision should be made for the possibility of applying a countervailing duty to processed products exported either to third countries or to the  rest of the Community;
Whereas the cumulation of the advantages provided for under the arrangements established by Regulation (EEC) No 715/90 (3) applicable to imports into the Community of sorghum and maize originating in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States or in  the overseas countries and territories or, on the other hand, pursuant to this Regulation is liable to create disturbances on the Spanish cereals market; whereas that difficulty can be overcome by setting a special reduction of the levy on maize and  sorghum imported under this Regulation;
Whereas provisions are required to cover the operations arising from this Regulation according to the mechanisms laid down by Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 and by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1883/78 of 2 August 1978 laying down general rules for the  financing of interventions by the European Agricultural Guidance Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section (4),","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 3640/93 of 17 December 1993 on special arrangements for imports of maize and sorghum into Spain for the year 1993', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFor 1993 imports from third countries, for free circulation in Spain, of a maximum quantity of two million tonnes of maize and 300 000 tonnes of sorghum shall be effected as provided for in the following Articles.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 111(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, a suckler cow premium may be granted to farmers provided they have kept at their farm a certain number of animals for at least six consecutive months from the day on which the application for the suckler cow premium is lodged. The same obligation applies where Member States pay an additional national suckler cow premium pursuant to Article 111(5) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(2) Spain has informed the Commission that parts of the country undergo an exceptional and lasting drought which is the consequence of a high pluviometric deficit compared to the long run average following an insufficient number of days with significant rainfalls since 1 October 2013. This lasting situation leads to the depletion of pasture lands as well as to the scarcity and/or the weaker quality of available fodder, thus creating an extremely difficult economic situation for farmers, located in the areas affected by the drought, who maintain whole herds under extensive breeding systems and have to respect the retention period provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 111(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009.
(3) This situation has led to an emergency resulting in serious practical and specific problems for farmers holding suckler cows due to increased costs for feeding and watering animals. In order to make it possible for farmers breeding suckler cows located in the areas affected by the drought to continue to cope with their financial commitments without losing their right to receive the suckler cow premiums pursuant to Article 111 of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009, it is therefore appropriate to shorten the length of the retention period referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 111(2) of that Regulation as far as claim year 2014 is concerned.
(4) According to the dates of lodging the applications for the suckler cow premium within the period fixed by Spain, the retention period provided for in Article 111(2) of Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 may end at the earliest on 2 September 2014 and at the latest on 10 December 2014.

Whereas, in order to make the health safeguards offered to the consumer uniform, Directive 64/433/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 83/90/EEC (5), provided for the implementation of health inspections and controls in respect of fresh meat likely to be involved in intra-Community trade;
Whereas, in order to safeguard human and animal health within the Community, Directive 72/462/EEC (6), as last amended by Directive 83/91/EEC (7), provides for health controls to be carried out by the competent authorities of the Member States upon importation of fresh meat and for inspections to be carried out by veterinary experts of the Member States and the Commission within the exporting third countries;
Whereas Directive 64/433/EEC relates only to fresh meat likely to be involved in intra-Community trade; whereas, however, the authorities of the Member States have introduced national controls for fresh meat intended solely for the national market;
Whereas Council Directive 71/118/EEC (8), as last amended by Directive 84/642/EEC (9), makes provision for health inspections and controls for fresh poultrymeat;
Whereas these health inspections and controls give rise to the collection of fees which are at present financed in different ways in the individual Member States; whereas these differences are liable to affect the conditions of competition between lines of production which are for the most part covered by common organizations of the markets;
Whereas, in order to remedy this situation, harmonized rules on the financing of the said health inspections and controls should be laid down;

concerning certain flag State responsibilities for compliance with and enforcement of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 100(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) Union action in the field of maritime transport aims, inter alia, to improve the shipboard living and working conditions of seafarers, security and safety at sea and to prevent pollution caused by maritime accidents.
(2) The Union is aware of the fact that most accidents at sea are directly caused by human factors, especially fatigue.
(3) One of the main objectives of the maritime safety policy of the Union is to eradicate substandard shipping.
(4) On 23 February 2006, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), desiring to create a single, coherent and up-to-date instrument that also embodies the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions, adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC 2006).
(5) According to Article VIII thereof, the MLC 2006 is to come into force 12 months after the date on which there have been registered ratifications by at least 30 Members of the ILO with a total share in the world gross tonnage of ships of 33 %. This condition was fulfilled on 20 August 2012, and MLC 2006 therefore entered into force on 20 August 2013.
(6) Council Decision 2007/431/EC (3) authorised the Member States to ratify MLC 2006, and Member States are urged to do so as soon as possible.
(7) MLC 2006 sets out minimum global standards to ensure the right of all seafarers to decent living and working conditions, irrespective of their nationality and irrespective of the flag of the ships on which they serve, and to establish a level playing field.
(8) Various parts of MLC 2006 have been introduced into different Union instruments both as regards flag State and port State obligations. The aim of this Directive is to introduce certain compliance and enforcement provisions, envisaged in Title 5 of MLC 2006, which relate to those parts of MLC 2006 in respect of which the required compliance and enforcement provisions have not yet been adopted. Those parts correspond to the elements set out in the Annex to Council Directive 2009/13/EC (4).
(9) Directive 2009/13/EC implements the Agreement concluded by the European Community Shipowners’ Associations (ECSA) and the European Transport Workers’ Federation (ETF) on the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (‘the Agreement’), annexed thereto. This Directive is without prejudice to Directive 2009/13/EC and should therefore ensure compliance with more favourable provisions of Union law in conformity with that Directive.
(10) Although Directive 2009/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) governs flag State responsibilities, incorporating the voluntary IMO Member States audit scheme into Union law, and introducing the certification of quality of national maritime authorities, a separate Directive covering the maritime labour standards would be more appropriate and would more clearly reflect the different purposes and procedures, without affecting Directive 2009/21/EC.
(11) Directive 2009/21/EC applies to IMO Conventions. In any event, Member States could develop, implement and maintain a quality management system for the operational parts of the flag State-related activities of their maritime administration falling within the scope of this Directive.
(12) Member States should ensure the effective discharge of their obligations as flag States with respect to the implementation, by ships flying their flag, of the relevant parts of MLC 2006. In establishing an effective system for monitoring mechanisms, including inspections, a Member State could, where appropriate, grant authorisation to public institutions, or to other organisations within the meaning of Regulation 5.1.2 of MLC 2006, under the conditions set out therein.
(13) According to Article 2(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6) the mandate of the European Maritime Safety Agency includes, as a core task, that the Agency should work with the Member States to provide, at the request of a Member State, appropriate information in order to support the monitoring of recognised organisations acting on behalf of that Member State, without prejudice to the rights and obligations of the flag State.
(14) Since the objectives of this Directive cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can rather, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at the level of the Union, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(15) Under no circumstances should the application of this Directive lead to a reduction in the level of protection currently enjoyed by seafarers under Union law,","{'header': '10.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 329/1', 'title': 'DIRECTIVE 2013/54/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 20 November 2013\nconcerning certain flag State responsibilities for compliance with and enforcement of the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Union action in the field of maritime transport aims, inter alia, to improve the shipboard living and working conditions of seafarers, security and safety at sea and to prevent pollution caused by maritime accidents.\n\n((2)) The Union is aware of the fact that most accidents at sea are directly caused by human factors, especially fatigue.\n\n((3)) One of the main objectives of the maritime safety policy of the Union is to eradicate substandard shipping.\n\n((4)) On 23 February 2006, the International Labour Organisation (ILO), desiring to create a single, coherent and up-to-date instrument that also embodies the fundamental principles to be found in other international labour conventions, adopted the Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (MLC 2006).\n\n((5)) According to Article VIII thereof, the MLC 2006 is to come into force 12 months after the date on which there have been registered ratifications by at least 30 Members of the ILO with a total share in the world gross tonnage of ships of 33\xa0%.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 207(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (1),
Whereas:
(1) Since 2000, the Union has granted unlimited duty-free access to the Union market for almost all products originating in the Western Balkan countries. Currently, this system is provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 (2).
(2) All of the Western Balkan countries benefit from preferential trade arrangements, including individual tariff quotas, under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or Interim Agreements on trade and trade-related matters concluded with those countries, with the exception of Kosovo (3).
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 made available a global tariff quota of 50 000 hl for wine, on a ‘first-come, first-served’ basis to all the beneficiaries, subject to the exhaustion of their individual tariff quotas available under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or Interim Agreements.
(4) Stable access to the market of the Union is necessary for the socioeconomic development of Kosovo, which has demonstrated the capacity to export wine. In the absence of an individual tariff quota, Kosovan wine producers lack the necessary predictability for their exports.
(5) It is appropriate to allocate an individual annual tariff quota of 20 000 hl for wine exports from Kosovo to the Union, and to reduce proportionately the global annual tariff quota for wine available to all the beneficiaries from 50 000 hl to 30 000 hl.
(6) The allocation of an individual tariff quota is achieved by closing the existing global tariff quota and opening two new ones, whose total volume is equivalent to the volume of the tariff quota closed.
(7) It is also appropriate to introduce a mechanism which avoids legal uncertainties as regards the tariff quotas available on the date of entry into force of this Regulation, and to prevent the overall volume of the concession from exceeding 50 000 hl.
(8) As the total volume of the concessions is not modified, this Regulation does not affect the wine sector of the Union. The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are also not affected by this Regulation.
(9) This Regulation does not affect the obligations of the Union in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and does not need to receive a WTO waiver.

The specific concessions provided for in the Stabilisation and Association Agreements or the Interim Agreements are also not affected by this Regulation.\n\n((9)) This Regulation does not affect the obligations of the Union in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and does not need to receive a WTO waiver.\n\n((10)) Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Amendments to Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009', 'text': 'Article 1\nAmendments to Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009\nRegulation (EC) No 1215/2009 is amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 7a, paragraphs 2 and 3 are replaced by the following:\n‘2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The power to adopt delegated acts referred to in Article 7 shall be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years from 3 December 2013.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organisation of the market in cereals (1), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13(1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations of prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of each of those Regulations and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex B to Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 or in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 as appropriate.
(3) In accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(4) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(5) Taking into account the settlement between the European Community and the United States of America on Community exports of pasta products to the United States, approved by Council Decision 87/482/EEC (4), it is necessary to differentiate the refund on goods falling within CN codes 1902 11 00 and 1902 19 according to their destination.
(6) Pursuant to Article 4(3) and (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, a reduced rate of export refund has to be fixed, taking account of the amount of the production refund applicable, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1722/93 (5), for the basic product in question, used during the assumed period of manufacture of the goods.
(7) Spirituous beverages are considered less sensitive to the price of the cereals used in their manufacture. However, Protocol 19 to the Act of Accession of the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark provides that the necessary measures must be decided to facilitate the use of Community cereals in the manufacture of spirituous beverages obtained from cereals. Accordingly, it is necessary to adapt the refund rate applying to cereals exported in the form of spirituous beverages.
(8) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 92 (3) (e), 94 and 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 3094/95 of 22 December 1995 on aid to shipbuilding (2) the provisions of Council Directive 90/684/EEC of 21 December 1990 on aid to shipbuilding (3) are applicable to such aid until either the OECD 'Agreement respecting normal competitive conditions in the commercial shipbuilding and repair industry` enters into force or, at the latest, until 31 December 1997;
Whereas the shipbuilding industry is important for the mitigation of structural problems in a number of regions of the Community;
Whereas the direct application of the common maximum ceiling does not allow for the comprehensive restructuring measures necessary in a number of shipyards in these regions and a special transitional arrangement has therefore been introduced;
Whereas it was acknowledged in Directive 92/68/EEC (4) that the shipbuilding industry in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic required urgent and comprehensive restructuring in order to become competitive, a target which has not been fully achieved for two shipyards in the envisaged restructuring period due to unforeseeable circumstances beyond the control of these shipyards;
Whereas in the case of the said two shipyards a further transitional arrangement is needed, in order to enable completion of their restructuring, which will allow them to comply subsequently with the aid rules applicable to the Community as a whole;
Whereas the shipbuilding capacity in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic was reduced to 327 000 compensated gross tonnes (cgt) by 31 December 1995 and whereas the German Government made a commitment to ensure that this capacity limitation is fully respected until at least the end of the year 2000 and to extend this limitation until the end of 2005 unless the Commission authorizes an earlier termination of the capacity limitations;
Whereas a further reduction of shipbuilding capacity in Germany will result from the closure, with respect to new building, of the Bremer Vulkan Werft in Bremen-Vegesack before the end of 1997;
Whereas, in spite of the efforts made by the Greek Government to privatize all its public yards by March 1993, the Hellenic shipyard was only sold in September 1995 to a cooperative of its workers, the State having kept a majority holding of 51 % for defence interests;
Whereas the financial viability and the restructuring of the Hellenic shipyard necessitates the provision of aid which allows the company to write-off the debt accumulated before its delayed privatization;
Whereas a further restructuring of the publicly owned yards in Spain is necessary so that each of these yards, being established as individual profit centres at full cost basis, will achieve financial viability by 31 December 1998;
Whereas under this restructuring plan there will be a capacity reduction in these yards from 240 000 compensated gross registered tonnes (cgrt) to 210 000 (cgrt); whereas this reduction will be supplemented by the non-reopening to shipbuilding of the public yard at Astano (135 000 cgrt capacity), by additional capacity reductions elsewhere in Spain amounting to a further 17 500 cgrt and by not carrying out ship conversions in the shipyard at Astander as long as it remains in public ownership;
Whereas no further aid for restructuring purposes (including loss compensations, loss guarantees and rescue aid) will be made available to the shipyards covered by this Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1013/97 of 2 June 1997 on aid to certain shipyards under restructuring', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

The said amounts comprise the aid to facilitate the further operation of the yards, social aid, contract-related aid under the 'Wettbewerbshilfe` scheme and the aid equivalent of guarantees. For these yards the provisions of Chapter II of Directive 90/684/EEC shall not be applicable during the restructuring period with the exception of Article 4 (6) and (7) of the said Directive, and no other operating aid may be paid for works on contracts or losses in the relevant period.

Whereas Article 10 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, fixes 15 May as the final date applicable to the dates set by Member States for sowing and the submission of applications in respect of cereals;
Whereas, in certain cases, the aforementioned date does not allow sowings of maize and sorghum to be undertaken in suitable conditions; whereas, in accordance with the seventh indent of Article 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, provision should  therefore be made for an additional time limit by which to sow where the weather conditions in certain areas make such a time limit necessary; whereas the said time limit should not, however, compromise the efficiency required of the support system for  producers of arable crops, nor upset the introduction of checks relating to this system; whereas it is therefore appropriate to fix 31 May as the time limit for the areas concerned;
Whereas deferring the sowing date for certain arable crops in certain areas does not constitute sufficient grounds for changing the date laid down for the lodging of 'area' aid applications as referred to in Article 6 (2) of Council Regulation (EEC) No  3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes (3) as amended by Regulation (EC) No 165/94 (4); whereas the procedure whereby producers confirm sowings to the competent  authorities may be implicitly established with a view to simplifying matters;

Those Regulations authorise the use of certain additives. The authorisations are linked to the holder of the authorisation.
(2) In the case of the additives robenidine hydrochloride 66 g/kg (Cycostat 66G) and maduramicin ammonium alpha 1 g/100g (Cygro 1 %) listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 2430/1999 the holder of the authorisation is Roche Vitamins Europe Ltd.

(4) The applicant claims that Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA is the legal successor of the holders of the authorisations referred to in recitals 2 and 3.

(5) The proposed change of the terms of the authorisations is purely administrative in nature and does not entail a fresh assessment of the additives concerned. The European Food Safety Authority was informed of the application.
(6) To allow the applicant to exploit its marketing rights under the name of Alpharma (Belgium) BVBA, it is necessary to change the terms of the authorisations.

 (2) (‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding (‘AS proceeding’ or ‘the proceeding’) with regard to imports into the Union of bioethanol originating in the United States of America (‘USA’ or ‘the country concerned’) following a complaint lodged on 12 October 2011 by the European Producers Union of Renewable Ethanol Association (ePURE) (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing more than 25 % of the total Union production of bioethanol.
A.   PRODUCT CONCERNED
(2) The product concerned by this registration is the same as that defined in the notice of initiation, namely bioethanol, sometimes referred to as ‘fuel ethanol’, i.e. ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), denatured or undenatured, excluding products with a water content of more than 0,3 % (m/m) measured according to the standard EN 15376, as well as ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) contained in blends with gasoline with an ethyl alcohol content of more than 10 % (v/v) originating in the USA, currently falling within CN codes ex 2207 10 00, ex 2207 20 00, ex 2208 90 99, ex 2710 12 11, ex 2710 12 15, ex 2710 12 21, ex 2710 12 25, ex 2710 12 31, ex 2710 12 41, ex 2710 12 45, ex 2710 12 49, ex 2710 12 51, ex 2710 12 59, ex 2710 12 70, ex 2710 12 90, ex 3814 00 10, ex 3814 00 90, ex 3820 00 00 and ex 3824 90 97.
B.   REQUEST
(3) Following the publication of the notice of initiation, the complainant requested in November 2011 that imports of the product concerned be made subject to registration pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. The complainant repeated several times its request for registration of imports of the product concerned, most recently on 3 August 2012, and provided further reasons as to why such registration should be made in the current investigation.
C.   GROUNDS FOR THE REGISTRATION
(4) According to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, the Commission may, after consultation of the Advisory Committee, direct the customs authorities to take the appropriate steps to register imports, so that measures may subsequently be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Imports may be made subject to registration following a request from the Union industry which contains sufficient evidence to justify such action.
(5) The complainant claimed that the product concerned was subsidised and that injury to the Union industry, which is difficult to repair, was caused by the surge in imports benefiting from countervailable subsidies in a relatively short period of time.
(6) The complainant provided evidence that the imports of the product concerned have increased significantly in absolute terms and in terms of market share. The volume and prices of the imported product concerned have had a negative impact on the quantities sold, the level of the prices charged in the Union market and the market share held by the Union industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Union industry.
(7) These findings were confirmed by the Commission in its interim conclusion in the AS proceeding in August 2012, as disclosed to interested parties. Therefore, the request contains sufficient evidence to justify registration.
D.   PROCEDURE
(8) In view of the above, the Commission has concluded that the complainant provided sufficient evidence to make imports of the product concerned subject to registration in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.
(9) All interested parties are invited to make their views known in writing and to provide evidence supporting their views. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
E.   REGISTRATION
(10) Despite positive findings of countervailing subsidisation and material injury caused thereby to the Union industry during the investigation period (‘IP’), namely from 1 October 2010 to 30 September 2011, the Commission decided not to adopt provisional countervailing duties pursuant to Article 12 of the basic Regulation because it was provisionally found that the main subsidy scheme in force during the IP had ceased, in the sense that it no longer conferred a benefit at the time provisional measures would have been imposed. However, there is evidence that the United States might reinstate the main subsidy scheme found to be countervailable in the coming months with retroactive effects. In that event, the Commission considers that it would have been entitled to adopt (and eventually collect) provisional countervailing duties in the present investigation. Thus, in order to preserve the European Union’s rights under these special circumstances, the Commission has decided to proceed as indicated below.
(11) Pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product concerned shall be made subject to registration so that, eventually, measures may retroactively be applied against those imports from the date of such registration. Should the United States reintroduce the main subsidy scheme with retroactive effect, the Commission intends to propose the Council to collect definitive duties on the imports subject to registration. If, at the definitive stage, the Commission is convinced that the United States would not act in the manner as mentioned before, the Commission intends to propose the Council that those imports subject to registration shall not be subject to any additional liability arising from this AS investigation.
(12) Any future liability would emanate from the definitive findings of the anti-subsidy investigation. The estimated amount of possible future liability is set at the level of subsidisation found so far, i.e. at EUR 108 per tonne of pure bioethanol. (3)
(13) In order that the registration is sufficiently effective in view of eventual retroactive levying of an anti-subsidy duty, the declarant should indicate on the customs declaration the proportion in blends, by weight, of the total content of ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (bioethanol content).
F.   PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
(14) Any personal data collected in this anti-subsidy investigation will be treated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (4),","{'header': '24.8.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 229/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 771/2012\nof 23 August 2012\nmaking imports of bioethanol originating in the United States of America subject to registration in application of Article 24(5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 25 November 2011, the European Commission (‘the Commission’) announced by a notice published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2)(‘notice of initiation’), the initiation of an anti-subsidy proceeding (‘AS proceeding’ or ‘the proceeding’) with regard to imports into the Union of bioethanol originating in the United States of America (‘USA’ or ‘the country concerned’) following a complaint lodged on 12 October 2011 by the European Producers Union of Renewable Ethanol Association (ePURE) (‘the complainant’) on behalf of producers representing more than 25\xa0% of the total Union production of bioethanol.', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 597/2009, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Union of bioethanol, sometimes referred to as ‘fuel ethanol’, i.e. ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union), denatured or undenatured, excluding products with a water content of more than 0,3\xa0% (m/m) measured according to the standard EN 15376, as well as ethyl alcohol produced from agricultural products (as listed in Annex I to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) contained in blends with gasoline with an ethyl alcohol content of more than 10\xa0% (v/v) currently falling within CN codes ex\xa02207\xa010\xa000, ex\xa02207\xa020\xa000, ex\xa02208\xa090\xa099, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa011, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa015, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa021, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa025, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa031, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa041, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa045, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa049, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa051, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa059, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa070, ex\xa02710\xa012\xa090, ex\xa03814\xa000\xa010, ex\xa03814\xa000\xa090, ex\xa03820\xa000\xa000 and ex\xa03824\xa090\xa097 (TARIC codes 2207100011, 2207200011, 2208909911, 2710121110, 2710121510, 2270122110, 2710122510, 2710123110, 2710124110, 2710124510, 2710124910, 2710125110, 2710125910, 2710127010, 2710129010, 3814009070, 3820000010 and 3824909767) and originating in the United States of America.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104c (6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Germany,
Whereas the second stage for achieving economic and monetary union started on 1 January 1994; whereas Article 109e (4) of the Treaty lays down that, in the second stage, Member States shall endeavour to avoid excessive government deficits;
Whereas there is an excessive deficit procedure which provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit and, after the excessive deficit has been corrected, for the abrogation of that decision; whereas the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of that procedure; whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (1) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the said Protocol;
Whereas the application of the excessive deficit procedure resulted in a Council Decision of 26 September 1994 that an excessive deficit existed in Germany; whereas the Council decided, on 10 July 1995, to abrogate that Decision;
Whereas Article 104c (5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur; whereas the Commission addressed such an opinion on Germany to the Council in May 1996; whereas according to this opinion:
(a) Germany reported information on its budgetary situation to the Commission by March 1996. Thereupon, the Commission, in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure, provided the statistical data for the application of the said Protocol;
(b) in accordance with Article 104c (3) of the Treaty, the Commission prepared, in April 1996, a report on Germany which takes account of the relevant factors;
(c) in accordance with Article 104c (4) of the Treaty, the Monetary Committee formulated an opinion on the report of the Commission;
(d) the Commission considers that an excessive deficit exists in Germany;
Whereas Article 104c (6) of the Treaty lays down that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before the Council decides, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists; whereas this overall assessment leads to the following conclusions:
Germany has made considerable efforts to cope with the expenditure needs created by unification. The government deficit to GDP ratio was gradually reduced, with the temporary exception of 1993, and stood at 2,5 % of GDP in 1994. However, the decline of the deficit in Germany was reversed in 1995, when the deficit rose to 3,5 % of GDP, only partly due due to weaker growth. The Government deficit was reported by the German Federal Government, in February 1996, to be 3,6 % for 1996. The deficit as forecast by the Commission services for the year 1996 is 3,9 % of GDP. The planned deficit for 1996 is therefore in excess of the Treaty reference value;
Whereas, regarding the medium-term economic and budgetary position of Germany, the evolution of the gross Government debt as a ratio of GDP suggests that the ratio, having reached 58,1 % in 1995, is projected to increase further by several percentage points in 1996;
Whereas Article 3 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure lays down that the governments of the Member States are responsible for the deficits of general government as defined in the first indent of Article 2 of that Protocol;
Whereas a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated, in accordance with the provisions of Article 104c (12) of the Treaty, when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected,","{'title': '96/421/EC: Council Decision of 27 June 1996 on the existence of an excessive deficit in Germany', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nFrom an overall assessment it follows that an excessive deficit exists in Germany.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 27 June 1996.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999 (1), in particular Article 30 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Chapter V of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 lays down procedures for the identification of fishing vessels engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU fishing vessels) as well as procedures for establishing a European Union list of such vessels. Article 37 of that Regulation provides for actions to be taken against fishing vessels included in that list.
(2) The Union list of IUU fishing vessels is set out in Commission Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 (2).
(3) According to Article 30(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, the Union list should comprise fishing vessels included in the IUU vessel lists adopted by regional fisheries management organisations.
(4) According to Article 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008, upon the receipt from regional fisheries management organisations of the lists of fishing vessels presumed or confirmed to be involved in IUU fishing, the Commission shall update the Union list.
(5) The Commission has received the updated lists from the annual meetings of the regional fisheries management organisations.
(6) Considering that the same vessel might be listed under different names and/or flags depending on the time of its inclusion on the regional fisheries management organisations lists, the updated Union list should include the different names and/or flags as established by the respective regional fisheries management organisations.
(7) Regulation (EU) No 468/2010 should therefore be amended accordingly.

(3) It is necessary to lay down the procedures for the application of certain provisions of these Agreements.
(4) These Agreements stipulate that certain products originating in the Republic of Croatia may be imported into the Community, within the limits of tariff quotas, at a reduced or zero rate of customs duty.

(2) Some sectors of industry have established GMP guidelines, while others have not. Consequently, it appears necessary to ensure uniformity among Member States as regards GMP for materials and articles intended to come into contact with food.
(3) In order to ensure such conformity, it is appropriate to lay down certain obligations on business operators.
(4) All business operators should operate an effective quality management of their manufacturing operations which should be adapted to their position in the supply chain.
(5) The rules should apply to materials and articles intended to be brought into contact with food, or already in contact with food and were intended for this purpose, or those which can reasonably be expected to be brought into contact with food or to transfer their constituents to food under normal or foreseeable conditions of use.
(6) The rules on GMP should be applied proportionately to avoid undue burdens for small businesses.
(7) Detailed rules should now be set for processes involving printing inks and should be established for other processes as necessary. For printing inks applied to the non-food contact side of a material or article GMP should in particular ensure that substances are not transferred into food by set-off or transfer through the substrate.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (1), and in particular Article 5(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 12 June 2009 the Commission granted a mandate to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), whose tasks have been assumed by the European Securities and Markets Authority established on 1 January 2011 pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) (2) (ESMA), requesting their advice with regard to the technical assessment of the legal and supervisory framework of Canada in respect of credit rating agencies.
(2) In its advice delivered on 18 April 2012, ESMA suggested that the Canadian legal and supervisory framework in respect of credit rating agencies be considered equivalent to the EU regulatory regime for credit rating agencies.
(3) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, the fulfilment of three conditions needs to be assessed in order to consider a third country legal and supervisory framework equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.
(4) According to the first condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to authorisation or registration and subject to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis. Canada has a comprehensive and legally binding framework in relation to CRAs and the use of credit ratings. National Instrument 25-101 Designated Rating Organizations (DRO) was introduced on 27 January 2012 and became effective from 20 April 2012. This framework requires a credit rating agency to be registered with the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and provides for ongoing supervision of the credit rating agency by the CSA. For the purposes of carrying out its oversight tasks, the CSA is endowed with a wide and comprehensive range of powers. The CSA has the power to require access to books, records and documents kept by credit rating agencies, and to request other relevant information, including telephone records and data traffic. The CSA is also empowered to conduct on-site inspections and inquire into and examine books and records. Moreover, the CSA may bring proceedings against a credit rating agency in the event of a breach of National Instrument 25-101 using any of the powers which are available in the event of a breach of securities’ legislation. Among other powers, the CSA may make an order revoking the designated status of a DRO, impose a fine up to 1 000 000 CAD for each failure to comply with its legal obligations, and require a DRO to rectify any past non-compliance. All CRAs based in Canada were registered as DROs by the CSA on 30 April 2012 and have since then been subject to the CSA’s ongoing supervision. The Ontario Securities Commission which acts as lead supervisor within the CSA intends to conduct on-site inspections at least every two years. The cooperation agreement concluded between ESMA and the CSA provides for information exchange with regard to enforcement and supervisory measures taken against cross border CRAs.
(5) According to the second condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to legally binding rules which are equivalent to those set out in Articles 6 to 12 of and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. The Canadian legal and supervisory framework meets the objectives of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 in respect of the management of conflicts of interest, the organisational processes and procedures that a credit rating agency needs to have in place, the quality of ratings and of rating methodologies, the disclosure of credit ratings and the general and periodic disclosure of credit rating activities. Therefore, the Canadian framework provides for equivalent protection in terms of integrity, transparency, good governance of credit rating agencies and reliability of the credit rating activities.
(6) According to the third condition, the regulatory regime in the third country must prevent interference by the supervisory authorities and other public authorities of that third country with the content of credit ratings and methodologies. In this respect, Section B of Appendix A to National Instrument 25-101 requires credit rating agencies to establish a committee responsible for implementing a rigorous and formal process for issuing and reviewing the methodologies, models and key rating assumptions they use. Neither the CSA nor any other public authority is empowered to interfere in this process or with the content of credit ratings, or rating methodologies.
(7) In view of the factors examined, the conditions laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 can be considered to be met by the Canadian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies. Therefore, the Canadian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies should be considered equivalent to the legal and supervisory framework established by Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009. The Commission, in cooperation with ESMA, will continue monitoring the evolution of the Canadian legal and supervisory framework for credit rating agencies and the fulfilment of the conditions on the basis of which this decision has been taken.
(8) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the European Securities Committee,","{'header': '12.10.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 278/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 5 October 2012\non the recognition of the legal and supervisory framework of Canada as equivalent to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on credit rating agencies\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2012/630/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 12 June 2009 the Commission granted a mandate to the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR), whose tasks have been assumed by the European Securities and Markets Authority established on 1 January 2011 pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 November 2010 establishing a European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority)(2)(ESMA), requesting their advice with regard to the technical assessment of the legal and supervisory framework of Canada in respect of credit rating agencies.\n\n((2)) In its advice delivered on 18 April 2012, ESMA suggested that the Canadian legal and supervisory framework in respect of credit rating agencies be considered equivalent to the EU regulatory regime for credit rating agencies.\n\n((3)) Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009, the fulfilment of three conditions needs to be assessed in order to consider a third country legal and supervisory framework equivalent to Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009.\n\n((4)) According to the first condition, credit rating agencies in the third country must be subject to authorisation or registration and subject to effective supervision and enforcement on an ongoing basis. Canada has a comprehensive and legally binding framework in relation to CRAs and the use of credit ratings. National Instrument 25-101 Designated Rating Organizations (DRO) was introduced on 27 January 2012 and became effective from 20 April 2012. This framework requires a credit rating agency to be registered with the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) and provides for ongoing supervision of the credit rating agency by the CSA. For the purposes of carrying out its oversight tasks, the CSA is endowed with a wide and comprehensive range of powers. The CSA has the power to require access to books, records and documents kept by credit rating agencies, and to request other relevant information, including telephone records and data traffic. The CSA is also empowered to conduct on-site inspections and inquire into and examine books and records. Moreover, the CSA may bring proceedings against a credit rating agency in the event of a breach of National Instrument 25-101 using any of the powers which are available in the event of a breach of securities’ legislation. Among other powers, the CSA may make an order revoking the designated status of a DRO, impose a fine up to 1\xa0000\xa0000 CAD for each failure to comply with its legal obligations, and require a DRO to rectify any past non-compliance. All CRAs based in Canada were registered as DROs by the CSA on 30 April 2012 and have since then been subject to the CSA’s ongoing supervision. The Ontario Securities Commission which acts as lead supervisor within the CSA intends to conduct on-site inspections at least every two years.

(2003/3/EC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EC(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 3(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Article 3(1) of Directive 1999/32/EC Member States are required to take all necessary steps to ensure that as from 1 January 2003 within their territory heavy fuel oils are not used if their sulphur content exceeds 1 % by mass.
(2) Pursuant to Article 3(2), of that directive a Member State may, under certain conditions, authorise heavy fuel oils with a sulphur content of between 1 % and 3 % by mass to be used in part or the whole of its territory.
(3) Greece applied on 17 December 2001 for the Commission's approval for the authorisation of the use of heavy fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of 3 % by mass in the whole of its territory, except for the Attica Basin. Greece states that a maximum sulphur content of 3 % by mass is 10 % lower than that of the heavy fuel oil currently in use.
(4) The Commission requested additional information from the Greek authorities on 23 January 2002. Greece submitted this information on 19 February 2002 and subsequently revised its request on 4 June 2002 to seek a time-limited derogation until 2008 with a review for the remaining period.
(5) Greece provided data stating that the relevant Community ambient air quality standards for sulphur dioxide set down in Council Directive 80/779/EEC of 15 July 1980 on air quality limit values and guide values for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates(2) and Council Directive 1999/30/EC of 22 April 1999 relating to limit values for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead in ambient air(3), as amended by Commission Decision 2001/744/EC(4), are complied with. In addition, on the basis of indicative measurements taken at three representative points, which coincide with ecosystem zones, concentrations for sulphur dioxide in ambient air are below the 20 Îźg/m3-limit value for the protection of ecosystems set out in Directive 1999/30/EC. Greece states that in general concentrations of sulphur dioxides in ambient air within its territory are low, nevertheless, in areas surrounding major thermal stations powered with lignite concentrations are higher. However, measurements provided by Greece, from monitoring stations several kilometres from the lignite-powered stations are within the relevant limit values set out in Directive 80/779/EEC as amended by Directive 89/427/EEC(5).
(6) Greece states that emissions of sulphur dioxide presently amount to approximately 483000 tonnes per annum. However, the level of emissions is expected to fall to 300000 tonnes per annum due to increasing use of natural gas in the thermal power generation sector and due to measures that will be required to comply with Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2001 on the limitation of emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants(6).
(7) Greece states that while it makes virtually no contribution to the deposition of sulphur or the critical loads for acidity being exceeded in other Member States, it acknowledges that it contributes 1 % of the sulphur deposition in Italy.
(8) The Commission requested the help of the cooperative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP), which conducted a more detailed analysis of the Greek contribution to sulphur deposition, in particular in Italy, where critical loads for acidity are exceeded in 5 % of the ecosystems that are sensitive to acidification.
(9) The results of this analysis by EMEP, contained in reports of 22 February and 22 March 2002 show that approximately 57 % of the Greek sulphur dioxide emissions originate outside the Attica Basin and that the geographical area affected by these emissions extends over the whole of Europe as a consequence of the long range transport.
(10) In the case of Italy, the EMEP analysis shows that Greek emissions contribute to critical loads for acidity being exceeded in at least six grid squares where exceedances of critical loads were established. In those grid squares the contribution from Greece does not exceed 0,5 %. EMEP concludes that this analysis is in agreement with calculations that assign 1 % of the total sulphur deposition in Italy to Greece.
(11) On 5 July 2002, the Greek authorities announced that the already submitted notification was incomplete and that additional information would be submitted by the end of July. By letter of 15 July 2002, the Commission took note of the above and requested the Greek authorities to provide the announced information as soon as possible, indicating that the period of six months set up in Article 3(5) of the Directive would start to run when such information was received.
(12) On 30 July 2002 the Greek authorities submitted data on sulphur dioxide emissions in Greece for the year 2000 and suggested that the Greek request should be examined on the basis of this data. On 3 October 2002, they also submitted a recent assessment of the protection level of ecosystems in Italy with a view to the Greek contribution to exceedance of critical loads for acidity.
(13) The Commission requested EMEP to evaluate the additional information provided by Greece on 30 July and 3 October 2002, respectively. Supported by the Coordination Centre for Effects on Mapping of Critical Levels and Loads (CCE) EMEP confirmed the former conclusion that Greek emissions of sulphur dioxide as reported by Greece for the year 2000 contribute to the exceedance of critical loads for acidity in Italy. The results are summarised in a report of 19 November 2002, according to which it is substantiated beyond any reasonable doubt that Greek emissions do contribute to excess deposition above the critical loads for acidification in other Member States, particularly Italy.
(14) In light of the information provided by Greece on ambient air quality and the analysis conducted by EMEP supported by CCE on the Greek contribution to critical loads being exceeded, the Commission considers that the condition, as adopted by the Council, regarding critical load exceedance, that must be complied with for a Member State to be permitted to authorise the use of heavy fuel oils with a sulphur content of between 1 % and 3 % by mass in part or the whole of its territory, is not met and therefore the Commission cannot grant the derogation requested by Greece.

Proof of origin: The seeds and seedlings are produced and selected by local farmers, in seedbeds registered with, and under the control of, the regulatory body and are kept in nurseries situated in the production area. The propagating material is produced under the control of the regulatory body. The asparagus fields are located in the production area and entered in a special register. Cultivation techniques, harvesting and transport to the packing stations are all under the control of the regulatory body, the latter also being responsible for supervising the packaging of fresh asparagus and the processing of processed asparagus.\n\n4.5. Method of production: After being selected by registered stations, shoots of native asparagus plants are packed in the fresh state in homogeneous bundles of 0,5, 1 or 2 kg and placed in suitable crates for transportation.\n\nWhen asparagus is intended for sale as a preserved product the shoots undergo an industrial process whereby: the stems are washed, cut according to the size of the container (about half-way up), cooked, cleaned, graded, and placed in containers; liquid is added, the containers are preheated and sealed, sterilised, refrigerated, etc. The entire process is under the control of the regulatory body.\n\n4.6. Link: Asparagus was first cultivated by the ancient Romans.

Asparagus is grown at an altitude of 450 to 650 metres. The soil consists of heavy or medium or, in some cases, light loam, with a pH between 7,8 and 8,4 and a carbonate content, expressed in calcium carbonate, exceeding 40 %, a high potassium and magnesium content due to the dolomitic nature of the carbonates present, and low levels of assimilable phosphorus and organic matter. The high magnesium and low phosphorus content is conductive to strong pigmentation of the shoot, the stem being a deeper green and the head more purple. The high potassium content inhibits sprouting of the head. Continental Mediterranean climate with an average temperature of 16,3.oC, average annual rainfall of the order of 350 mm and light winds. The cultivation techniques, work carried out, and pest and disease control provide ideal conditions for growing asparagus with characteristics linked to its environment.\n\n4.7.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 of 6 October 1997 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1973/2002(2), (the basic Regulation), and in particular Article 23(2) and Article 24(3) and (5) thereof,
After having consulted the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. REQUEST
(1) The Commission has received a request pursuant to Article 23(2) of the basic Regulation to investigate the possible circumvention of the countervailing measures imposed on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film (PET film) originating in India.
(2) The request was lodged on 6 January 2004 by the following Community producers: DuPont Teijin Films, Mitsubishi Polyester Film GmbH and Nuroll SpA.
B. PRODUCT
(3) The product concerned by the possible circumvention is PET film originating in India, normally declared under CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (the product concerned). These codes are given for information only.
(4) The product under investigation is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Brazil and from Israel (the product under investigation) normally declared under the same codes as the product concerned.
C. EXISTING MEASURES
(5) The measures currently in force and possibly being circumvented are countervailing measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999(3).
D. GROUNDS
(6) The request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the countervailing measures on imports of PET film originating in India are being circumvented by means of transhipment via Brazil and via Israel.
(7) The evidence submitted is as follows:
The request shows that a significant change in the pattern of trade involving exports from India, Brazil and Israel to the Community has taken place following the imposition of measures on the product concerned, and that there appears to be insufficient due cause or justification other than the imposition of the duty for such a change. This change in the pattern of trade appears to stem from the transhipment of PET film originating in India via Brazil and via Israel.
(8) Furthermore, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the remedial effects of the existing countervailing measures on the product concerned are being undermined in terms of quantities. Significant volumes of imports of PET film from Brazil and from Israel appear to have replaced imports of the product concerned originating in India.
(9) Finally, the request contains sufficient prima facie evidence that the imported PET film still benefits from the subsidies as established in the original investigation.
(10) Should circumvention practices covered by Article 23 of the basic Regulation, other than transhipment, be identified in the course of the investigation, the investigation may cover these practices also.
E. PROCEDURE
(11) In the light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 23 of the basic Regulation and to make imports of PET film consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.
(a) Questionnaires
(12) In order to obtain the information it deems necessary for its investigation, the Commission will send questionnaires to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in Brazil and Israel, to the exporters/producers and to the associations of exporters/producers in India, to the importers and to the associations of importers in the Community which cooperated in the investigation that led to the existing measures or which are listed in the request, and to the authorities of India, Brazil and Israel. Information, as appropriate, may also be sought from the Community industry.
(13) In any event, all interested parties should contact the Commission forthwith, but not later than the time limit set in Article 3 of this Regulation in order to find out whether they are listed in the request and, if necessary, request a questionnaire within the time limit set in Article 3(1) of this Regulation, given that the time limit set in Article 3(2) of this Regulation applies to all interested parties.
(14) The authorities of India, Brazil and Israel will be notified of the initiation of the investigation and provided with a copy of the request.
(b) Collection of information and holding of hearings
(15) All interested parties are hereby invited to make their views known in writing and to provide supporting evidence. Furthermore, the Commission may hear interested parties, provided that they make a request in writing and show that there are particular reasons why they should be heard.
(c) Exemption from registration of imports or measures
(16) In accordance with Article 23(3) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation may be exempted from registration or measures if the importation does not constitute circumvention.
(17) The possible circumvention takes place outside the Community. Article 23 of the basic Regulation is aiming at countering circumvention practices without affecting operators which can prove that they are not involved in such practices, but it does not contain a specific provision providing for the treatment of producers in the countries concerned which could establish that they are not involved in circumvention practices. Therefore, it appears necessary to introduce a possibility for producers concerned to request an exemption from the registration of imports of their exported products or from measures on these imports.
(18) Producers wishing to obtain an exemption should apply for it and submit any requested questionnaire reply within the appropriate time limits, in order for it to be established that they are not circumventing the countervailing duties within the meaning of Article 23(1) of the basic Regulation. Importers could still benefit from exemption from registration or measures to the extent that their imports are from producers which are granted such an exemption, and in accordance with Article 23(3) of the basic Regulation.
F. REGISTRATION
(19) Pursuant to Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation, imports of the product under investigation should be made subject to registration in order to ensure that, should the investigation result in findings of circumvention, countervailing duties of an appropriate amount can be levied retroactively from the date of registration of such imports consigned from Brazil and from Israel.
G. TIME LIMITS
(20) In the interest of sound administration, time limits should be stated within which:
- interested parties may make themselves known to the Commission, present their views in writing and submit questionnaire replies or any other information to be taken into account during the investigation,
- interested parties may make a written request to be heard by the Commission.
(21) Attention is drawn to the fact that the exercise of most procedural rights set out in the basic Regulation depends on the party's making itself known within the time limits mentioned in Article 3 of this Regulation.
H. NON-COOPERATION
(22) In cases in which any interested party refuses access to or otherwise does not provide necessary information within the time limits, or significantly impedes the investigation, findings, affirmative or negative, may be made in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation, on the basis of the facts available.
(23) Where it is found that any interested party has supplied false or misleading information, the information shall be disregarded and use may be made, in accordance with Article 28 of the basic Regulation, of the facts available. If an interested party does not cooperate, or cooperates only partially, and use of the facts available is made, the result may be less favourable than if it had cooperated,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 283/2004 of 18 February 2004 initiating an investigation concerning the possible circumvention of countervailing measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film originating in India by imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether declared as originating in Brazil or Israel or not and making such imports subject to registration', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAn investigation is hereby initiated pursuant to Article 23(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, in order to determine if imports into the Community of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, falling within CN codes ex 3920 62 19 and ex 3920 62 90 (TARIC codes 3920 62 19 01, 3920 62 19 04, 3920 62 19 07, 3920 62 19 11, 3920 62 19 14, 3920 62 19 17, 3920 62 19 21, 3920 62 19 24, 3920 62 19 27, 3920 62 19 31, 3920 62 19 34, 3920 62 19 37, 3920 62 19 41, 3920 62 19 44, 3920 62 19 47, 3920 62 19 51, 3920 62 19 54, 3920 62 19 57, 3920 62 19 61, 3920 62 19 67, 3920 62 19 74, 3920 62 19 92, 3920 62 90 31, 3920 62 90 92 ), consigned from Brazil and from Israel, whether originating in Brazil or Israel or not, are circumventing the measures imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 2597/1999 on imports of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, originating in India.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe Customs authorities are hereby directed, pursuant to Article 23(2) and Article 24(5) of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97, to take the appropriate steps to register the imports into the Community identified in Article 1 of this Regulation.\n\nRegistration shall expire nine months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation.\n\nThe Commission, by regulation, may direct Customs authorities to cease registration in respect of imports into the Community of products manufactured by producers having applied for an exemption of registration and having been found not to be circumventing the countervailing duties.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

(2) The Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin (2) (‘the Convention’) lays down provisions on the origin of goods traded under relevant Agreements concluded between the Contracting Parties. Serbia and other participants to the Stabilisation and Association Process from the Western Balkans were invited to join the system of pan-European diagonal cumulation of origin in the Thessaloniki agenda, endorsed by the European Council of June 2003.

(3) The Union and Serbia signed the Convention on 15 June 2011 and 12 November 2012, respectively.
(4) The Union and Serbia deposited their instruments of acceptance with the depositary of the Convention on 26 March 2012 and 1 July 2013, respectively. As a consequence, in application of Article 10(3) of the Convention, the Convention entered into force in relation to the Union and Serbia on 1 May 2012 and on 1 September 2013, respectively.
(5) Article 6 of the Convention provides that each Contracting Party is to take appropriate measures to ensure that the Convention is effectively applied. To that effect, the Stabilisation and Association Council established by the Agreement should adopt a decision replacing Protocol 3 by a new protocol which, with regard to the rules of origin, refers to the Convention.

Whereas the application of intervention measures in respect of beef has resulted in a build-up of stocks in several Member States; whereas outlets for these products exist in certain third countries; whereas, in order to prevent storage being prolonged excessively, part of these stocks should be sold by tendering procedure for export to those countries; whereas to permit the sale of meat of uniform quality, beef should be sold that was purchased under Article 6(b) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68;

Whereas, for practical reasons, export refunds will not be granted in respect of beef sold under this Regulation; whereas, however, successful tenderers will be required to apply for export licences for the quantity allocated, in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector (7), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 759/98 (8);
Whereas, in order to ensure that the beef sold is exported to the eligible third countries, provision should be made for a security to be lodged before the goods are taken over and the primary requirements should be determined;

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.
(5) However, in fixing the rate of refund it would seem advisable to base it at this time on the difference in the cost of raw inputs widely used in compound feedingstuffs as the Community and world markets, allowing more accurate account to be taken of the commercial conditions under which such products are exported.
(6) The refund must be fixed once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1962/2002 of 31 October 2002 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the compound feedingstuffs covered by Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and subject to Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 are hereby fixed as shown in the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 November 2002.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 October 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 181, 1.7.1992, p. 21.\n\n(2) OJ L 193, 29.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 147, 30.6.1995, p. 51.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 October 2002 fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe other destinations are as follows:\n\nC10 All destinations except for Estonia.'}]}"

(2010/710/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By letters registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 3 August 2007, 23 December 2009 and 17 February 2010 respectively Italy, Germany and Austria requested authorisation to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the person liable for payment of value added tax (hereinafter ‘VAT’). By letter registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 10 February 2010, the United Kingdom requested to extend the period of validity of the authorisation provided for by Council Decision 2007/250/EC of 16 April 2007 authorising the United Kingdom to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax (2).
(2) The Commission informed the other Member States by letter dated 11 January 2010 of the request made by Germany, and by letter dated 9 March 2010 of the requests made by Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom. The Commission informed Germany by letter dated 12 January 2010 and Italy, Austria and the United Kingdom, by letters dated 11 March 2010, that it had all the information it considered necessary for the appraisal of the requests.
(3) The person liable for the payment of VAT pursuant to Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC is the taxable person supplying the goods. The purpose of the derogations requested by Germany, Italy and Austria is to place that liability on the taxable person to whom the supplies are made, but only under certain conditions and only in relation to particular products, notably mobile telephones and integrated circuit devices.
(4) A significant number of traders in particular products, notably mobile telephones and integrated circuit devices, evade paying VAT to the tax authorities after selling their products. Their customers, however, are entitled to a tax deduction as they are in possession of a valid invoice. In the most aggressive cases of such tax evasion the same goods are, via a ‘carousel’ scheme, supplied several times without payment of VAT to the tax authorities. By designating the person to whom the goods are supplied as the person liable for the payment of VAT in such cases, the derogation would eliminate the opportunity to engage in that form of tax evasion. It would not affect the amount of VAT due.
(5) For the purposes of ensuring the effective operation of the derogation and preventing tax evasion from being shifted to other products or towards the retail level, Germany, Italy and Austria should introduce appropriate control and reporting obligations. The Commission should be informed of the specific measures adopted in view of monitoring the operation of the derogation.
(6) The measure is proportionate to the objectives pursued since it is not intended to apply generally, but only to specific groups of products, where there is a high risk of tax evasion and where the scale of tax evasion has resulted in considerable tax losses. Moreover, the use of a reverse charge mechanism implies less risk of shifting of fraud towards the retail trade of the products in question, as mobile phones are generally supplied by large phone companies and as the measure is applicable to integrated circuits in a state prior to integration into end-user products.
(7) In principle, the authorisation shall be valid only for a short period, because it cannot be established with certainty that the objectives of the measure will be achieved nor can the impact of the measure on the functioning of the VAT systems within those Member States who apply it, or in other Member States, be gauged in advance.
(8) The United Kingdom should be allowed to continue to apply its existing special measure until the date of expiry of the authorisations granted to Germany, Italy and Austria.
(9) The derogation has no negative impact on the Union’s own resources accruing from VAT,","{'header': '25.11.2010 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 309/5', 'title': 'COUNCIL IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 22 November 2010\nauthorising Germany, Italy and Austria to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC and amending Decision 2007/250/EC to extend the period of validity of the authorisation granted to the United Kingdom\n(2010/710/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By letters registered with the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 3 August 2007, 23 December 2009 and 17 February 2010 respectively Italy, Germany and Austria requested authorisation to introduce a special measure derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC as regards the person liable for payment of value added tax (hereinafter ‘VAT’).

Moreover, the use of a reverse charge mechanism implies less risk of shifting of fraud towards the retail trade of the products in question, as mobile phones are generally supplied by large phone companies and as the measure is applicable to integrated circuits in a state prior to integration into end-user products.\n\n((7)) In principle, the authorisation shall be valid only for a short period, because it cannot be established with certainty that the objectives of the measure will be achieved nor can the impact of the measure on the functioning of the VAT systems within those Member States who apply it, or in other Member States, be gauged in advance.\n\n((8)) The United Kingdom should be allowed to continue to apply its existing special measure until the date of expiry of the authorisations granted to Germany, Italy and Austria.\n\n((9)) The derogation has no negative impact on the Union’s own resources accruing from VAT,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Germany is authorised to designate the taxable person to whom supplies of the following goods are made as the person liable to pay VAT:\n(a)\nmobile telephones, being devices made or adapted for use in connection with a licensed network and operated on specified frequencies, whether or not they have any other use;\n(b)\nintegrated circuit devices such as microprocessors and central processing units in a state prior to integration into end-user products.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The derogation shall apply in respect of supplies of goods for which the taxable amount is equal to or higher than EUR\xa05\xa0000.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nBy way of derogation from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Italy is authorised to designate the taxable person to whom supplies of the following goods are made as the person liable to pay VAT:\n(a)\nmobile telephones, being devices made or adapted for use in connection with a licensed network and operated on specified frequencies, whether or not they have any other use;\n(b)\nintegrated circuit devices such as microprocessors and central processing units in a state prior to integration into end-user products.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0By way of derogation from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, Austria is authorised to designate the taxable person to whom supplies of the following goods are made as the person liable to pay VAT:\n(a)\nmobile telephones, being devices made or adapted for use in connection with a licensed network and operated on specified frequencies, whether or not they have any other use;\n(b)\nintegrated circuit devices such as microprocessors and central processing units in a state prior to integration into end-user products.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The derogation shall apply in respect of supplies of goods for which the taxable amount is equal to or higher than EUR\xa05\xa0000.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThe derogation provided for in Articles 1, 2 and 3 is subject to Germany, Italy and Austria introducing appropriate and effective control and reporting obligations on taxable persons who supply goods to which the reverse charge applies in accordance with this Decision.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\nArticle 4 of Decision 2007/250/EC is replaced by the following:\n‘Article 4\nThis Decision shall expire on the date of entry into force of the Union rules allowing all Member States to adopt such measures derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, but on 31 December 2013 at the latest.’.'}, {'id': '6', 'title': 'Article 6', 'text': 'Article 6\nThis Decision shall take effect on the day of its notification.\nThis Decision shall expire on the date of entry into force of the Union rules allowing all Member States to adopt such measures derogating from Article 193 of Directive 2006/112/EC, but on 31 December 2013 at the latest.'}, {'id': '7', 'title': 'Article 7', 'text': 'Article 7\nThis Decision is addressed to the Federal Republic of Germany, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Austria, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.

(2012/427/EU)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC (1), and in particular Article 18(6) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 98/70/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 1998 relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels (2) as amended by the Directive 2009/30/EC (3), and in particular Article 7c(6) thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee established by Article 25, paragraph 2 of Directive 2009/28/EC,
Whereas:
(1) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC both lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels. Provisions of Articles 7b and 7c and Annex IV to Directive 98/70/EC are similar to provisions of Articles 17 and 18 and Annex V to Directive 2009/28/EC.
(2) Where biofuels and bioliquids are to be taken into account for the purposes referred to in Article 17(1)(a), (b) and (c) of Directive 2009/28/EC, Member States should require economic operators to show the compliance of biofuels and bioliquids with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(2) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC.
(3) Recital 76 of Directive 2009/28/EC states that the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry should be avoided and voluntary schemes can help create efficient solutions for proving compliance with these sustainability criteria.
(4) The Commission may decide that a voluntary national or international scheme demonstrates that consignments of biofuel comply with the sustainability criteria set out in Article 17(3) to (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC or that a voluntary national or international scheme to measure greenhouse gas emission savings contains accurate data for the purposes of Article 17(2) of this Directive.
(5) The Commission may recognise such a voluntary scheme for a period of five years.
(6) When an economic operator provides proof or data obtained in accordance with a voluntary scheme that has been recognised by the Commission, to the extent covered by the recognition decision, a Member State should not require the supplier to provide further evidence of compliance with the sustainability criteria.
(7) The ‘Scottish Quality Farm Assured Combinable Crops Limited’ scheme was submitted on 27 March 2012 to the Commission with the request for recognition. This scheme covers winter wheat, maize and oil seed rape produced in the North of Great Britain up to the first point of delivery of these crops. The recognised scheme should be made available at the transparency platform established under Directive 2009/28/EC. The Commission should take into account considerations of commercial sensitivity and may decide to only partially publish the scheme.
(8) Assessment of the ‘Scottish Quality Farm Assured Combinable Crops Limited’ scheme found it to adequately cover the sustainability criteria in Article 7b(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(3), (4) and (5) of Directive 2009/28/EC, as well as applying up to the first point of delivery of these crops a mass balance methodology in line with the requirements of Article 7c(1) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 18(1) of Directive 2009/28/EC. The scheme gives accurate data on two elements necessary for the purposes of Article 7b(2) of Directive 98/70/EC and Article 17(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC, in particular, the geographic area the crops come from and the annualised emissions from carbon stock changes caused by land-use change. A small percentage of members of the scheme do not cover the sustainability criteria for part of their land. The scheme indicates the status of full or partial compliance of the land of its members in its online member checker database and shows compliance of consignments with the sustainability criteria on the Scottish Quality Crops passport.
(9) The evaluation of the ‘Scottish Quality Farm Assured Combinable Crops Limited’ scheme found that it meets adequate standards of reliability, transparency and independent auditing.
(10) Any additional sustainability elements covered by the ‘Scottish Quality Farm Assured Combinable Crops Limited’ scheme are not part of the consideration of this Decision. These additional sustainability elements are not mandatory to show compliance with sustainability requirements provided for by Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC,","{'header': '25.7.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 198/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 24 July 2012\non recognition of the ‘Scottish Quality Farm Assured Combinable Crops Limited’ scheme for demonstrating compliance with the sustainability criteria under Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(2012/427/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directives 98/70/EC and 2009/28/EC both lay down sustainability criteria for biofuels.

Having regard to the Act of Accession of Greece,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 10/81 of 1 January 1981 fixing, in respect of fruit and vegetables, the general rules for implementing the 1979 Act of Accession (1), and in particular Article 9 (1) thereof,
Whereas Article 75 of the Act of Accession introduces a compensatory mechanism on import into the Member States other than Greece for fruit and vegetables coming from Greece for which an institutional price is fixed;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 75 (2) (a) of the Act of Accession, a Community offer price is to be calculated annually, on the one hand, on the basis of the arithmetical average of producer prices of each Member State other than Greece, increased by the transport and packaging costs borne by the products from the areas of production up to the representative centres of Community consumption and, on the other hand, taking into account the trend of production costs in the fruit and vegetables sector; whereas the said producer prices are to correspond to an average of the price quotations recorded over three years prior to fixing the Community offer price; whereas, however, the annual Community offer price may not exceed the level of the reference price applied vis-Ă -vis third countries, this Community offer price being reduced by 15 % at the time of the fifth move toward price alignment referred to in Article 59 of the Act;
Whereas, in order to take account of seasonal price variations, the marketing year should be split into several periods and a Community offer price fixed for each such period;
Whereas, by virtue of Article 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 10/81, the rates used to calculate production prices are those recorded for an indigenous product whose trade characteristics are defined, on the representative market or markets within the production zones where the rates are lowest, for the products or varieties which represent a substantial proportion of marketable production throughout the year or during a part of the year and which correspond to quality category I and to set conditions in respect of packaging; whereas the average rate for each representative market is to be drawn up disregarding rates which may be considered excessively high or low compared with the normal fluctuations recorded on the said market;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (1), and in particular Article 53(1)(b)(ii) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) defines amongst others maximum residue levels (MRLs )for amitraz and its metabolites.
(2) The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASSF) has been notified on repeated occasions in 2007, 2008 and 2009 that pears originating from Turkey were found with levels of amitraz exceeding the Acute Reference Dose (ARfD) for this pesticide. The latest information received from the German authorities on 21 October 2009, indicated that in the most recent analysis amitraz was found at levels that largely exceeded the ARfD.
(3) Given the high level of risk to which European consumers may be exposed, Member States should control at least 10 percent of consignments of pears originating from Turkey for the presence of amitraz at import. Consignments already on the market should also be subject to official controls.
(4) Member States should inform the Commission of all testing results. Unfavourable results should be reported through RASFF.
(5) Commission Regulation (EC) No 669/2009 of 24 July 2009 implementing Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the increased level of official controls on imports of certain feed and food of non-animal origin and amending Decision 2006/504/EC (3) requires Member States to carry out an increased level of controls at import on pears originating from Turkey, for the purposes of verifying the presence of amitraz on 10 % of all consignments of that commodity. As the control measure in question will be applicable as from 25 January 2010, it is appropriate to establish a duration of the measures laid down in this decision so as to avoid overlaps with the control measures laid down in Regulation (EC) No 669/2009.
(6) Article 53 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 provides for the possibility to adopt appropriate Community emergency measures for food and feed imported from a third country in order to protect human health, animal health or the environment, where the risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by means of measures taken by the Member States individually.
(7) Given the urgency it is appropriate to adopt these emergency measures in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 53(1) of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market(1), as last amended by Directive 2002/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(2), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2002/99/EC of 16 December 2002 laying down the animal health rules governing the production, processing, distribution and introduction of products of animal origin for human consumption(3), and in particular Article 4(1) and (3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Since 28 February 2003 the Netherlands have declared several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(2) The infection with avian influenza subtype H7N7 has affected several poultry flocks in an area called ""Gelderse Vallei"".
(3) Avian influenza is a highly contagious poultry disease that can pose a serious threat for the poultry industry.
(4) In view of the high mortality and the rapid spread of the infection the Netherlands took immediate action as provided for by Council Directive 92/40/EEC(4) of 19 May 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza, as amended by the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, before the disease was officially confirmed.
(5) Council Directive 92/40/EEC sets out the minimum control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of avian influenza. The Member State may take more stringent action in the field covered by this Directive if deemed necessary and proportionate to contain the disease, taking into account the particular epidemiological, animal husbandry, commercial and social conditions prevailing.
(6) Furthermore, all movements of live poultry and hatching eggs within the Netherlands and their dispatch to other Member States was prohibited.
(7) The same prohibitions should apply to exports to third countries in order to protect their health status and to prevent the risk of re-entry of such consignments in another Member State.
(8) For the sake of clarity and transparency the Commission has taken Decision 2003/153/EC(5) of 3 March 2003 concerning protection measures in relation to strong suspicion of avian influenza in the Netherlands, as amended by Decision 2003/156/EC(6), after consultation with the Dutch authorities, thereby reinforcing the measures taken by the Netherlands and granting certain specific derogations for movements of slaughter poultry and day-old chicks within the Netherlands.
(9) By Commission Decisions 2003/156/EC, 2003/172/EC(7), 2003/186/EC(8) and 2003/191/EC(9) the measures provided for in Decision 2003/153/EC were prolonged in view of the evolution of the disease and amended as necessary.
(10) The currently available epidemiological information and the first results of the surveillance programme, carried out nation-wide in the Netherlands, suggest that the occurrence of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus appears to be restricted in the ""Gelderse Vallei"".
(11) In the light of the evolution of the disease, it is appropriate to further prolong the measures adopted under Decision 2003/191/EC. However, a derogation should also be provided for the dispatch of day-old chicks from the Netherlands to other Member States under certain conditions, unless they are originating from hatcheries or holdings within the established surveillance zones. For this purpose, additional certification requirements should be provided for.
(12) Furthermore, movements of rearing turkeys within the Netherlands but outside the restricted zones, and movements of hatching eggs within the restricted zones, should be authorised under official control.
(13) Fresh poultrymeat destined for intra-Community trade has to be marked with a health mark in accordance with the health mark foreseen in Chapter XII of Annex I of Directive 71/118/EEC(10), as last amended by Council Directive 97/79/EC(11). In order to allow the marketing on the Dutch market of fresh poultrymeat obtained from poultry originating from the established surveillance zones special provisions for its health marking shall be laid down.
(14) Having evaluated the situation in close cooperation with the Dutch authorities in order to protect the Community poultry population and to avoid the spread of the infection outside the protection zone it is appropriate to preventively empty the poultry holdings situated in two areas particularly at risk.
(15) The other Member States have already adjusted the measures they apply to trade, and they are sufficiently informed by the Commission, and in particular in the context of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on the appropriate period for their implementation.
(16) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'title': '2003/214/EC: Commission Decision of 27 March 2003 concerning protective measures in relation to avian influenza in the Netherlands (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 1102)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

The hatching eggs must originate from a holding which at the day of collection of the eggs and on the day of the hatch is situated outside the established surveillance zones and at least 25 km away from any suspected or infected hatchery or holding.

Whereas Decision 80/47/EEC requires Member States to have prior authorization from the Commission before introducing intra-Community surveillance of the imports concerned;

COUNCIL DECISION
of 21 June 2013
abrogating Decision 2004/918/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Hungary
(2013/315/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 126(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) On 5 July 2004, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided, in Decision 2004/918/EC (1), that an excessive deficit existed in Hungary and adopted a Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2008.
(2) On 18 January 2005, in accordance with Article 104(8) TEC, the Council considered that Hungary had not taken effective action in response to its Recommendation and adopted another Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC on 8 March 2005, confirming the 2008 deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit. On 8 November 2005, the Council decided that Hungary had for the second time failed to comply with its Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC. Accordingly, it addressed a third Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC to Hungary on 10 October 2006, postponing the deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit to 2009. On 7 July 2009 the Council concluded that the Hungarian authorities could be considered to have taken effective action in response to the Council Recommendation of 10 October 2006 and, against the background of the severe economic downturn, issued a revised Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC (""the Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009""), setting once more a new deadline for correction, namely, 2011. On 27 January 2010 the Commission concluded that Hungary had taken effective action in response to the Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009, with which the Council concurred in its conclusions on 16 February 2010, but alerted about considerable risks.
(3) According to the provisions of Article 126(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Council decided on 24 January 2012 that Hungary had not taken effective action in response to the Council Recommendation of 7 July 2009 within the period laid down in that Recommendation. While the 3 % GDP Treaty reference value was not breached in 2011, this was not based on a structural and sustainable correction and hinged upon substantial one-off revenues. This was accompanied by an estimated cumulative structural deterioration of over 2 % of GDP in both 2010 and 2011 compared to a recommended cumulative fiscal improvement of 0,5 % of GDP. Moreover, while the authorities were implementing structural measures in 2012, which were expected to largely offset the previous deterioration, the 3 % GDP Treaty reference value would again be respected in 2012 only thanks to one-off measures of close to 1 % of GDP and would be breached in 2013.
(4) On 13 March 2012, the Council adopted a new Recommendation in accordance with Article 126(7) TFEU (""the Council Recommendation of 13 March 2012"") for Hungary to bring the excessive deficit to an end by 2012. The Hungarian authorities were asked to undertake the following steps in particular: (i) to put an end to the excessive deficit situation by 2012 in a credible and sustainable manner; (ii) to undertake an additional fiscal effort of at least ½ % of GDP to ensure the attainment of the 2012 deficit target of 2,5 % of GDP; and (iii) to take the necessary additional measures of a structural nature to ensure that the deficit in 2013 remains well below the 3 % of GDP threshold. At the same time, the government debt ratio was recommended to be brought back on a declining path as soon as possible so that it represents sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt reduction benchmark. The budgetary adjustment also needed to be supported by the proposed improvements in the fiscal governance framework. The Council established the deadline of 13 September 2012 for the Hungarian government to take effective action. Also on 13 March 2012, the Council decided (2) to suspend a part of the Cohesion Fund commitment appropriations for the year 2013 for Hungary.
(5) On 30 May 2012, based on the Convergence Programme for 2011 to 2015 and further specification of the savings measures, the Commission concluded that Hungary had taken effective action regarding the correction of the excessive deficit. In particular, the general government deficit was expected to reach 2,5 % of GDP in 2012 and remained well below the 3 % GDP Treaty reference value in 2013 as recommended in the Council Recommendation of 13 March 2012. Moreover, it was acknowledged that some progress had been made on enhancing the fiscal governance framework even though in this area overall progress could have been considered slow. Against this background, on 22 June 2012, the Council, following a proposal from the Commission of 30 May 2012, adopted Implementing Decision 2012/323/EU (3) lifting the suspension of the Cohesion Fund commitment appropriations.
(6) In accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaties, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States have to notify data on government deficits and debt, and other associated variables, twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4).
(7) When considering whether a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit ought to be abrogated, the Council has to take a decision on the basis of notified data. Moreover, a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit should be abrogated only if the Commission forecasts indicate that the deficit will not exceed the 3 % GDP Treaty reference value over the forecast horizon.
(8) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat), in accordance with Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 479/2009, following the notification by Hungary before 1 April 2013, the Commission services 2013 spring forecast and the assessment of additional corrective measures adopted on 13 May 2013 in a Government decree, the following conclusions are justified:
— In 2012, on the basis of a considerable fiscal effort, the general government deficit reached 1,9 % of GDP. This was also due to one-off revenues amounting to ¾ % of GDP, including the higher than budgeted one-off revenues of 0,2 % of GDP related to further transfer of assets from the private to the public pension pillar. The adopted 2012 budget targeted a deficit of 2,5 % of GDP on the basis of a 0,5 % growth. The budget contained an extraordinary reserve of 1,1 % of GDP and numerous consolidation measures, in particular: (i) revenue-increasing measures of around 1¾ % of GDP, including hikes in indirect taxes and social security contributions; (ii) structural measures on the expenditure side of ¾ % of GDP, such as a review of social benefits; and (iii) expenditure constraints of ¼ % of GDP in the public sector, including a nominal wage freeze in most sectors. In order to counterbalance the constantly deteriorating growth outlook, the Government adopted two main additional corrective packages in April and October 2012 (totalling 0,7 % of GDP), comprising mainly further cuts in the appropriations of the budgetary institutions, of which around half was implemented. In addition, the balance of the local government sector improved by around 0,7 % of GDP compared to the budgeted plans, mainly due to their low investment activity.
— The Convergence Programme for 2012 to 2016 projects the general government deficit to stay at 2,7 % of GDP in both 2013 and 2014. However, the Commission services 2013 spring forecast foresees a deficit of 3,0 % of GDP in 2013 and 3,3 % of GDP in 2014, which suggests that the excessive deficit has not been brought to an end in a durable way. On 13 May 2013, following the release of the Commission services 2013 spring forecast, the Government adopted further corrective measures amounting in gross terms to about 0,3 % and 0,7 % of GDP for 2013 and 2014, respectively. The Commission services updated fiscal assessment, which takes into account the net deficit improving effect of these additional corrective measures, projects a deficit of 2,7 % of GDP and 2,9 % of GDP in 2013 and 2014, respectively. Thus, the deficit is expected to remain below the 3 % GDP Treaty reference value over the Commission services 2013 spring forecast horizon. In addition, according to the Commission services estimation, the cyclically-adjusted budget balance, net of one-off and other temporary measures, will stand at – ¾ % and – 1½ % of GDP in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and hence will be consistent with the Hungarian medium-term budgetary objective of – 1,7 % of GDP.
— The debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced from a peak of close to 82 % in 2010 to 79,2 % in 2012, thanks to substantial one-off capital transfers linked to the abolition of the mandatory private pension pillar and a number of consolidation measures. According to the Convergence Programme, the debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to decline, falling to 78,1 % and 77,2 % in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and remaining on a downward path thereafter. Even after incorporating the impact of the new corrective measurres adopted on 13 May 2013, the Commission forecasts a higher trajectory for the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 1 percentage point for both 2013 and 2014.
(9) As to fiscal governance, the Council asked the Hungarian authorities to establish a truly binding medium-term framework and broaden the analytical remit of the Fiscal Council in view of its veto right over the annual budget. The Convergence Programme for 2012 to 2016 announces the intention to move forward in this area in autumn 2013. Progress will continue to be closely monitored in the context of the European Semester.
(10) Starting from 2013, which is the year following the correction of the excessive deficit, Hungary should maintain a fiscal stance in line with its medium-term budgetary objective, including respecting the expenditure benchmark, and make sufficient progress towards compliance with the debt criterion in accordance with Article 2(1a) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (5).
(11) In accordance with Article 126(12) TFEU, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(12) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in Hungary has been corrected and Decision 2004/918/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '26.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 173/43', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 21 June 2013\nabrogating Decision 2004/918/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Hungary\n(2013/315/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) On 5 July 2004, in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC), the Council decided, in Decision 2004/918/EC(1), that an excessive deficit existed in Hungary and adopted a Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2008.\n\n((2)) On 18 January 2005, in accordance with Article 104(8) TEC, the Council considered that Hungary had not taken effective action in response to its Recommendation and adopted another Recommendation under Article 104(7) TEC on 8 March 2005, confirming the 2008 deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit.

","COUNCIL DECISION of 27 July 1994 authorizing the Kingdom of Spain to apply a measure derogating from Articles 2 (1) and 17 of the sixth Directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes  (94/501/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax (VAT): uniform basis of assessment (1), and in particular Article  27 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 27 (1) of Directive 77/388/EEC, the Council, acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission, may authorize any Member State to introduce special measures for derogation from that Directive, in order to simplify the  procedure for charging the tax or to prevent certain types of tax evasion or avoidance;
Whereas, by letter dated 3 March 1994 and received by the Commission on 11 April 1994, the Kingdom of Spain requested authorization to introduce a measure for derogation from Article 17 of Directive 77/388/EEC;
Whereas the other Member States were informed on 26 April 1994 of the request made by the Kingdom of Spain;
Whereas implementation of the transitional VAT arrangements leads to VAT being charged on certain works on movable tangible property and certain services relating to the transport of goods and ancillary transport activities at the place where these  services are supplied, irrespective of the place where the taxable person to whom these services are supplied is able to exercise his rights of deduction; whereas this results in growing use of the refund procedures provided for by Directives  79/1072/EEC (2) and 86/560/EEC (3);
Whereas the increasing use of the refund procedures provided for by Directives 79/1072/EEC and 86/560/EEC may impede the development of intra-Community trade in certain services;
Whereas the measure for derogation in question aims to introduce a simplification consisting in the exemption of certain services supplied to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country but identified in the Community, for which  these taxable persons would in any event be entitled to a refund;

amending Regulation (EC) No 975/98 on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 128(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Central Bank (2),
Whereas:
(1) Commission Recommendation 2009/23/EC of 19 December 2008 on common guidelines for the national sides and the issuance of euro coins intended for circulation (3), endorsed by the Council conclusions of 10 February 2009, defines common principles for the designs used for the national sides of euro circulation coins and establishes procedures whereby Member States inform each other of draft designs, and for the approval of these designs.
(2) As the euro coins circulate in the whole euro area, their national design features are a matter of common interest. To permit their smooth circulation and in the interests of legal certainty and transparency it is appropriate that the rules defined in Recommendation 2009/23/EC concerning denominations and technical specifications of euro circulation coins, be made legally binding by integrating them into Council Regulation (EC) No 975/98 (4).
(3) Euro coins have a common European side and a distinctive national side. The common European sides of euro coins bear both the name of the single currency and the denomination of the coin. The national side should neither repeat the name of the single currency nor the denomination of the coin.
(4) A clear indication of the name of the issuing Member State should be put on the national side of the coin in order to allow interested coin users to easily identify the issuing Member State.
(5) The edge lettering of euro coins should be considered part of the national side and should therefore not repeat any indication of the denomination, except for the 2-euro coin, and provided that only the figure ‘2’ or the term ‘euro’ in the relevant alphabet, or both, are used.
(6) The designs on the national side of euro coins are decided upon by each Member State whose currency is the euro and should take into account the fact that euro coins circulate in the whole euro area and not only in the issuing Member State. In order to ensure that coins are immediately recognisable as euro coins also from their national side, the design should be fully surrounded by the 12 stars of the Union flag.
(7) In order to facilitate the recognition of circulation coins and to ensure appropriate continuity in the minting, Member States should only be allowed to modify the designs used for the national sides of regular circulation coins once every 15 years, except if the Head of State referred to on a coin changes. This should, however, be without prejudice to changes necessary to prevent counterfeiting of the currency. Changes to the design of the common European side of circulation coins should be decided by the Council and voting rights should be restricted to Member States whose currency is the euro.
(8) Individual Member States should be allowed to issue commemorative coins to celebrate subjects of major national or European relevance, whereas commemorative coins issued collectively by all Member States whose currency is the euro should be reserved for subjects of the highest European relevance. The 2-euro coin constitutes the most suitable denomination for this purpose, principally on account of the large diameter of the coin and its technical characteristics, which offer adequate protection against counterfeiting.
(9) Taking into account that euro coins circulate in the whole euro area, to avoid the use of inappropriate designs, issuing Member States should inform each other and the Commission about draft designs for the national side of euro coins in advance of the planned issue date. The Commission should verify the compliance of the designs with the technical requirements of this Regulation. Submission of draft designs to the Commission should be made sufficiently in advance of the planned issue date for issuing Member States to modify the design if necessary.
(10) Furthermore, uniform conditions for the approval of the designs of the national sides of euro coins should be laid down to avoid the choice of designs which could be considered as inappropriate in some Member States. In view of the fact that the competence for an issue as sensitive as the design of the national sides of the euro coins belongs to the issuing Member States, implementing powers should therefore be conferred on the Council. Any implementing decisions taken on this basis by the Council would be closely connected to the acts adopted by the Council on the basis of Article 128(2) of the Treaty; therefore, the suspension of the voting rights of the members of the Council representing Member States whose currency is not the euro for the adoption by the Council of those decisions should apply as set out in Article 139(4) of the Treaty. The procedure should allow the issuing Member States to modify the design in due time if so required.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 16(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007 of 4 December 2007 on the second phase of the 10-year work programme referred to in Article 16(2) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market (2) establishes a list of active substances to be assessed, with a view to their possible inclusion in Annex I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC. That list includes flufenoxuron.
(2) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, flufenoxuron (CAS No 101463-69-8; EC No 417-680-3) has been evaluated in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC for use in product type 18, insecticides, acaricides and products to control other arthropods, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(3) France was designated as rapporteur Member State and submitted the competent authority report, together with a recommendation, to the Commission on 17 March 2009 in accordance with Article 14(4) and (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007.
(4) The competent authority report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission. In accordance with Article 15(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1451/2007, the findings of the review were incorporated, within the Standing Committee on Biocidal Products on 22 September 2011, in an assessment report.
(5) The assessment of risks to the environmental compartments of concern, carried out using a realistic approach, has demonstrated unacceptable effects for the aquatic compartment. Furthermore, the characteristics of flufenoxuron render it persistent, liable to bioaccumulate and toxic, as well as very persistent and very liable to bioaccumulate, in accordance with the criteria laid down in Annex XIII to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (3). It is therefore not appropriate to include flufenoxuron for use in product type 18 in Annexes I, IA or IB to Directive 98/8/EC.
(6) The date as of which date biocidal products of product type 18 containing flufenoxuron should no longer be placed on the market should be reasonable with regard to the outcome of the risk assessment as well as the date of entry into force of this Decision..

amending Commission Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the People's Republic of China and terminating the interim review of the anti-dumping measures imposed thereby
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1), (‘basic Regulation’) and in particular Articles 9 and 11(3) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A.   PROCEDURE
1.   Previous procedure
(1) By Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC (2), the Commission imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm, falling within CN code ex 2704 00 19 (TARIC code 2704001910), originating in the People's Republic of China (‘country concerned’ or ‘PRC’). The amount of the anti-dumping duty is equal to the fixed amount of EUR 32,6 per tonne of dry net weight.
(2) In view of the expiry of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community on 23 July 2002, the Council, by Regulation (EC) No 963/2002 (3), decided that anti-dumping measures which had been adopted pursuant to Decision No 2277/96/ECSC and which were still in force on 23 July 2002 were to be continued and governed by the provisions of the basic Regulation with effect from 24 July 2002.
2.   Current procedure
(3) On 11 December 2002, the Commission announced, by notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities
 (4), the initiation of an interim review of the definitive anti-dumping measures applicable to imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm (hereafter ‘coke 80+’ or ‘the product concerned’) originating in the PRC in accordance with Article 11(3) of the basic Regulation and commenced an investigation.
(4) The proceeding was initiated following a request lodged by Eucoke-EEIG (the ‘applicant’) on behalf of producers representing a major proportion of the total Community production of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm. The applicant alleged that dumping in respect of the PRC had continued and even increased and that the existing measures would no longer be sufficient to counteract the injurious effects of dumping. The evidence contained in the request for a review was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of the investigation.
(5) The Commission officially advised the producers/exporters, the importers and the users known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting country concerned, the applicant Community industry and the other known Community producers about the initiation of the interim review. Interested parties were given the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing within the time limit set out in the notice of initiation.
3.   Suspension of measures
(6) It is recalled that during the investigation of the present proceeding a number of interested parties provided information on a change in market conditions after the end of the investigation period (1 October 2001 to 30 September 2002), thus fulfilling the conditions required under Article 14(4) of the basic Regulation to justify the suspension of the measures currently in force.
(7) The investigation showed that all requirements for suspending the anti-dumping measures were met. Therefore, by Commission Decision No 264/2004EC (5), the anti-dumping duty applicable to imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80 mm originating in the PRC was suspended for a period of nine months.
4.   Withdrawal of the application
(8) By letter of 15 December 2003 to the Commission, Eucoke-EEIG formally withdrew its application.
(9) With regard to the fact that the investigation has not brought to light any consideration showing that such termination would not be in the Community interest, it is considered that the present proceeding should be terminated in accordance with Article 9(1) of the basic Regulation.
5.   Form of the measures
(10) However, during the investigation, it was found that there was a need to clarify the scope of application of the existing measures in view of the difficulties faced by an economic operator with respect to the application of the measures in force. Indeed, it was found that anti-dumping duties were being collected by the customs authorities of one Member State on shipments of coke destined for use in blast furnaces, which are not concerned by the anti-dumping measures, and comprise only a small part of the product concerned. In order to ensure a more efficient and uniform enforcement of the measures, the exemption provided for in Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC for exports which are a mixture of coke of coal in pieces of smaller size than the product concerned and coke of coal in pieces not exceeding 100 mm is replaced by an exemption covering a mixture in which the proportion of coke exceeding 80 mm does not constitute more than 20 % of the mixed shipment. In addition, the ISO standard should be used as the method of measurement.
6.   Conclusion
(11) The interim review should be terminated. The scope of application of the existing measures should be clarified,","{'header': '20.5.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 183/1', 'title': ""COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 997/2004\nof 17 May 2004\namending Commission Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces with a diameter of more than 80\xa0mm originating in the People's Republic of China and terminating the interim review of the anti-dumping measures imposed thereby"", 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\nThe interim review of the anti-dumping measures imposed by Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC on imports of coke of coal in pieces larger than 80\xa0mm in maximum diameter, falling within CN code ex\xa02704\xa000\xa019 (TARIC code 2704001910) and originating in the People's Republic of China is hereby terminated.""}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\nArticle 1 of Decision No 2730/2000/ECSC shall be replaced by the following:\n‘Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of coke of coal in pieces of a diameter of more than 80\xa0mm, falling within CN code ex\xa02704\xa000\xa019 (Taric code 2704001910) and originating in the People's Republic of China.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 206/68 2 of 20 February 1968 laying down outline provisions for contracts and inter-trade agreements on the purchase of beet defines the contracting parties as beet sellers on the one hand and sugar manufacturers on the other ; whereas a seller may sell either beet he has grown himself or beet he has bought from a grower ; whereas, however, in view of the importance of contracts within the quota system, only a contract concluded between a manufacturer and a grower may be regarded as a delivery contract for the purpose of Article 30 (2) of Regulation No 1009/67/EEC;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas there are differences between the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the limitation of the maximum tar yield of cigarettes; whereas such differences are liable to constitute barriers to trade and to impede the establishment and operation of the internal market;
Whereas those obstacles should accordingly be eliminated and whereas to that end the marketing and free movement of cigarettes must be made subject to common rules concerning maximum tar yields;
Whereas such common rules must take due account of public health protection;
Whereas the higher the tar content of smoked tobacco, the greater the risk of lung cancer and whereas the European Council held in Milan on 28 and 29 June 1985 stressed the importance of launching a European action programme against cancer;
Whereas, in their resolution of 7 July 1986 (4), the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council considered that measures to combat smoking were a priority;
Whereas in applying this Directive provision should be made for establishing deadlines which allow, on the one hand, completion to a minimum degree of efficiency of the process of conversion to other varieties which has already begun, and, on the other, consumers and manufacturers to adapt to products with a lower tar yield;
Whereas this Directive contains provisions, which will be reviewed on the basis of experience gained, the development of techniques and medical knowledge in this area, the objective being to achieve greater protection of individuals;
Whereas smokers must always be aware that all cigarettes are harmful to health; whereas it is much more desirable for them to stop smoking rather than to switch to low-tar cigarettes;
Whereas the initiative set out in this Directive will have an even more beneficial effect on public health if it is coupled with health education programmes during the years of compulsory education and with information and public awareness campaigns;
Whereas the introduction of maximum tar yields would result in particular socioeconomic difficulties for the Hellenic Republic; whereas that Member State should be granted, exceptionally, a derogation with regard to the implementation dates laid down for the other Member States,","{'title': 'Council Directive 90/239/EEC of 17 May 1990 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the maximum tar yield of cigarettes', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe objective of this Directive is the harmonization of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the maximum tar yield of cigarettes, taking as a basis a high level of public health protection by the reduction of the health damage caused by tar.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EU) No 494/2011 of 20 May 2011 amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) as regards Annex XVII (Cadmium) (2) modified the scope of the restriction on cadmium and cadmium compounds, introducing provisions applicable to brazing sticks and jewellery in accordance with the risk evaluation and the risk reduction strategies for cadmium and cadmium oxide (3).
(2) Regulation (EU) No 494/2011 furthermore extended the existing restriction on the use of cadmium and cadmium compounds in synthetic organic polymers (plastic material) to all plastic materials, while providing an exception for the use of recovered PVC containing cadmium in the manufacture of certain construction products. This derogation was granted taking into account the discussions in an ad hoc expert meeting on risk management activities under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and the results of the study on Socio-Economic Impact of a Potential Update of the Restrictions on the Marketing and Use of Cadmium in jewelleries, brazing alloys and PVC, published in January 2010 (4). All elements of the restriction were also subject to consultation with the Member States’ competent authorities responsible for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 and with stakeholders.
(3) Following the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, the Commission was informed of uses of cadmium pigments in certain types of plastics materials, restricted for the first time by Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, where suitable alternatives to the use of cadmium compounds appear not to be available and for which, due to the exceptional circumstances of a limited consultation, further assessment is now appropriate.
(4) The Council Resolution of 25 January 1988 calls for an overall strategy to combat environmental pollution by cadmium, including specific measures to restrict the use of cadmium and stimulate the development of further alternatives to the use of cadmium in pigments, stabilisers and plating, asking for limitation of the uses of cadmium to cases where suitable alternatives do not exist.
(5) The Commission will ask the European Chemicals Agency, in accordance with Article 69 of REACH, to prepare a dossier conforming to the requirements of Annex XV relating to the use of cadmium and cadmium compounds in those types of plastic material that were restricted for the first time by Regulation (EU) No 494/2011, taking full account of the Council Resolution of 25 January 1988.
(6) Until the restriction procedure is finalised, the restriction on the use of cadmium and its compounds should be limited to the types of plastic material listed in entry 23 of Annex XVII before the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 494/2011.
(7) For reasons of legal certainty, this Regulation should apply from 10 December 2011.

(4) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by traditional importers for the products listed in Annex I to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex I to the imports, expressed in volume terms, of each importer over the reference period.
(5) Examination of the figures supplied by Member States shows that the aggregate volume of applications submitted by non-traditional importers for the products listed in Annex II to this Regulation exceeds the portion of the quota set aside for them. The applications must therefore be met by applying the uniform rate of reduction shown in Annex II to the amounts requested by each importer, as limited by Regulation (EC) No 538/2003.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, under the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the United States of America for the conclusion of negotiations under GATT Article XXIV. 6, as approved by the Council Decision of 30 January 1987, the Community undertook for the period 1987 to 1990, to open an annual Community tariff quota of 12 000 tonnes at a duty rate of 10 % for dried, dehydrated or evaporated onions, falling within subheading 07.04 A of the Common Customs Tariff; whereas, therefore, this tariff quota should be opened for 1987;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quota and the application, without interruption, of the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, in order to safeguard the Community character of this quota, it seems advisable not to allocate the latter among the Member States but to allow them to draw against the quota volume such quantities as they may need under the conditions and according to a procedure to be specified; whereas this method of management requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is used up and inform the Member States thereof;

Payment shall be made into the account referred to in Article 2 of the Protocol.\n\nFees shall include all national and local charges except those for the performance of services. Once signed, the licences shall be issued by the Equatorial Guinea authorities to the shipowners or their representatives via the authorities of the  Commission of the European Communities in Equatorial Guinea within 15 working days of the date on which the proof of payment is received.\n\nLicences shall be issued for a specific vessel and shall not be transferable. However, at the request of the European Economic Community, and where force majeur is proven, a vessel's licence shall be replaced by a new licence for another vessel whose  features are similar to those of the first vessel. The owner of the first vessel shall return the cancelled licence to the Ministry of Water, Forestry and Reafforestation of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea via the authorities of the Commission of the  European Communities.\n\nThe new licence shall indicate:\n\n- the date of issue,\n\n- the fact that the licence cancels and replaces that granted to the previous vessel.\n\nThe licence must be held on board at all times.\n\n1.  Provisions applicable to trawlers\n\n(a)  The licences for trawlers shall be issued for a year, six months or three months. They shall be renewable.\n\n(b)  The fees for annual licences shall be as follows:\n\nECU 90 per grt per year for fin fish trawlers,\n\nECU 100 per grt per year for shrimp trawlers.\n\n(c)  The fees for half-year licences shall be as follows:\n\nECU 55 per grt per half-yearly period for fin fish trawlers,\n\nECU 60 per grt per half-yearly period for shrimp trawlers.\n\n(d)  The fees for quarterly licences shall be set as follows:\n\nECU 30 per grt per quarterly period for fin fish trawlers,\n\nECU 35 per grt per quarterly period for shrimp trawlers.\n\n2.

The statement shall be forwarded simultaneously to the Equatorial Guinea authorities and to the shipowners. Any additional payment due shall be made by  the shipowners to the Ministry of Water, Forestry and Reafforestation of Equatorial Guinea by 30 May of the following year at the latest, in accordance with the procedure for payment set out in Article 2 of the Protocol.\n\nHowever, if the amount of the final statement is lower than the abovementioned amount, the resulting balance shall not be reimbursable.\n\nB.

The wages of these fishermen, to be borne by the shipowners, shall be fixed by mutual agreement between the shipowners and the Equatorial Guinea authorities. Should the fishermen not be signed on, the shipowners shall be obliged to pay a lump sum  equivalent to 30 % of the seamen's wages. This sum will be used for the training of fishermen in Equatorial Guinea and is to be paid into an account specified by the Equatorial Guinea authorities.\n\nE.  Taking on board of observers\n\nEach trawler may be obliged to take on board an observer designated by the Ministry of Water, Forestry and Reafforestation. In that case, the observer shall be included in the number of fishermen to be signed on established in point D.\n\nThe observer shall be offered every facility needed to carry out his duties. The presence and work of this observer must not interrupt or prejudice fishing operations. The salary and the social contributions of the observer shall be borne by the  Government of Equatorial Guinea.\n\nF.  Inspection and monitoring\n\nAny Community vessel fishing in Equatorial Guinea's fishing zone shall allow on board any official of Equatorial Guinea responsible for inspection and monitoring and shall assist him in the accomplishment of his duties. The official must not remain on  board any longer than is necessary for the verification of catches by random checks and for any other inspection relating to fishing activities.\n\nG.  Fishing zones\n\nThe vessels referred to in Article 1 of the Protocol shall be authorized to fish in waters beyond four nautical miles from the base lines.\n\nH.  Meshes authorized\n\nThe minimum mesh size authorized for the trawl body (mesh fully extended) shall be:\n\n(a)  60 mm for fin fish vessels catching less than 30 % shrimps;\n\n(b)  25 mm for shrimp vessels catching more than 30 % shrimps.\n\nOutrigger fishing shall be authorized.\n\nI.\n\nEntering and leaving the zone\n\nAll Community vessels fishing under the Agreement in the Equatorial Guinea zone shall communicate to the radio station indicated on the licence the date and time and their position when entering and leaving the Equatorial Guinea fishing zone.\n\nJ.  Procedure in case of boarding\n\n1.  The authorities of the Commission of the European Communities in Equatorial Guinea shall be notified within two working days of any boarding within the Equatorial Guinea exclusive economic zone of a fishing vessel flying the flag of a Member State  of the Community and holding a valid licence granted under the Agreement. The authorities shall at the same time receive a brief report of the circumstances and reasons leading to the boarding.\n\n2.  Before any measures regarding the master or the crew of the vessel or any action regarding the cargo and equipment of the vessel are considered, other than those to safeguard evidence relating to the presumed infringement, a consultation meeting  shall be held, within one working day from the receipt of the abovementioned information, between the authorities of the Commission of the European Communities in Equatorial Guinea, the Fisheries Department and the inspection authorities, possibly  attended by a representative of the Member State concerned. At the meeting, the parties shall exchange any relevant documentation or information helping to clarify the circumstances of the established facts. The shipowner or his representative shall be  informed of the outcome of the meeting and of any measures resulting from the boarding.\n\n3.  Before any judicial procedure, an attempt shall be made to resolve the presumed infringement through a compromise procedure. This procedure shall end no later than three working days after the boarding.\n\n4.  Should the case not be settled by means of compromise, and therefore be brought before a competent Equatorial Guinea judicial body, a reasonable bank security shall be fixed by the competent authority within two working days, following the  conclusion of the compromise procedure, pending the judicial decision. The bank security shall be released by the competent authority once the master of the vessel concerned has been acquitted by the judicial decision.\n\n5.  The vessel and its crew shall be released either:\n\n- at the end of the consultation meeting, if the established facts permit,\n\nor\n\n- on receipt of payment of a fine (compromise procedure),\n\nor\n\n- once a bank security is deposited (judicial procedure).\n\n6.  Should one of the parties consider that there is a problem in the application of the abovementioned procedure, it may request urgent consultations under Article 8 of the Agreement.\n\nAnnex 1\n\nREPUBLIC OF EQUATORIAL GUINEA  APPLICATION FOR A FISHING LICENCE\n\n1.

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 lays down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in animals. It applies to the production and placing on the market of live animals and products of animal origin and in certain specific cases to exports thereof.
(2) Point 4 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 sets out a list of rapid tests approved for the monitoring of TSEs in bovine, ovine and caprine animals.
(3) On 30 August 2007, a laboratory informed the Commission that it will cease marketing the approved rapid test for the monitoring of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). It is therefore appropriate to delete that test (Institut Pourquier Speed’it BSE) from the list of rapid tests for the monitoring of BSE in bovine animals in Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Articles 152 and 153 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 19 of Commission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 September 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing Decision 2004/210/EC (1) states that members of the Scientific Committees, scientific advisors from the Pool and external experts shall be entitled to an indemnity for their participation in the meetings of the Committees, thematic workshops, working groups and other meetings and events organised by the Commission, and for serving as Rapporteur on a specific question.
(2) Annex III to Decision 2008/721/EC fixes at EUR 300 the indemnity for each full day of participation, at EUR 150 the indemnity for participating in a morning or afternoon meeting, and at EUR 300 the indemnity for acting as Rapporteur. The latter may be increased at EUR 600 where fully justified and subject to availability of budget for questions which are particularly demanding in terms of workload.
(3) That Annex also states that the Commission will regularly assess the need to adapt these indemnities in light of prices indexes, the evaluation of indemnities paid to experts in other European bodies and the experience on the workload for members, associated members, other scientific advisors and external experts. The first assessment should take place in 2009.
(4) The current level of indemnities was fixed in 1997 for the members and experts of the predecessors of the Scientific Committees in question and has not been re-evaluated since then. The daily indemnity adapted taking into account the consumer prices increase in the period 1997-2008 based on the Consumer Price Index Data of Eurostat would be of EUR 381,50 This amount should be rounded up to EUR 385.
(5) The distinction between full day and half day meetings should be eliminated in order to take into account travelling and transport time.
(6) In light of experience, the workload for Rapporteurs depends substantially on the complexity and duration of the activities needed to complete the opinion, taking into account the complexity of the issue, the availability and accessibility of data, the amount of literature to be examined, the need for collaboration with other bodies and the extent and complexity of stakeholder and public consultations required. The current two levels for the Rapporteur indemnity do not reflect the actual range of situations and therefore a wider modulation of the Rapporteur indemnity should be introduced,","{'header': '28.7.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 196/61', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 27 July 2009\namending Decision 2008/721/EC as regards indemnities paid to members of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment\n(notified under document number C(2009) 5767)\n(2009/566/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 19 of Commission Decision 2008/721/EC of 5 September 2008 setting up an advisory structure of Scientific Committees and experts in the field of consumer safety, public health and the environment and repealing Decision 2004/210/EC(1)states that members of the Scientific Committees, scientific advisors from the Pool and external experts shall be entitled to an indemnity for their participation in the meetings of the Committees, thematic workshops, working groups and other meetings and events organised by the Commission, and for serving as Rapporteur on a specific question.\n\n((2)) Annex III to Decision 2008/721/EC fixes at EUR\xa0300 the indemnity for each full day of participation, at EUR\xa0150 the indemnity for participating in a morning or afternoon meeting, and at EUR\xa0300 the indemnity for acting as Rapporteur.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (1), and in particular the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 7 (5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under Article 6(2) and pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Spanish application to register the name Miel de Galicia or Mel de Galicia was published in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (2).
(2) Germany and Italy submitted an objection to the registration under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006. In their objections, Germany and Italy stated that the conditions laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 had not been fulfilled and that in particular the link between the product and the geographical area was not demonstrated to the requisite legal standard and was thus insufficient to satisfy the definition of a geographical indication. In addition, Germany pointed out that certain elements contained in the product specification were likely to be in breach of Council Directive 2001/110/EC on honey of 20 December 2001 (3), in particular the option of adding dried fruit to the honey, which according to Germany was not in compliance with the definition of ‘honey’ given in the Directive.
(3) In a letter of 16 November 2005 the Commission asked the Member States concerned to seek agreement amongst themselves in accordance with their internal procedures.
(4) Given that no agreement was reached between Spain, Germany and Italy within the designated time frame, the Commission must adopt a decision in accordance with the procedure outlined in Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(5) Following consultation between Spain, Germany and Italy, details have been added to the product specification of the designations in question. With respect to the product description, honey containing dried fruit was removed from the product specification. Furthermore, the link between the product and the defined geographical area was emphasised, highlighting the reputation the product enjoys and detailing the natural characteristics of the geographical area, which make the product concerned unique and distinguish it from honeys produced in other geographical areas.
(6) In the Commission’s opinion, the amended version of the product specification is fully in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.
(7) In light of the above, the designation must be entered into the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,","{'header': '24.7.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 192/11', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 868/2007\nof 23 July 2007\nentering a designation in the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications (Miel de GaliciaorMel de Galicia(PGI))', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Under Article 6(2) and pursuant to Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006, the Spanish application to register the nameMiel de GaliciaorMel de Galiciawas published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union(2).\n\n((2)) Germany and Italy submitted an objection to the registration under Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.

Furthermore, the link between the product and the defined geographical area was emphasised, highlighting the reputation the product enjoys and detailing the natural characteristics of the geographical area, which make the product concerned unique and distinguish it from honeys produced in other geographical areas.\n\n((6)) In the Commission’s opinion, the amended version of the product specification is fully in compliance with Regulation (EC) No 510/2006.\n\n((7)) In light of the above, the designation must be entered into the Register of protected designations of origin and protected geographical indications.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Protected Geographical Indications and Protected Designations of Origin,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe designation contained in Annex I to this Regulation shall be entered in the register.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nA summary of the main points of the specification is given in Annex II to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the 20th day following its publication in the\nOfficial Journal of the European Union\n.'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Protocol 4 on cotton, annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1050/2001(1),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 of 22 May 2001 on production aid for cotton(2), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, a world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined periodically from the price for ginned cotton recorded on the world market and by reference to the historical relationship between the price recorded for ginned cotton and that calculated for unginned cotton. That historical relationship has been established in Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001 of 2 August 2001(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1486/2002(4). Where the world market price cannot be determined in this way, it is to be based on the most recent price determined.
(2) In accordance with Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001, the world market price for unginned cotton is to be determined in respect of a product of specific characteristics and by reference to the most favourable offers and quotations on the world market among those considered representative of the real market trend. To that end, an average is to be calculated of offers and quotations recorded on one or more European exchanges for a product delivered cif to a port in the Community and coming from the various supplier countries considered the most representative in terms of international trade. However, there is provision for adjusting the criteria for determining the world market price for ginned cotton to reflect differences justified by the quality of the product delivered and the offers and quotations concerned. Those adjustments are specified in Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1591/2001.
(3) The application of the above criteria gives the world market price for unginned cotton determined hereinafter,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1544/2003 of 29 August 2003 determining the world market price for unginned cotton', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe world price for unginned cotton as referred to in Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No 1051/2001 is hereby determined as equalling EUR 28,402/100 kg.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 30 August 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 29 August 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nJ.

","COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 1305/87
of 11 May 1987
imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of outboard motors originating in Japan
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, submitted after consultations within the Advisory Committee as provided for by the above Regulation,
Whereas,
A. Procedure
(1) On 26 November 1985, the Commission reopened the anti-dumping investigation concerning outboard motors originating in Japan following a request for review lodged by Community producers representing a major proportion of the Community production of outboard motors (2). The request for review contained evidence of renewed dumping and renewed injury caused thereby which was considered sufficient to warrant the reopening of the investigation. The products referred to in the request for review are outboard motors up to and including 63 kW (85 hp) falling within subheading ex 84.06 B of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE codes 84.06-10 and ex 84.06-12.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainant and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
All but one of the Community producers, the exporter concerned and some importers, as well as two associations representing boat builders and users, made their views known in writing. In addition, one Community producer and all the exporters concerned requested, and were granted, a hearing.
(3) The Commission sought and verified all information it considered necessary and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
EEC producers:
- Outboard Marine Belgium SA, Bruges, Belgium
- Outboard Marine Deutschland GmbH, Mannheim, Germany
- Outboard Marine France, Paris, France
- Outboard Marine UK, Northampton, United Kingdom
- Selva SpA, Tirano, Italy
Exporters:
- Honda Motor Co, Tokyo, Japan
- Suzuki Motor Co, Hamamatsu, Japan
- Tohatsu Corporation, Tokyo, Japan
- Yamaha Motor Co, Hamamatsu, Japan
Importers:
- Honda Deutschland GmbH, Offenbach, Germany
- Marine Power Europe Inc., Verviers, Belgium
- Suzuki Deutschland GmbH, Heppenheim, Germany
- Yamaha Motor Europe NV, Uithoorn, Netherlands
- Yamaha Motor France, Paris, France
- Yamaha Motor Netherlands, Uithoorn, Netherlands
- Mitsui Machinery Sales (UK) Ltd, Chessington, United Kingdom
The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January to 31 October 1985.
B. Scope of the investigaiton
(4) The Commission found that, during the investigation period, by far the largest of the Community producers ceased producing outboard motors of above 18,5 kW (25 hp). The only other complainant Community producer produces relatively small quantities of outboard motors of more than 18,5 kW and in 1985 accounted for less than 5 % of total Community production of such motors. The Commission, consequently, did not find it appropriate to cover, in its investigation, outboard motors of up to 63 kW (85 hp) as was requested in the application for review.
(5) It was, however, considered reasonable for the present investigation to cover outboard motors of up to 26 kW (35 hp), since those motors closely resemble 18,5 kW outboard motors with regard to motor capacity, design, weight and technical features.
(6) This limitation of the scope of the investigation may be confirmed (cf. also recital 29).
C. Normal value
(7) For Honda Motor Co and Yamaha Motor Co the Commission established the normal value on the basis of domestic prices actually paid or payable in the ordinary course of trade for the like product, since these prices were shown to be profitable.
(8) For Suzuki Motor Co and Tohatsu Corporation the Commission determined the normal value on the basis of constructed value, since the sales of these two companies on the domestic market did not provide a sufficient basis for the calculation of normal value. The constructed value was determined by adding the cost of production, including a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses, and a reasonable margin of profit.
D. Export price
(9) Export prices were determined by the Commission on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable for the products sold for export to the Community.
(10) Where exports were made to subsidiary companies in the Community, the Commission constructed the export prices on the basis of the prices at which the imported product was first resold to an independent buyer, suitably adjusted to take account of all costs incurred between importation and resale, including customs duty, and of a profit margin of 5 % considered reasonable in the light of the profit margins of independent importers of the product concerned.
E. Comparison
(11) In comparing normal value with export prices, the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability, in particular discounts and rebates, credit terms, transport, insurance, handling, packing and salesmen's salaries. Due allowance for such differences was made where claims in these areas could be satisfactorily demonstrated. All comparisons were made at ex-works level and for each individual transaction.
F. Margins
(12) The above examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of all exporters involved, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
(13) These margins vary according to the exporter, the importing Member State and the type of outboard motor concerned, the weighted average margin for each of the exporters investigated being as follows:
- Honda Motor Co: 16,2 %,
- Suzuki Motor Co: 51,6 %,
- Tohatsu Corporation 43,3 %,
- Yamaha Motor Co: 53,2 %.
(14) The above findings with regard to dumping may be confirmed.
G. Injury
(15) In 1983, after having carried out an anti-dumping investigation, the Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 1500/83 (1), established that dumped imports of outboard motors originating in Japan had caused injury to the Community industry concerned and that protective measures were necessary. The Commission subsequently, by Decision 83/452/EEC (2), accepted undertakings by most of the exporters concerned with a view to eliminating the injury by voluntary price increases for the exported products. For all other exporters a definitive anti-dumping duty was imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2809/83 (3).
(16) The Commission found that, while these measures contributed to an improvement of the position of the Community producers of outboard motors in 1984, the situation of this industry deteriorated again in 1985. It is still characterized by low capacity utilization, considerable losses and high import penetration.
(17) With regard to the renewed injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows, more specifically, that imports of outboard motors into the Community from Japan fell from 67 204 units in 1983 to 46 654 units in 1984, but increased again to 56 577 units in 1985. This resurgence represents an increase of 21 % in one year.
(18) At the same time, consumption of outboard motors within the Community fell from 161 209 units in 1983 to 127 959 units in 1984, but increased again to 137 465 units in 1985, i.e. by 7,4 %. Consequently, the market share in the Community held by outboard motors imported from Japan, having fallen from 41,7 % in 1983 to 36,5 % in 1984, went up again to 41,2 % in 1985.
(19) The market share held by Community producers of outboard motors during that three year period went up from 50,3 % to 53,4 % but decreased again to 53,2 %.
(20) With regard to the prices at which the dumped imports from Japan were sold within the Community during the investigation period, clear cases of price undercutting were found in some instances only. It was found that, in view of the fact that imports from Japan were regaining market share, the Community industry was unable to raise its prices above the price levels set out in the undertakings accepted in 1983. From 1984, however, these prices proved to be insufficient substantially to remedy the injury suffered by the Community producers.
(21) As a result, the Community outboard motor industry continued to incur losses, which increased, in particular, in 1985. Furthermore, employment in this industry decreased by another 7 % from 1983 to 1985 and declined by another 20 % due to dismissals already notified to personnel during the investigation period.
(22) The Commission considered whether injury has been caused by other factors, in particular the volume of imports of outboard motors from other third countries. It was found, however, that those imports declined from 12 964 units in 1983 to 7 612 units in 1985 with a consequent reduction in market share from 8 % to 5,6 %. The Commission, therefore, determined that the effects of the dumped imports of outboard motors originating in Japan, taken in isolation, have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community industry concerned.
(23) The above findings with regard to injury may be confirmed.
H. Community interest
(24) During the course of its investigation the Commission received submissions from two associations representing boat builders in two of the Member States. Those submissions warned, in general terms, against the negative effects on the boat building industry of any price increase for outboard motors.
(25) The Commission asked both associations further to substantiate their arguments, in particular with regard to exact figures relating, e.g. to price increases for boats, the development of price ratios between boats and outboard motors as well as financial losses and reduction in employment. The subsequent replies did not provide such figures, but only reiterated the general concern and pointed to the adverse effect of protective measures on importers of, and dealers in, outboard motors.
(26) In weighing these arguments, which remained unsubstantiated for the most part, against the serious difficulties still facing the Community outboard motor industry, the Council has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interest that action be taken.
I. Undertakings
(27) The exporters concerned were informed of the main findings of the investigation and commented on them. Unterdakings were subsequently offered by Honda Motor Co, Suzuki Motor Co, Tohatsu Corporation, including undertakings offered by Marine Power Europe Inc and Nissan Motor Nederland BV on behalf of Tohatsu Corporation, and Yamaha Motor Co, including an undertaking by Marine Power Europe Inc on behalf of Yamaha Motor Co.
These undertakings, which provide for price increases sufficient to eliminate injury to the Community industry, have been accepted by Commission Decision 87/210/EEC (1).
J. Definitive duty
(28) In the light of the above determination of the facts and in view of the possibility that exports of the product concerned to the Community might be taken up by exporters not presently covered by undertakings, the Council finds it appropriate to retain the definitive duty introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 2809/83. The investigation has shown
that, in order to allow Community producers a reasonable return on their sales of outboard motors, price increases of up to 22 % are necessary for outboard motors exported in the Community from Japan. Consequently, the Council determines that the rate of the definitive duty should remain at 22 % of the cif price, duty unpaid.
(29) Following a reduction in the model range proceeded by the Community industry, the scope of the present investigation has been limited to outboard motors of up to 26 kW (35 hp) as set out in recitals 4 to 6 above. Therefore, the definitive duty should apply to outboard motors of up to 26 kW (35 hp) only.
(30) In view of the new facts established during the present investigation, Regulation (EEC) No 2809/83 should be replaced by this Regulation.","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1305/87 of 11 May 1987 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on certain imports of outboard motors originating in Japan', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

(1) Article 27(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2200/96 provides that an intervention threshold is to be set if the market in a product listed in Annex II thereto is suffering or at risk of suffering from widespread structural imbalances giving or liable to give rise to too large a volume of withdrawals.
(2) An intervention threshold for apples was set for the 1999/2000 marketing year in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1541/1999(3). Since the conditions laid down in the abovementioned Article 27 continue to be met for that product, an intervention threshold for apples should be set for the 2000/01 marketing year.
(3) The intervention threshold for apples should be set on the basis of a percentage of the average quantity of produce, intended for consumption fresh, of the last five marketing years for which data are available. The period to be taken into account for assessing the overrun of the threshold should also be determined.
(4) Pursuant to the abovementioned Article 27, an overrun of the intervention threshold results in a reduction in the Community withdrawal compensation in the marketing year following the year in which the threshold is exceeded. The consequences of such an overrun should be determined and a reduction in proportion to the size of the overrun set.
(5) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fresh Fruit and Vegetables,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1511/2000 of 12 July 2000 setting the intervention threshold for apples for the 2000/01 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on certain measures for the purpose of the conservation of fish stocks in relation to countries allowing non-sustainable fishing (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 of 20 August 2013 establishing measures in respect of the Faeroe Islands to ensure the conservation of the Atlanto-Scandian herring stock (2) identifies the Faroe Islands as a country allowing non-sustainable fishing and adopts certain measures regarding the fishery for Atlanto-Scandian herring and its associated species, pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012.
(2) Article 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1026/2012 provides that such measures shall cease to apply when the country allowing non-sustainable fishing adopts, autonomously or within consultations, appropriate corrective measures for the conservation and management of the stock of common interest which do not undermine the effect of measures taken by the Union.
(3) By announcement of the Faroese Minister for Fisheries of 12 June 2014, the Faroe Islands have adopted a catch limit of 40 000 t of herring for 2014, a figure which, in absolute and relative terms, is well below the catch limit of 105 230 t adopted for 2013. This would increase by 4,4 % the overall TAC for 2014 proposed by the other coastal States under the existing long-term management plan.
(4) According to the most recent scientific advice, the estimated effect of this increase in catch in 2014 on the biomass of herring by the beginning of 2015 would only be 0,4 %, a figure that can be considered non-significant in terms of conservation of the stock.
(5) The corrective measure adopted by the Faroe Islands, when taken together with the shares adopted jointly by the other coastal States, i.e. Russian Federation, Norway, Iceland and the Union, will not therefore undermine the conservation efforts agreed between the EU and the other coastal States.
(6) As a consequence, the measures adopted by the Commission under Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 should cease to apply in accordance with Article 7(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1026/2012. Implementing Regulation (EU) No 793/2013 should thus be repealed.
(7) As continuing the application of those measures is not required, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.
(8) This is without prejudice to the future quotas to be set by the Faroe Islands or to the forthcoming coastal state consultations on the joint management of Atlanto-Scandian herring.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/642/EEC of 27 November 1990 on the fixing of maximum levels for pesticide residues in and on certain products of plant origin, including fruit and vegetables (1), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The rapporteur Member State informed the Commission that it might be necessary to revise the MRLs for diazinon in Directive 90/642/EEC in the light of concerns about consumer intake. Proposals for the review of Community MRLs were submitted to the Commission.
(2) Community MRLs and the levels recommended by the Codex Alimentarius are fixed and evaluated following similar procedures. There are a number Codex MRLs for diazinon. The Community MRLs based on Codex MRLs have also been evaluated by the rapporteur Member State in the light of the new information on the risk for the consumers.
(3) The lifetime and short-term exposure of consumers to diazinon via food products has been reassessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation (2). On that basis, it is appropriate to fix new MRLs, which will ensure that there is no unacceptable consumer exposure.
(4) Where relevant, the acute exposure of consumers to diazinon via each of the food products that may contain residues has been assessed and evaluated in accordance with Community procedures and practices, taking account of guidelines published by the World Health Organisation. It is concluded that the presence of pesticide residues at or below the new MRLs will not cause acute toxic effects.
(5) It is therefore necessary to modify the MRLs set out in Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC, to allow for proper surveillance and control of the prohibition of their uses and to protect the consumer.
(6) Through the World Trade Organisation, the Community’s trading partners have been consulted about the new MRLs and their comments on these levels have been taken into account.
(7) Annex II to Directive 90/642/EEC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '27.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 165/25', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2007/39/EC\nof 26 June 2007\namending Annex II to Council Directive 90/642/EEC as regards maximum residue levels for diazinon\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The rapporteur Member State informed the Commission that it might be necessary to revise the MRLs for diazinon in Directive 90/642/EEC in the light of concerns about consumer intake.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Articles 14(1) and 24(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The complete, consistent, transparent and accurate monitoring and reporting of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in accordance with the guidelines laid down in this Decision are fundamental for the operation of the greenhouse gas emission allowance trading scheme (EU ETS) established by Directive 2003/87/EC in relation to installations included in the EU ETS pursuant to Article 24 of that Directive in respect of their emissions of N2O.
(2) The monitoring and reporting guidelines set out in the Commission Decision 2007/589/EC of 18 July 2007 establishing guidelines for the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2) do not cover emissions of N2O.
(3) The Netherlands have applied to include N2O emissions from nitric acid plants in the EU ETS for the period 2008-2012.
(4) Specific guidelines for the determination of N2O emissions by continuous emission measurement systems should therefore be added.
(5) The global warming potential of 1 tonne of N2O for emissions during the period 2008-2012 should be considered to be equivalent to 310 tonnes of carbon dioxide, which is the value provided in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Second Assessment Report (1995 IPCC GWP value). This value should be used in order for there to be absolute consistency between reports by installations and by Member States reporting their national emissions inventories under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol.
(6) Decision 2007/589/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

This includes:\n—\nnitric acid production — N\n2\nO emissions from the catalytic oxidation of ammonia and/or from the NO\nx\n/N\n2\nO abatement units,\n—\nadipic acid production — N\n2\nO emissions, including from the oxidation reaction, any direct process venting and/or any emissions control equipment,\n—\nglyoxal and glyoxylic acid production — N\n2\nO emissions, including from the process reactions, any direct process venting and/or any emissions control equipment,\n—\ncaprolactam production — N\n2\nO emissions, including from the process reactions, any direct process venting and/or any emissions control equipment.\nThese provisions are not applicable to any N\n2\nO emissions from combustion of fuels.\nAny relevant CO\n2\nemissions directly associated with the production process (and not already covered under the EU ETS) that are included in the installation’s greenhouse gas emission permit shall be monitored and reported in accordance with these guidelines.\nAnnex I, Section 16 does not apply to the monitoring of N\n2\nO emissions.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0DETERMINATION OF CO\n2(e)\nAND N\n2\nO EMISSIONS\n2.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0ANNUAL N\n2\nO EMISSIONS\nEmissions of N\n2\nO from nitric acid production shall be measured using continuous emissions measurement (excluding for\nde minimis\nsources — Section 6.3).\nEmissions of N\n2\nO from adipic acid, caprolactam, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production shall be monitored using continuous emissions measurement for abated emissions and the calculation method (based on a mass balance approach (Section 2.6)) for temporary occurrences of unabated emissions.\nTotal annual N\n2\nO emissions from the installation are the sum of annual N\n2\nO emissions from all its emission sources.\nFor each emission source where continuous emissions measurement is applied, the total annual emissions are the sum of all hourly emissions using the following formula:\nWhere:\nN\n2\nO emissions\nannual\n=\ntotal annual emissions of N\n2\nO from the emission source in tonnes N\n2\nO\nN\n2\nO conc\nhourly\n=\nhourly concentrations of N\n2\nO in mg/Nm\n3\nin the flue gas flow measured during operation\nFlue gas flow\n=\nflue gas flow as calculated below in Nm\n3\n/h for each hourly concentration\n2.2.\xa0\xa0\xa0HOURLY N\n2\nO EMISSIONS\nAnnual average hourly N\n2\nO emissions for each source where continuous emission measurement is applied shall be calculated using the following equation:\nWhere:\nN\n2\nO emissions\nav hourly\n=\nannual average hourly N\n2\nO emissions in kg/h from the source\nN\n2\nO conc\nhourly\n=\nhourly concentrations of N\n2\nO in mg/Nm\n3\nin the flue gas flow measured during operation\nFlue gas flow\n=\nflue gas flow as calculated below in Nm\n3\n/h for each hourly concentration\nThe total uncertainty of the annual hourly average emissions for each emission source must not exceed the tier values as set out below. The highest tier approach shall be used by all operators. Only if it is shown to the satisfaction of the competent authority that the highest tier is not technically feasible or will lead to unreasonably high costs, may a next lower tier be used. For the reporting period 2008–12 as a minimum Tier 2 shall be applied unless technically not feasible.\nIn cases for which it is technically not feasible or would lead to unreasonable costs to apply at least Tier 1 requirements for each emission source (except\nde minimis\nsources), the operator shall apply and demonstrate compliance with the appropriate tier for the total annual emission for the emission source as in Section 2, Annex XII. For the reporting period 2008–12 the minimum requirement is Tier 2, unless technically not feasible. Respective installations applying this approach are to be notified by Member States to the Commission pursuant to Article 21 of Directive 2003/87/EC.\nTier 1:\nFor each emission source a total uncertainty of annual average hourly emissions of less than\xa0±\xa010\xa0% shall be achieved.\nTier 2:\nFor each emission source a total uncertainty of annual average hourly emissions of less than\xa0±\xa07,5\xa0% shall be achieved.\nTier 3:\nFor each emission source a total uncertainty of annual average hourly emissions of less than\xa0±\xa05\xa0% shall be achieved.\n2.3.\xa0\xa0\xa0HOURLY N\n2\nO CONCENTRATIONS\nHourly N\n2\nO concentrations [mg/Nm\n3\n] in the flue gas from each emission source shall be determined by continuous measurement at a representative point, after the NO\nx\n/N\n2\nO abatement equipment (if abatement is used).\nSuitable measuring techniques include IR Spectroscopy, but others can be used in accordance with paragraph 2 of Section 6.1 of Annex I, provided they achieve the required uncertainty level for the N\n2\nO emissions. The used techniques must be capable of measuring N\n2\nO concentrations of all emission sources during both abated and unabated conditions (for example during periods when abatement equipment fails and concentrations increase). If uncertainties increase during such periods, these must be taken into account in the uncertainty assessment.\nAll measurements shall be adjusted to a dry gas basis and be reported consistently.\n2.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0DETERMINATION OF FLUE GAS FLOW\nThe methods for monitoring flue gas flow set out in Annex XII shall be used for measuring flue gas flow for N\n2\nO emissions monitoring.\nFor nitric acid production, Method A shall be applied unless it is not technically feasible, in which case an alternative method, such as a mass balance approach based on significant parameters (such as ammonia input load) or determination of flow by continuous emissions flow measurement, can be used provided it is approved by the competent authority as part of the evaluation of the monitoring plan and the monitoring methodology therein.\nFor other activities, other methods for monitoring flue gas flow described in Annex XII can be used, provided they are approved by the competent authority as part of the evaluation of the monitoring plan and the monitoring methodology therein.\nMethod A — nitric acid production\nThe flue gas flow shall be calculated in accordance with the following formula:\nWhere:\nV\nair\n=\ntotal input air flow in Nm\n3\n/h at standard conditions;\nO\n2 air\n=\nvolume fraction of O\n2\nin dry air [=\xa00,2095];\nO\n2 flue gas\n=\nvolume fraction of O\n2\nin flue gas.\nThe V\nair\nshall be calculated as the sum of all air flows entering the nitric acid production unit.\nThe installation shall apply the following formula, unless stated otherwise in its monitoring plan:\nV\nair\n= V\nprim\n+\xa0V\nsec\n+\xa0V\nseal\nWhere:\nV\nprim\n=\nPrimary input air flow in Nm\n3\n/h at standard conditions;\nV\nsec\n=\nSecondary input air flow in Nm\n3\n/h at standard conditions;\nV\nseal\n=\nSeal input air flow in Nm\n3\n/h at standard conditions.\nThe V\nprim\nis determined by continuous flow measurement before the mixing with ammonia takes place. The V\nsec\nis determined by continuous flow measurement e.g. before the heat recovery unit. The V\nseal\nis the purged airflow within the nitric acid production process (if relevant).\nFor input air streams accounting for cumulatively less than 2,5\xa0% of the total air flow, the competent authority may accept estimation methods for determination of this air flow rate proposed by the operator based on industry best practices.\nThe operator shall provide evidence through measurements under normal operation conditions that the flue gas flow measured is sufficiently homogeneous to allow for the proposed measurement method. If non-homogeneous flow is confirmed through these measurements, this must be taken into account when determining appropriate monitoring methods and when calculating the uncertainty in the N\n2\nO emissions.\nAll measurements shall be adjusted to a dry gas basis and be reported consistently.\n2.5.\xa0\xa0\xa0OXYGEN (O\n2\n)\nOxygen concentrations in the flue gas shall be measured if needed for calculating the flue gas flow according to Section 2.4. Requirements described for concentration measurements within Section 6 of Annex I shall apply. Suitable measurement techniques include: paramagnetic alternating pressure, magnetic torsion balance or zirconium dioxide probe. Uncertainty of O\n2\nconcentration measurements shall be taken into account in determining the uncertainty in the N\n2\nO emissions.\nAll measurements shall be adjusted to a dry gas basis and be reported consistently.\n2.6.\xa0\xa0\xa0CALCULATION OF N\n2\nO EMISSIONS\nFor specific periodic, unabated emissions of N\n2\nO from adipic acid, caprolactam, glyoxal and glyoxylic acid production (such as unabated emissions from venting for safety reasons and/or when abatement plant fails) where continuous emissions monitoring of N\n2\nO is not technically feasible, calculation of N\n2\nO emissions using a mass balance approach can be applied. The calculation method shall be based on the maximum potential emission rate of N\n2\nO from the chemical reaction taking place at the time and the period of the emission. The specific calculation approach shall be approved by the competent authority as part of the evaluation of the monitoring plan and the monitoring methodology therein.\nThe uncertainty in any calculated emissions for a specific emission source shall be taken into account in determining the annual average hourly uncertainty for the emission source. The same tiers as for emissions measured entirely with continuous emissions measurement shall be applied to calculated emissions, or where a combination of calculation and continuous measurement are used to determine N\n2\nO emissions.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0CALCULATION OF ANNUAL CO\n2\nEQUIVALENTS (CO\n2(e)\n)\nThe total annual N\n2\nO emissions from all emissions sources (measured in tonnes to three decimal places) shall be converted to annual CO\n2(e)\nemissions (rounded tonnes) using the following formula:\nFor emissions during the period 2008–12, the Global Warming Potential GWP\nN2O\n= 310 t CO\n2(e)\n/t N\n2\nO shall be used, which is the value provided in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Second Assessment Report (1995 IPCC GWP value).\nThe total annual CO\n2(e)\ngenerated by all emission sources and any direct CO\n2\nemissions from other emission sources (if included in the greenhouse gas permit) shall be added to the total annual CO\n2\nemissions generated by the installation and shall be used for reporting and surrendering allowances.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0DETERMINATION OF ACTIVITY PRODUCTION RATES\nProduction rates shall be calculated using daily production reports and hours of operation.\n5.\xa0\xa0\xa0MONITORING PLAN\nIn addition to requirements set out in Annex I, Section 4.3(a), (b), (c), (d), (j), (k), (m) and (n), monitoring plans for installations covered by this Annex shall contain the following information:\n(a)\nall relevant emissions points during typical operation, and during restrictive and transition phases (e.g. breakdown periods or commissioning phases) shown in a process diagram;\n(b)\nthe method and parameters used to determine the quantity of materials (e.g. ammonia) used in the production process and the maximum quantity of material used at full capacity;\n(c)\nthe method and parameters used to determine the quantity of product produced as an hourly load, expressed as nitric acid (100\xa0%), adipic acid (100\xa0%), glyoxal and glyoxylic acid and caprolactam per hour respectively;\n(d)\nthe method and parameters used to determine the N\n2\nO concentration in the flue gas from each emission source, its operating range, and its uncertainty, and details of any alternative methods to be applied if concentrations fall outside the operating range and the situations when this may occur;\n(e)\nthe method used to determine the total flue gas flow rate (expressed in Nm\n3\nper hour) from each emission source, its operating range and its uncertainty.

If missing data occur during failure of abatement equipment, it shall be assumed that emissions for that whole hour were unabated and substitute values calculated accordingly.\nThe operator shall take all practical steps to ensure that continuous emissions monitoring equipment is not out of operation for more than one week in any calendar year. If this occurs, the operator shall inform the competent authority immediately.\n6.3.\nDE MINIMIS\nSOURCES OF N\n2\nO\n‘\nDe minimis\nsource streams’ for N\n2\nO emission sources means one or more minor, unabated source streams selected by the operator and jointly emitting 1\xa0000 tonnes of CO\n2(e)\nor less per year, or that emit less that 20\xa0000 tonnes of CO\n2(e)\nper year and contribute less than 2\xa0% of the total annual emissions of CO\n2(e)\nof that installation.\nSubject to approval by the competent authority, the operator may apply approaches for monitoring and reporting using his own no-tier estimation method for\nde minimis\nsource streams of N\n2\nO.\n6.4.\xa0\xa0\xa0CORROBORATING CALCULATION OF EMISSIONS\nAnnex I, Section 6.3(c) shall apply to corroborating reported emissions of N\n2\nO (from continuous emissions measurement and calculation) and performed using production data, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and the approach specified in Annex I, Section 10.3.3 “Horizontal approach”.\n7.\xa0\xa0\xa0UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENTS\nUncertainty assessments required to demonstrate compliance with relevant tiers in Section 2 shall be determined by means of an error propagation calculation taking into account the uncertainty of all relevant elements of the emission calculation. For the continuous measurement the following sources of uncertainty should be assessed in accordance with EN 14181 and ISO 14956:2002:\n—\nthe specified uncertainty of continuous measurement equipment, including sampling,\n—\nuncertainties associated to the calibration, and\n—\nadditional uncertainty connected to how the monitoring equipment is used in practice.\nFor the calculation of the total uncertainty to be used in Section 2.2, hourly N\n2\nO concentrations as determined pursuant to Section 2.3 shall be used. For the purpose of uncertainty calculation only, hourly N\n2\nO concentrations below 20 mg/Nm\n3\nshall be substituted by a default value of 20 mg/Nm\n3\n.\nThe operator, via the quality assurance and control process, shall manage and reduce the remaining uncertainties of the emissions data in his emissions report. During the verification process, the verifier shall check the correct application of the approved monitoring methodology, and shall assess the management and reduction of remaining uncertainties via the operator’s quality assurance and control procedures.\n8.\xa0\xa0\xa0CONTROL AND VERIFICATION\n8.1.\xa0\xa0\xa0CONTROL\nIn addition to the requirements in Annex I, Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3, the following quality assurance procedures shall apply:\n—\nquality assurance of the continuous measurements of the concentration of N\n2\nO and oxygen shall take place in accordance with EN 14181,\n—\nthe installed measurement equipment shall be calibrated by means of parallel measurements once every three years,\n—\nwhere emission limit values (ELVs) are typically used as the basis for calibration of continuous emissions monitors, and where no ELV exists for N\n2\nO or O\n2\n, then the annual average hourly concentration shall be used as a proxy for such ELVs,\n—\nthe QAL 2 should be done with suitable reference gases in addition to the sample gas, to ensure that a wide enough calibration range is assessed,\n—\nthe measurement equipment that measures the flue gas flow volume shall be calibrated annually or when the plant is maintained, whichever is sooner.

fixing an adjustment rate for direct payments provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2014
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 352/78, (EC) No 165/94, (EC) No 2799/98, (EC) No 814/2000, (EC) No 1290/2005 and (EC) No 485/2008 (1), and in particular Article 26(3) thereof,
After consulting the Committee on the Agricultural Funds,
Whereas:
(1) Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation.
(2) Article 26(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that in order to ensure that the annual ceilings set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (2) for the financing of the market related expenditure and direct payments are respected, an adjustment rate for direct payments has to be determined when the forecasts for the financing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.
(3) The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, taken into account in the Commission 2015 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 433 million in current prices. To cover this amount, the financial discipline mechanism has to apply to direct payments listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 (3) in respect of calendar year 2014.
(4) The forecasts for the direct payments and market related expenditure determined in the Commission 2015 Draft Budget indicated that there is no need for any further financial discipline.
(5) Acting in accordance with Article 26(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on fixing an adjustment rate for direct payments provided for in Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2014 (4) on 21 March 2014.
(6) The European Parliament and the Council have not determined that adjustment rate by 30 June 2014. Therefore, in accordance with Article 26(3) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the Commission is to fix the adjustment rate by means of an implementing act and inform the European Parliament and the Council immediately thereof.
(7) In accordance with Article 26(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013, the adjustment rate may be adapted by the Commission until 1 December 2014, on the basis of new information in its possession. In the event of new information, the Commission will take it into account and will adopt an implementing regulation adapting the adjustment rate by 1 December 2014, in the context of the Amending Letter to the Draft Budget 2015.
(8) As a general rule, farmers submitting an aid application for direct payments for one calendar year (N) are paid within a fixed payment period falling under the financial year (N + 1). However, Member States have the possibility to make late payments, within certain limits, to farmers beyond this payment period without any time limits. Such late payments may fall in a later financial year. When financial discipline is applied for a given calendar year, the adjustment rate should not be applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the calendar years other than that for which the financial discipline applies. Therefore, in order to ensure equal treatment of farmers, it is appropriate to provide that the adjustment rate is only applied to payments for which aid applications have been submitted in the calendar year for which the financial discipline is applied, irrespectively of when the payment to farmers is made.
(9) Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 applies only to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate applies only to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. The adjustment rate to be determined by the present Regulation should therefore not apply to payments to farmers in those Member States,","{'header': '13.8.2014 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 240/20', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 879/2014\nof 12 August 2014\nfixing an adjustment rate for direct payments provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 in respect of calendar year 2014', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation.\n\n((2)) Article 26(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 lays down that in order to ensure that the annual ceilings set out in Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013(2)for the financing of the market related expenditure and direct payments are respected, an adjustment rate for direct payments has to be determined when the forecasts for the financing of the measures financed under that sub-ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings will be exceeded.\n\n((3)) The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, taken into account in the Commission 2015 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 433 million in current prices.

COUNCIL DECISION
of 7 July 2009
on the existence of an excessive deficit in Poland
(2009/589/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(6) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Having regard to the observations made by Poland,
Whereas:
(1) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.
(2) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.
(3) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (1), which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit. The Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty sets out further provisions relating to the implementation of the EDP. Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 (2) lays down detailed rules and definitions for the application of the provisions of that Protocol.
(4) The 2005 reform of the Stability and Growth Pact sought to strengthen its effectiveness and economic underpinnings as well as to safeguard the sustainability of public finances in the long run. It aimed at ensuring that, in particular, the economic and budgetary background was taken into account fully in all steps in the EDP. In this way, the Stability and Growth Pact provides the framework supporting government policies for a prompt return to sound budgetary positions taking account of the economic situation.
(5) Article 104(5) of the Treaty requires the Commission to address an opinion to the Council if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit in a Member State exists or may occur. Having taken into account its report in accordance with Article 104(3) of the Treaty and having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Financial Committee in accordance with Article 104(4) of the Treaty, the Commission concluded that an excessive deficit exists in Poland. The Commission therefore addressed such an opinion to the Council in respect of Poland on 24 June 2009 (3).
(6) Article 104(6) of the Treaty states that the Council should consider any observations which the Member State concerned may wish to make before deciding, after an overall assessment, whether an excessive deficit exists. In the case of Poland, this overall assessment leads to the conclusion set out in this Decision.
(7) According to the April 2009 EDP notification by the Polish authorities, subsequently validated by Eurostat, the general government deficit in Poland reached 3,9 % of GDP in 2008, thus exceeding the 3 % of GDP reference value. The deficit was not close to the 3 % of GDP reference value and the excess over the reference value cannot be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. In particular, it does not result from an unusual event within the meaning of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. Moreover, it does not result from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. Despite growth slowing down to 3,3 % year-on-year in the last quarter of 2008, which affected revenue collection in the last quarter of the year and added to the worse-than-expected deficit outcome, overall GDP growth was still relatively robust at 4,9 % in 2008.
(8) General government gross debt remains below the 60 % of GDP reference value and stood at 47,1 % of GDP in 2008. However, due to high expected deficits, the general government debt is likely to reach almost 60 % on a no-policy-change assumption in 2010 according to the Commission’s spring 2009 forecast.
(9) In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully-funded pillar. While the implementation of these reforms leads to a temporary deterioration of the budgetary position, the long-term sustainability of public finances clearly improves. Based on the estimates of the Polish authorities, the net cost of this reform amounted to 2,9 % of GDP in 2008, rising to 3,2 % of GDP in 2009, as recalled by the Polish authorities in their letter of 22 June. According to the Stability and Growth Pact, these can be taken into account on a linear degressive basis for a transitory period and only where the deficit remains close to the reference value. Since the deficit does not remain close to the reference value in 2008-2010, the cost of the pension reform cannot be taken into account.
(10) According to Article 2(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1467/97, ‘relevant factors’ can only be taken into account in the steps leading to the Council decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty if the double condition — that the deficit remains close to the reference value and that its excess over the reference value is temporary — is fully met. In the case of Poland, this double condition is not met. Therefore, relevant factors are not taken into account in the steps leading to this Decision,","{'header': '4.8.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 202/46', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 7 July 2009\non the existence of an excessive deficit in Poland\n(2009/589/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) According to Article 104 of the Treaty Member States shall avoid excessive government deficits.\n\n((2)) The Stability and Growth Pact is based on the objective of sound government finances as a means of strengthening the conditions for price stability and for strong sustainable growth conducive to employment creation.\n\n((3)) The excessive deficit procedure (EDP) under Article 104 of the Treaty, as clarified by Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(1), which is part of the Stability and Growth Pact, provides for a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit.

The deficit was not close to the 3\xa0% of GDP reference value and the excess over the reference value cannot be qualified as exceptional within the meaning of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact.

Moreover, it does not result from a severe economic downturn in the sense of the Treaty and of the Stability and Growth Pact. Despite growth slowing down to 3,3\xa0% year-on-year in the last quarter of 2008, which affected revenue collection in the last quarter of the year and added to the worse-than-expected deficit outcome, overall GDP growth was still relatively robust at 4,9\xa0% in 2008.Potential GDP growth is estimated to be of the order of 4\xa0½\xa0% and the output gap to have reached about 3\xa0½\xa0% of potential GDP, indicating favourable cyclical conditions. Furthermore, the excess over the reference value cannot be considered temporary. According to the Commission services’ spring 2009 forecast, the general government deficit is expected to reach 6,6\xa0% of GDP in 2009 and, on a no-policy-change assumption, 7,3\xa0% in 2010 against a GDP contraction of 1,4\xa0% in 2009 and GDP growth of 0,8\xa0% in 2010. The deficit will increase in 2009 also according to the Polish authorities which, on 22 June 2009, announced that the general government deficit may significantly exceed the 4,6\xa0% of GDP planned for the current year in the Spring 2009 EDP notification(4). Therefore, the deficit criterion in the Treaty is not fulfilled.\n\n((8)) General government gross debt remains below the 60\xa0% of GDP reference value and stood at 47,1\xa0% of GDP in 2008. However, due to high expected deficits, the general government debt is likely to reach almost 60\xa0% on a no-policy-change assumption in 2010 according to the Commission’s spring 2009 forecast.\n\n((9)) In accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact, due consideration should be given to systemic pension reforms introducing a multi-pillar system that includes a mandatory, fully-funded pillar.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas the technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate inter alia to their direction indicator lamps;
Whereas those requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in order, in particular, to allow the EEC type-approval procedure which was the subject of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (3), to be introduced in respect of each type of vehicle;
Whereas in Directive 76/756/EEC (4), the Council laid down the common requirements for the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers;
Whereas a harmonized type-approval procedure for direction indicator lamps makes it possible for each Member State to check compliance with the common construction and testing requirements and to inform the other Member States of its findings by sending a copy of the component type-approval certificate completed for each type of direction indicator lamp ; whereas the placing of an EEC component type-approval mark on all direction indicator lamps manufactured in conformity with the approved type obviates any need for technical checks on these direction indicator lamps in the other Member States;
Whereas, it is desirable to take into account the technical requirements adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe in its Regulation No 6 (""Uniform provisions for the approval of direction indicators for motor vehicles (except motor cycles) and their trailers"") (5), which is annexed to the Agreement of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform conditions for approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicle equipment and parts;

Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) Vitamin E was authorised without time limit as a feed additive for use in all animal species by Directive 70/524/EEC as part of the group ‘Vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect’. That additive was subsequently entered in the Register of feed additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 of that Regulation, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of vitamin E as a feed additive for all animal species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’. The application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concluded in its opinion of 25 May 2010 that, under the proposed conditions of use, vitamin E does not have an adverse effect on animal health, consumer health or the environment (3). It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of vitamin E shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that additive should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since the modifications on the conditions of the authorisation are not related to safety reasons, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the premixtures and compound feed.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 379 thereof,
Having regard to the application by Ireland,
Whereas Ireland, by letter of 15 November 1995, applied to the Commission for authorization to invoke Article 379 of the Act of Accession for safeguard measures, aimed at solving the problem caused by the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, concerning pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected in Ireland by a product patent but not in Spain;
Whereas in their request, the Irish authorities provided the Commission with the material facts to enable it to evaluate the validity of the application;
Whereas the Irish authorities base their application upon the economic difficulties to which the pharmaceutical products market would be subjected as a result of the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, namely as from 7 October 1995; whereas they argue that since the price of pharmaceuticals on the Spanish market is lower by, on average, 50 % than the observed price for the same speciality products on the Irish market, the expiry of the transitional period will lead to an appreciable increase in parallel imports from Spain into Ireland;
Whereas Article 379 derogates from a fundamental principle of the EC Treaty, that of the free movement of goods; whereas consequently in accordance with the well-established case-law of the Court of Justice it should be restrictively interpreted;
Whereas consequently, in accordance with that case-law and with the established practice of the Commission in the past, Article 379 cannot apply;
Whereas the purpose of Article 379 is to rectify and adjust to the economy of the common market a given economic sector experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist;
Whereas an analysis of the economic data provided by the Irish authorities has shown that the conditions for the application of Article 379 are not fulfilled; whereas, more particularly, it has revealed that the Irish pharmaceutical industry is not experiencing economic difficulties which are serious and liable to persist; whereas an increase in the volume of imports coming from Spain of pharmaceutical products patented in Ireland but not in Spain would not appear to be so significant in the long run as to bring about, by itself, serious economic difficulties on the Irish pharmaceutical market,","{'title': ""96/323/EC: Commission Decision of 20 December 1995 refusing Ireland's application for protective measures with regard to pharmaceutical products coming from Spain (Only the English text is authentic)"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe application for safeguard measures made by Ireland under Article 379 of the Act of Accession, aimed at solving the problem caused by the expiry of the transitional period provided for by Article 47 of the Act of Accession, concerning pharmaceutical products coming from Spain, which are protected by a product patent in Ireland but not in Spain, is rejected.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to Ireland.\n\nDone at Brussels, 20 December 1995.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nMario MONTI\n\nMember of the Commission'}]}"

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 (2) lays down the procedure and conditions for the sale of cereals held by intervention agencies.
(2) In Member States which do not have sea ports, tenderers for cereals put up for sale are penalized by higher transport costs. As a result of these additional costs, cereals are more difficult to export from those Member States, which results in particular in longer intervention storage and additional costs to the Community budget. Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 therefore provides for the possibility, in certain cases, of financing the lowest transport costs between the place of storage and the place of exit, in order to make the tenders comparable.
(3) The Croation ports of Rijeka and Split were traditional ports of exit for the countries of central Europe before their accession to the Union. Rijeka and Split should therefore be included among the places of exit that can be considered when calculating the refundable transport costs for exports.
(4) In order to simplify and harmonise the procedures for the placing on sale of cereals for export, the procedure for releasing the guarantees referred to in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 2131/93 should be clarified, based on Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (3), especially as regards the proof that the import customs formalities have been completed in a third country.

Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 96/23/EC, of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products and repealing Directives 85/358/EEC and 86/469/EEC(3), provides that aquaculture products shall be included in the monitoring plan for residues of veterinary drugs.
(2) Furthermore, the Annex of Commission Decision 2000/159/EC of 8 February 2000 on the provisional approval of residue plants of third countries according to Council Directive 96/23/EC(4), as last amended by Commission Decision 2000/675/EC(5), indicates the third countries which have submitted a plan, setting out the guarantees which it offers as regards the monitoring of the groups of residues and substances referred to in Annex I of Directive 96/23/EC.
(3) Consequently, when the guarantees referred to in recital 2 are not provided, the imports of aquaculture products shall not be authorised, even if they are in compliance with the Council Directive 91/493/EC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products(6), as last amended by Directive 97/79/EC(7).
(4) Since Commission Decision 97/296/EC(8), as amended by Decision 2001/40/EC(9), lists the countries and territories from which importation of fishery products for human consumption is authorised, it is necessary to modify this Decision to include the requirement that the import of aquaculture products shall only be authorised from those third countries listed in both Decisions: 97/296/EC and 2000/159/EC.
(5) However, as Commission Decision 95/328/EC of 25 July 1995 establishing health certification for fishery products from third countries which are not yet covered by a specific decision(10), as last amended by Decision 2001/67/EC(11), provides a transitional period for the up-dating of the model of health certification, it is necessary to provide a derogation in the application of the Decision 2000/159/EC for aquaculture products, during this transitional period.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.
(2) In accordance with Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of that Regulation.
(3) The application concerns authorisation of the preparation of potassium diformate (Formi LHS) as a feed additive for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening, to be classified in the additive category ‘zootechnical additives’.
(4) The method of analysis included in the application for authorisation in accordance with Article 7(3)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 concerns the determination of the active substance of the feed additive in feed. The method of analysis referred to in the Annex to this Regulation is therefore not to be understood as a Community method of analysis within the meaning of Article 11 of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules (2).
(5) The European Food Safety Authority (the Authority) concludes in its opinion of 14 February 2006 (3) that the safety of this additive for the consumer, the user and the environment have already been established and will not be changed by the proposed use. It further concludes, that the use of the preparation does not have an adverse effect on this animal category and that the use of that preparation can improve the zootechnical parameters (average daily intake gain, feed to gain ratio) for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening. It considers that the post market monitoring plan provided by the applicant is appropriate. The opinion of the Authority recommends appropriate measures for user safety. This opinion also verifies the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(6) The assessment of that preparation shows that the conditions for authorisation, provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that preparation should be authorised, as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(7) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1810/2005 of 4 November 2005 concerning a new authorisation for 10 years of an additive in feedingstuffs, the permanent authorisation of certain additives in feedingstuffs and the provisional authorisation of new uses of certain additives already authorised in feedingstuffs (4) which had provided for an authorisation for that use under the transitional provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 should therefore be deleted.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '1.3.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 63/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 184/2007\nof 20\xa0February 2007\nconcerning the authorisation of potassium diformate (Formi LHS) as a feed additive\n(text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No\xa01831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.\n\n((2)) In accordance with Article\xa07 of Regulation (EC) No\xa01831/2003, an application was submitted for the authorisation of the preparation set out in the Annex.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC (1), and in particular Article 13(2) and Article 78(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, Council Directive 91/414/EEC (2) is to apply, with respect to the procedure and the conditions for approval, to active substances for which a decision has been adopted in accordance with Article 6(3) of that Directive before 14 June 2011. For fluxapyroxad the conditions of Article 80(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 are fulfilled by Commission Decision 2010/672/EU (3).
(2) In accordance with Article 6(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC the United Kingdom received on 11 December 2009 an application from BASF SE for the inclusion of the active substance fluxapyroxad in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. Decision 2010/672/EU confirmed that the dossier was ‘complete’ in the sense that it could be considered as satisfying, in principle, the data and information requirements of Annexes II and III to Directive 91/414/EEC.
(3) For that active substance, the effects on human and animal health and the environment have been assessed, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6(2) and (4) of Directive 91/414/EEC, for the uses proposed by the applicant. The designated rapporteur Member State submitted a draft assessment report on 11 January 2011.
(4) The draft assessment report was peer reviewed by the Member States and the European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter ‘the Authority’). The Authority presented to the Commission its conclusion on the peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance fluxapyroxad (4) on 16 December 2011. The draft assessment report was reviewed by the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and was finalised on 1 June 2012 in the format of the Commission review report for fluxapyroxad.
(5) It has appeared from the various examinations made that plant protection products containing fluxapyroxad may be expected to satisfy, in general, the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) and Article 5(3) of Directive 91/414/EEC, in particular with regard to the uses which were examined and detailed in the Commission review report. It is therefore appropriate to approve fluxapyroxad.
(6) Without prejudice to the obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 as a consequence of approval, taking into account the specific situation created by the transition from Directive 91/414/EEC to Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 the following should, however, apply. Member States should be allowed a period of six months after approval to review authorisations of plant protection products containing fluxapyroxad. Member States should, as appropriate, vary, replace or withdraw authorisations. By way of derogation from that deadline, a longer period should be provided for the submission and assessment of the update of the complete Annex III dossier, as set out in Directive 91/414/EEC, of each plant protection product for each intended use in accordance with the uniform principles.
(7) The experience gained from inclusions in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC of active substances assessed in the framework of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3600/92 of 11 December 1992 laying down the detailed rules for the implementation of the first stage of the programme of work referred to in Article 8(2) of Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market (5) has shown that difficulties can arise in interpreting the duties of holders of existing authorisations in relation to access to data. In order to avoid further difficulties it therefore appears necessary to clarify the duties of the Member States, especially the duty to verify that the holder of an authorisation demonstrates access to a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive. However, this clarification does not impose any new obligations on Member States or holders of authorisations compared to the directives which have been adopted until now amending Annex I to that Directive or the Regulations approving active substances.
(8) In accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009, the Annex to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 540/2011 of 25 May 2011 implementing Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the list of approved active substances (6) should be amended accordingly.

amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to risk-sharing instruments for Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 177 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure (2),
Whereas:
(1) The unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States.
(2) Whilst important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments to the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens, is being widely felt.
(3) Pursuant to Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which provides for the possibility of granting Union financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties or seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused, inter alia, by exceptional occurrences beyond its control, Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010 (3) established a European financial stabilisation mechanism with a view to preserving the financial stability of the Union.
(4) By Council Implementing Decisions 2011/77/EU (4) and 2011/344/EU (5), Ireland and Portugal, respectively, were granted financial assistance under Regulation (EU) No 407/2010.
(5) Greece was already experiencing serious difficulties with respect to its financial stability before the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 407/2010. Financial assistance to Greece could not, therefore, be based on that Regulation.
(6) The Intercreditor Agreement and the Loan Facility Agreement for Greece, signed on 8 May 2010, entered into force on 11 May 2010. The Intercreditor Agreement is to remain in full force and effect for a three-year programme period, as long as there are any amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility Agreement.
(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States’ balances of payments (6) provides that the Council is to grant mutual assistance where a Member State which has not adopted the euro is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments.
(8) By Council Decisions 2009/102/EC (7) and 2009/459/EC (8), Hungary and Romania, respectively, were granted financial assistance under Regulation (EC) No 332/2002.
(9) On 11 July 2011, finance ministers of the 17 euro area Member States signed the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Following decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area on 21 July and 9 December 2011, the Treaty was modified in order to improve the effectiveness of the mechanism and signed on 2 February 2012. Under that Treaty, the ESM will, by 2013, assume the tasks currently fulfilled by the European Financial Stability Facility and the European financial stabilisation mechanism. The ESM should, therefore, be taken into account by this Regulation.
(10) In its conclusions of 23 and 24 June 2011, the European Council welcomed the Commission’s intention to enhance the synergies between the loan programme for Greece and the Union funds, and supported efforts to increase Greece’s capacity to absorb Union funds in order to stimulate growth and employment by refocusing on improving competitiveness and employment creation. Moreover, it welcomed and supported the preparation by the Commission, together with the Member States, of a comprehensive programme of technical assistance to Greece.
(11) In the Statement by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area and the EU institutions of 21 July 2011, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) were invited to enhance the synergies between loan programmes and Union funds in all countries under Union or International Monetary Fund assistance. This Regulation should contribute to that objective.
(12) In the Statement of the Members of the European Council of 30 January 2012, the Heads of State or Government agreed on strengthening EIB support for infrastructure as an urgent measure and invited the Council, the Commission and the EIB to consider possible options to enhance EIB action to support growth and to make appropriate recommendations, including possibilities for the general budget of the European Union to leverage EIB group financing capacity. This Regulation aims to respond to that invitation in the current crisis-management context.
(13) The implementation of operational programmes and projects in the field of infrastructure and productive investment in Greece faces serious problems because the conditions for the participation of the private sector and particularly of the financial sector have changed dramatically as a result of the economic and financial crisis.
(14) In order to alleviate those problems and to speed up the implementation of operational programmes and projects, as well as to strengthen the economic recovery, it is necessary that the Member States, which have experienced or have been threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and which have been granted financial assistance under one of the financial assistance mechanisms set out in Article 77(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (9) as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (10), may contribute financial resources from operational programmes to the establishment of risk-sharing instruments providing loans or guarantees or other financial facilities, in support of projects and operations provided for under an operational programme.
(15) In light of the EIB’s long-standing expertise as a major financier of infrastructure projects and its commitment to support economic recovery, the Commission should be able to establish risk-sharing instruments by means of a cooperation agreement concluded with the EIB for such a purpose. In order to provide legal certainty, it is necessary to set out the typical main terms and conditions of such a cooperation agreement in Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. As regards the specific crisis-management nature of risk-sharing instruments, as provided for under this Regulation, the specific terms and conditions of each cooperation should be laid down in an individual cooperation agreement, to be concluded between the Commission and the EIB in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (11).
(16) In view of the need to expand investment opportunities which may arise in the Member States concerned, the Commission should also be able to establish risk-sharing instruments with national or international public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public-service mission providing adequate guarantees, as referred to in Article 54(2)(c) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, under similar terms and conditions to those applied to and by the EIB.
(17) To respond rapidly in the context of the current economic, financial and social crisis, risk-sharing instruments under this Regulation should be implemented by the Commission in accordance with Article 54(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.
(18) In the interests of clarity and legal certainty, a definition of a risk-sharing instrument should be inserted in Article 36a of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as amended by this Regulation. Risk-sharing instruments should be used for loans and guarantees as well as for other financial facilities in order to finance operations, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund (CF), as regards investment costs which cannot be financed, as eligible expenditure pursuant to Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, or pursuant to the Union rules on State aids. For this purpose, it is also necessary to establish a derogation from Article 54(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.
(19) A Member State seeking to benefit from a risk-sharing instrument should clearly specify, in its written request to the Commission, why it considers that it meets one of the eligibility conditions of Article 77(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and it should attach to its request all the information required under this Regulation in order to prove the specified eligibility condition. In its request, the requesting Member State should also identify the programmes (including the list of project proposals and related funding needs) co-financed by the ERDF or the CF and the part of the 2012 and 2013 allocations to such programmes that it wants to allocate to the risk-sharing instrument. The Member State request should, therefore, be transmitted to the Commission, by 31 August 2013, with a view to the adoption of a Commission decision on the participation of the requesting Member State in a risk-sharing instrument by 31 December 2013. Before the Commission decision on the Member State request, the related operational programmes under the ERDF and the CF should be revised, in accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.
(20) Selected operations, eligible under a risk-sharing instrument, should be either major projects that have already been subject to a Commission decision under Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 or other projects, co-financed by the ERDF or the CF and falling under one or more of their operational programmes, where these projects face a lack of finance regarding the investment costs to be borne by private investors. Finally, selected operations could also be operations which contribute to the objectives of the national strategic reference framework of the requesting Member State and of the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion and which can, by virtue of their character, contribute to supporting growth, and strengthen the economic recovery, subject to availability of funds under the risk-sharing instrument.
(21) In addition, the requesting Member State should specify in its request the amount available for its exclusive benefit, within its cohesion policy financial allocation pursuant to Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and which can be earmarked for the objectives of the risk-sharing instrument exclusively from the Union budget commitments to be effected in the years 2012 and 2013, pursuant to Article 75(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and which should not exceed 10 % of the indicative total allocation for the requesting Member State for the years 2007-13 regarding the ERDF and the CF, and approved in accordance with Article 28(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Finally, it is necessary to ensure that Union financing of the risk-sharing instrument, including management fees and other eligible costs, is clearly limited to the above-specified maximum amount of the Union contribution to the risk-sharing instrument and there should be no additional contingent liability for the general budget of the European Union. Any residual risk inherent in the financed operations under the established risk-sharing instrument should, therefore, be borne either by the EIB or by the national or international public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, with which the risk-sharing instrument has been established by virtue of a cooperation agreement. Reuse of reflow or any amount left-over, allocated to the risk-sharing instrument, should be made possible, under this Regulation, for the same Member State, at its request and within the same risk-sharing instrument, provided that it still meets the eligibility conditions.
(22) The Commission should verify that the information submitted by the requesting Member State is correct and that the Member State request is justified, and should be empowered to adopt, by means of an implementing act, within four months of the Member State request, a decision on the terms and conditions of the participation of the requesting Member State in the risk-sharing instrument. However, only projects for which a favourable financing decision is taken either by the EIB or by the national or international public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, as the case may be, should be accepted as eligible for financing through an established risk-sharing instrument. In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, the Commission decision should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(23) Given the crisis-management purpose and the nature of the risk-sharing instrument introduced by this Regulation, as well as the unprecedented crisis affecting international markets and the economic downturn which have seriously damaged the financial stability of several Member States and which require a rapid response in order to counter the effects on the real economy, the labour market and citizens, it is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(24) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '23.5.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 133/1', 'title': 'REGULATION (EU) No 423/2012 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL\nof 22 May 2012\namending Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as regards certain provisions relating to risk-sharing instruments for Member States experiencing or threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability and provoked a strong deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several Member States.\n\n((2)) Whilst important actions to counterbalance the negative effects of the crisis have already been taken, including amendments to the legislative framework, the impact of the financial crisis on the real economy, the labour market and citizens, is being widely felt.\n\n((3)) Pursuant to Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which provides for the possibility of granting Union financial assistance to a Member State in difficulties or seriously threatened with severe difficulties caused, inter alia, by exceptional occurrences beyond its control, Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010(3)established a European financial stabilisation mechanism with a view to preserving the financial stability of the Union.\n\n((4)) By Council Implementing Decisions 2011/77/EU(4)and 2011/344/EU(5), Ireland and Portugal, respectively, were granted financial assistance under Regulation (EU) No 407/2010.\n\n((5)) Greece was already experiencing serious difficulties with respect to its financial stability before the entry into force of Regulation (EU) No 407/2010.

The Intercreditor Agreement is to remain in full force and effect for a three-year programme period, as long as there are any amounts outstanding under the Loan Facility Agreement.\n\n((7)) Council Regulation (EC) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002 establishing a facility providing medium-term financial assistance for Member States’ balances of payments(6)provides that the Council is to grant mutual assistance where a Member State which has not adopted the euro is in difficulties or is seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments.\n\n((8)) By Council Decisions 2009/102/EC(7)and 2009/459/EC(8), Hungary and Romania, respectively, were granted financial assistance under Regulation (EC) No 332/2002.\n\n((9)) On 11 July 2011, finance ministers of the 17 euro area Member States signed the Treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Following decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area on 21 July and 9 December 2011, the Treaty was modified in order to improve the effectiveness of the mechanism and signed on 2 February 2012. Under that Treaty, the ESM will, by 2013, assume the tasks currently fulfilled by the European Financial Stability Facility and the European financial stabilisation mechanism. The ESM should, therefore, be taken into account by this Regulation.\n\n((10)) In its conclusions of 23 and 24 June 2011, the European Council welcomed the Commission’s intention to enhance the synergies between the loan programme for Greece and the Union funds, and supported efforts to increase Greece’s capacity to absorb Union funds in order to stimulate growth and employment by refocusing on improving competitiveness and employment creation. Moreover, it welcomed and supported the preparation by the Commission, together with the Member States, of a comprehensive programme of technical assistance to Greece.\n\n((11)) In the Statement by the Heads of State or Government of the euro area and the EU institutions of 21 July 2011, the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) were invited to enhance the synergies between loan programmes and Union funds in all countries under Union or International Monetary Fund assistance. This Regulation should contribute to that objective.\n\n((12)) In the Statement of the Members of the European Council of 30 January 2012, the Heads of State or Government agreed on strengthening EIB support for infrastructure as an urgent measure and invited the Council, the Commission and the EIB to consider possible options to enhance EIB action to support growth and to make appropriate recommendations, including possibilities for the general budget of the European Union to leverage EIB group financing capacity. This Regulation aims to respond to that invitation in the current crisis-management context.\n\n((13)) The implementation of operational programmes and projects in the field of infrastructure and productive investment in Greece faces serious problems because the conditions for the participation of the private sector and particularly of the financial sector have changed dramatically as a result of the economic and financial crisis.\n\n((14)) In order to alleviate those problems and to speed up the implementation of operational programmes and projects, as well as to strengthen the economic recovery, it is necessary that the Member States, which have experienced or have been threatened with serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability and which have been granted financial assistance under one of the financial assistance mechanisms set out in Article 77(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund(9)as amended by Regulation (EU) No 1311/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council(10), may contribute financial resources from operational programmes to the establishment of risk-sharing instruments providing loans or guarantees or other financial facilities, in support of projects and operations provided for under an operational programme.\n\n((15)) In light of the EIB’s long-standing expertise as a major financier of infrastructure projects and its commitment to support economic recovery, the Commission should be able to establish risk-sharing instruments by means of a cooperation agreement concluded with the EIB for such a purpose. In order to provide legal certainty, it is necessary to set out the typical main terms and conditions of such a cooperation agreement in Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. As regards the specific crisis-management nature of risk-sharing instruments, as provided for under this Regulation, the specific terms and conditions of each cooperation should be laid down in an individual cooperation agreement, to be concluded between the Commission and the EIB in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities(11).\n\n((16)) In view of the need to expand investment opportunities which may arise in the Member States concerned, the Commission should also be able to establish risk-sharing instruments with national or international public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public-service mission providing adequate guarantees, as referred to in Article 54(2)(c) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, under similar terms and conditions to those applied to and by the EIB.\n\n((17)) To respond rapidly in the context of the current economic, financial and social crisis, risk-sharing instruments under this Regulation should be implemented by the Commission in accordance with Article 54(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.\n\n((18)) In the interests of clarity and legal certainty, a definition of a risk-sharing instrument should be inserted in Article 36a of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 as amended by this Regulation. Risk-sharing instruments should be used for loans and guarantees as well as for other financial facilities in order to finance operations, co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) or the Cohesion Fund (CF), as regards investment costs which cannot be financed, as eligible expenditure pursuant to Article 55 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, or pursuant to the Union rules on State aids. For this purpose, it is also necessary to establish a derogation from Article 54(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.\n\n((19)) A Member State seeking to benefit from a risk-sharing instrument should clearly specify, in its written request to the Commission, why it considers that it meets one of the eligibility conditions of Article 77(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 and it should attach to its request all the information required under this Regulation in order to prove the specified eligibility condition. In its request, the requesting Member State should also identify the programmes (including the list of project proposals and related funding needs) co-financed by the ERDF or the CF and the part of the 2012 and 2013 allocations to such programmes that it wants to allocate to the risk-sharing instrument. The Member State request should, therefore, be transmitted to the Commission, by 31 August 2013, with a view to the adoption of a Commission decision on the participation of the requesting Member State in a risk-sharing instrument by 31 December 2013. Before the Commission decision on the Member State request, the related operational programmes under the ERDF and the CF should be revised, in accordance with Article 33(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006.\n\n((20)) Selected operations, eligible under a risk-sharing instrument, should be either major projects that have already been subject to a Commission decision under Article 41 of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 or other projects, co-financed by the ERDF or the CF and falling under one or more of their operational programmes, where these projects face a lack of finance regarding the investment costs to be borne by private investors. Finally, selected operations could also be operations which contribute to the objectives of the national strategic reference framework of the requesting Member State and of the Community strategic guidelines on cohesion and which can, by virtue of their character, contribute to supporting growth, and strengthen the economic recovery, subject to availability of funds under the risk-sharing instrument.\n\n((21)) In addition, the requesting Member State should specify in its request the amount available for its exclusive benefit, within its cohesion policy financial allocation pursuant to Article 18(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and which can be earmarked for the objectives of the risk-sharing instrument exclusively from the Union budget commitments to be effected in the years 2012 and 2013, pursuant to Article 75(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006, and which should not exceed 10\xa0% of the indicative total allocation for the requesting Member State for the years 2007-13 regarding the ERDF and the CF, and approved in accordance with Article 28(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. Finally, it is necessary to ensure that Union financing of the risk-sharing instrument, including management fees and other eligible costs, is clearly limited to the above-specified maximum amount of the Union contribution to the risk-sharing instrument and there should be no additional contingent liability for the general budget of the European Union. Any residual risk inherent in the financed operations under the established risk-sharing instrument should, therefore, be borne either by the EIB or by the national or international public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, with which the risk-sharing instrument has been established by virtue of a cooperation agreement. Reuse of reflow or any amount left-over, allocated to the risk-sharing instrument, should be made possible, under this Regulation, for the same Member State, at its request and within the same risk-sharing instrument, provided that it still meets the eligibility conditions.\n\n((22)) The Commission should verify that the information submitted by the requesting Member State is correct and that the Member State request is justified, and should be empowered to adopt, by means of an implementing act, within four months of the Member State request, a decision on the terms and conditions of the participation of the requesting Member State in the risk-sharing instrument. However, only projects for which a favourable financing decision is taken either by the EIB or by the national or international public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission, as the case may be, should be accepted as eligible for financing through an established risk-sharing instrument. In the interests of transparency and legal certainty, the Commission decision should be published in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n\n((23)) Given the crisis-management purpose and the nature of the risk-sharing instrument introduced by this Regulation, as well as the unprecedented crisis affecting international markets and the economic downturn which have seriously damaged the financial stability of several Member States and which require a rapid response in order to counter the effects on the real economy, the labour market and citizens, it is appropriate that this Regulation enters into force on the day of its publication in theOfficial Journal of the European Union.\n\n((24)) Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Risk-sharing instrument', 'text': 'Article 1\nRegulation (EC) No 1083/2006 is hereby amended as follows:\n(1)\nin Article 14, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:\n‘1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The budget of the European Union allocated to the Funds shall be implemented within the framework of shared management between the Member States and the Commission, in accordance with point (b) of Article 53 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities\n(\n*1\n)\n, with the exception of the instrument referred to in Article 36a of this Regulation and of the technical assistance referred to in Article 45 of this Regulation.\nThe principle of sound financial management shall be applied in accordance with Article 48(2) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002.\n(\n*1\n)\nOJ L 248, 16.9.2002, p. 1\n.’;""\n(2)\nthe following article is inserted:\n‘Article 36a\nRisk-sharing instrument\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0For the purpose of this Article, a risk-sharing instrument means a financial instrument which guarantees the total or partial coverage of a defined risk, where appropriate in exchange for an agreed remuneration.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0A Member State that meets one of the conditions set out in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 77(2), may contribute a part of the overall resources distributed in accordance with Articles 19 and 20 to a risk-sharing instrument which shall be established by means of a cooperation agreement to be concluded by the Commission either with the EIB or with national or international public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission providing adequate guarantees as referred to in Article 54(2)(c) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002, under similar terms and conditions to those applied to and by the EIB (“contracted implementing body”), to cover the provisioning and capital allocation of guarantees and loans, as well as other financial facilities, granted under the risk-sharing instrument.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The cooperation agreement, referred to in paragraph 2, shall contain rules in particular on: the total amount of the Union contribution and a schedule on how it will be made available;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC(1), and in particular the second sentence of Article 10 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) With regard to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) for any purpose other than placing on the market, Article 10 of Directive 2001/18/EC requires the notifier of such a release, to send the competent authority, after completion of a release, and thereafter, at any intervals laid down in the consent on the basis of the results of the environmental risk assessment, the results of the release in terms of any risk to human health or the environment, with, where appropriate, particular reference to any kind of product that the notifier intends to notify at a later stage.
(2) To date, most GMOs deliberately released in the Community pursuant to Part B of Directive 2001/18/EC are genetically modified higher plants (GMHP). It is necessary, therefore, with regard to those plants, to establish the format to be used by the notifier when presenting the results of the release to the competent authority. That format should reflect the need to enable the fullest possible exchange of relevant information, presented in a standardised and easily comprehensible manner. The format should be kept as general as possible so that, where appropriate, multi-sites, multi-annual releases or releases of several GMOs can be covered by a single report.
(3) Since genetic engineering is not restricted to higher plants, it will be necessary to establish formats for other types of GMOs, such as genetically modified (GM) animals (including GM insects), veterinary and medicinal products (containing or consisting of GMOs) or GM plants which could produce pharmaceutical products. Future developments may also make it necessary to adapt the report formats which have already been established.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 337/79 of 5 February 1979 on the common organization of the market in wine (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1208/84 (2),
Having regard to Council Regulation No 129 of 23 October 1962 on the value of the unit of account and the exchange rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2543/73 (4), and in particular Article 3 thereof,

Having regard to the opinion of the Monetary Committee,

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 4 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease of poultry and other captive birds with a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming causing disturbance to trade within the Union and export to third countries.
(2) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent spreads to other poultry holdings within that Member State, but also to other Member States and to third countries through trade in live poultry or their products.
(3) Council Directive 2005/94/EC (2) introducing Community measures for the control of avian influenza sets out measures which in the event of an outbreak have to be immediately implemented by Member States as a matter of urgency to prevent further spread of the virus.
(4) Decision 2009/470/EC lays down the procedures governing the financial contribution from the Union towards specific veterinary measures, including emergency measures. Pursuant to Article 4(2) of that Decision, Member States shall obtain a financial contribution towards the costs of certain measures to eradicate avian influenza.
(5) Article 4(3) first and second indents of Decision 2009/470/EC lays down rules on the percentage of the costs incurred by the Member State that may be covered by the financial contribution from the Union.
(6) The payment of a financial contribution from the Union towards emergency measures to eradicate avian influenza is subject to the rules laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 349/2005 of 28 February 2005 laying down rules on the Community financing of emergency measures and of the campaign to combat certain animal diseases under Council Decision 90/424/EEC (3).
(7) Outbreaks of avian influenza occurred in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands in 2011. Germany, Italy and the Netherlands took measures in accordance with Directive 2005/94/EC to combat those outbreaks.
(8) The authorities of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands were able to demonstrate through reports provided in the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and continuous submission of information on the development of the disease situation that they have efficiently implemented the control measures provided for in Directive 2005/94/EC.
(9) The authorities of Germany, Italy and the Netherlands have therefore fulfilled their technical and administrative obligations with regard to the measures provided for in Article 4(2) of Decision 2009/470/EC and Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 349/2005.
(10) At this stage, the exact amount of the financial contribution from the Union cannot be determined as the information on the cost of compensation and on operational expenditure provided are estimates.

(2011/167/EU)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 329(1) thereof,
Having regard to the requests made by the Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, Ireland, the Hellenic Republic, the French Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Hungary, Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union shall establish an internal market, shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and shall promote scientific and technological advance. The creation of the legal conditions enabling undertakings to adapt their activities in manufacturing and distributing products across national borders and providing companies with more choice and opportunities contributes to attaining this objective. A unitary patent which provides uniform effects throughout the Union should feature amongst the legal instruments which undertakings have at their disposal.
(2) Pursuant to Article 118 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and in the context of the establishment and functioning of the internal market, measures should include the creation of uniform patent protection throughout the Union and the establishment of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements.
(3) On 5 July 2000, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the Community patent for the creation of a unitary patent providing uniform protection throughout the Union. On 30 June 2010, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the European Union patent (hereinafter ‘the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements’) providing for the translation arrangements applicable to the European Union patent.
(4) At the Council meeting on 10 November 2010, it was recorded that there was no unanimity to go ahead with the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements. It was confirmed on 10 December 2010 that insurmountable difficulties existed, making unanimity impossible at the time and in the foreseeable future. Since the agreement on the proposed Regulation on the translation arrangements is necessary for a final agreement on unitary patent protection in the Union, it is established that the objective to create unitary patent protection for the Union could not be attained within a reasonable period by applying the relevant provisions of the Treaties.
(5) In these circumstances, 12 Member States, namely Denmark, Germany, Estonia, France, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom, addressed requests to the Commission by letters dated 7, 8 and 13 December 2010 indicating that they wished to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection on the basis of the existing proposals supported by these Member States during the negotiations and that the Commission should submit a proposal to the Council to that end. The requests were confirmed at the meeting of the Council on 10 December 2010. In the meantime, 13 more Member States, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Malta, Austria, Portugal, Romania and Slovakia have written to the Commission indicating that they also wish to participate in the envisaged enhanced cooperation. In total, 25 Member States have requested enhanced cooperation.
(6) Enhanced cooperation should provide the necessary legal framework for the creation of unitary patent protection in participating Member States and ensure the possibility for undertakings throughout the Union to improve their competitiveness by having the choice of seeking uniform patent protection in participating Member States, as well as contributing to scientific and technological advance.
(7) Enhanced cooperation should aim at creating a unitary patent, providing uniform protection throughout the territories of the participating Member States, which would be granted in respect of all those Member States by the European Patent Office (EPO). As a necessary part of the unitary patent, the applicable translation arrangements should be simple and cost-effective and correspond to those provided for in the proposal for a Council Regulation on the translation arrangements for the European Union patent, presented by the Commission on 30 June 2010, combined with the elements of compromise proposed by the Presidency in November 2010 that had wide support in Council. The translation arrangements would maintain the possibility of filing patent applications in any language of the Union at the EPO, and would ensure compensation of the costs related to the translation of applications filed in languages other than an official language of the EPO. The patent having unitary effect should be granted only in one of the official languages of the EPO as provided for in the Convention on the Grant of European Patents (European Patent Convention). No further translations would be required without prejudice to transitional arrangements which would be proportionate and require additional translations on a temporary basis, without legal effect and purely for information purposes. In any case, transitional arrangements would terminate when high quality machine translations are made available, subject to an objective evaluation of their quality. In case of a dispute, mandatory translation obligations should apply to the patent proprietor.
(8) The conditions laid down in Article 20 TEU and in Articles 326 and 329 TFEU are fulfilled.
(9) The area within which enhanced cooperation would take place, the establishment of measures for the creation of a unitary patent providing protection throughout the Union and the setting-up of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements, is identified by Article 118 TFEU as one of the areas covered by the Treaties.
(10) It was recorded at the Council meeting on 10 November 2010 and confirmed on 10 December 2010 that the objective to establish unitary patent protection within the Union cannot be attained within a reasonable period by the Union as a whole, thus fulfilling the requirement in Article 20(2) TEU that enhanced cooperation be adopted only as a last resort.
(11) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection aims at fostering scientific and technological advance and the functioning of the internal market. The creation of unitary patent protection for a group of Member States would improve the level of patent protection by providing the possibility to obtain uniform patent protection throughout the territories of the participating Member States and eliminate the costs and complexity for those territories. Thus, it furthers the objectives of the Union, protects its interests and reinforces its integration process in accordance with Article 20(1) TEU.
(12) The creation of unitary patent protection is not included in the list of areas of exclusive competence of the Union set out in Article 3(1) TFEU. The legal basis for the creation of European intellectual property rights is Article 118 TFEU, which falls within Chapter 3 (Approximation of Laws) of Title VII (Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws), and makes a specific reference to the establishment and functioning of the internal market, which is one of the shared competences of the Union according to Article 4 TFEU. The creation of unitary patent protection, including applicable translation arrangements, therefore falls within the framework of the Union’s non-exclusive competence.
(13) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection complies with the Treaties and Union law, and does not undermine the internal market or economic, social or territorial cohesion. It does not constitute a barrier to, or discrimination in, trade between Member States and does not distort competition between them.
(14) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection respects the competences, rights and obligations of non-participating Member States. The possibility of obtaining unitary patent protection on the territories of the Member States participating does not affect the availability or the conditions of patent protection on the territories of non-participating Member States. Moreover, undertakings from non-participating Member States should have the possibility to obtain unitary patent protection on the territories of the participating Member States under the same conditions as undertakings from participating Member States. Existing rules of non-participating Member States determining the conditions of obtaining patent protection on their territory remain unaffected.
(15) In particular, enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection would comply with Union law on patents since enhanced cooperation would respect pre-existing acquis.
(16) Subject to compliance with any conditions of participation laid down in this Decision, enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection is open at any time to all Member States willing to comply with the acts already adopted within this framework in accordance with Article 328 TFEU,","{'header': '22.3.2011 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 76/53', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 10 March 2011\nauthorising enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection\n(2011/167/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In accordance with Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the Union shall establish an internal market, shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth and shall promote scientific and technological advance.

In case of a dispute, mandatory translation obligations should apply to the patent proprietor.\n\n((8)) The conditions laid down in Article 20 TEU and in Articles 326 and 329 TFEU are fulfilled.\n\n((9)) The area within which enhanced cooperation would take place, the establishment of measures for the creation of a unitary patent providing protection throughout the Union and the setting-up of centralised Union-wide authorisation, coordination and supervision arrangements, is identified by Article 118 TFEU as one of the areas covered by the Treaties.\n\n((10)) It was recorded at the Council meeting on 10 November 2010 and confirmed on 10 December 2010 that the objective to establish unitary patent protection within the Union cannot be attained within a reasonable period by the Union as a whole, thus fulfilling the requirement in Article 20(2) TEU that enhanced cooperation be adopted only as a last resort.\n\n((11)) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection aims at fostering scientific and technological advance and the functioning of the internal market. The creation of unitary patent protection for a group of Member States would improve the level of patent protection by providing the possibility to obtain uniform patent protection throughout the territories of the participating Member States and eliminate the costs and complexity for those territories. Thus, it furthers the objectives of the Union, protects its interests and reinforces its integration process in accordance with Article 20(1) TEU.\n\n((12)) The creation of unitary patent protection is not included in the list of areas of exclusive competence of the Union set out in Article 3(1) TFEU. The legal basis for the creation of European intellectual property rights is Article 118 TFEU, which falls within Chapter 3 (Approximation of Laws) of Title VII (Common Rules on Competition, Taxation and Approximation of Laws), and makes a specific reference to the establishment and functioning of the internal market, which is one of the shared competences of the Union according to Article 4 TFEU. The creation of unitary patent protection, including applicable translation arrangements, therefore falls within the framework of the Union’s non-exclusive competence.\n\n((13)) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection complies with the Treaties and Union law, and does not undermine the internal market or economic, social or territorial cohesion. It does not constitute a barrier to, or discrimination in, trade between Member States and does not distort competition between them.\n\n((14)) Enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection respects the competences, rights and obligations of non-participating Member States. The possibility of obtaining unitary patent protection on the territories of the Member States participating does not affect the availability or the conditions of patent protection on the territories of non-participating Member States. Moreover, undertakings from non-participating Member States should have the possibility to obtain unitary patent protection on the territories of the participating Member States under the same conditions as undertakings from participating Member States. Existing rules of non-participating Member States determining the conditions of obtaining patent protection on their territory remain unaffected.\n\n((15)) In particular, enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection would comply with Union law on patents since enhanced cooperation would respect pre-existingacquis.\n\n((16)) Subject to compliance with any conditions of participation laid down in this Decision, enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection is open at any time to all Member States willing to comply with the acts already adopted within this framework in accordance with Article 328 TFEU,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe Kingdom of Belgium, the Republic of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, Ireland, the Hellenic Republic, the French Republic, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Republic of Hungary, Malta, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, Romania, the Republic of Slovenia, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland are hereby authorised to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, by applying the relevant provisions of the Treaties.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nThis Decision shall enter into force on the day of its adoption.'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority of a Member State, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.
(2) A notification concerning the placing on the market of two genetically modified maize products (Zea mays L., line MON 863 and hybrid MON 863 × MON 810) was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of Germany.
(3) The notification covers importation and use as for any other maize grains including feed but not food use, with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of varieties derived from the MON 863 transformation event as well as with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of MON 863 × MON 810 hybrids.
(4) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of Germany prepared an assessment report, which was submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States. That assessment report concludes that no reasons have emerged on the basis of which consent for the placing on the market of MON 863 maize as well as MON 863 × MON 810 maize should be withheld, if specific conditions are fulfilled.
(5) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.
(6) The opinion adopted on 2 April 2004 by the European Food Safety Authority, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (2), concluded, from all evidence provided, that Zea mays L. line MON 863 is unlikely to have an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment in the context of its proposed use. The European Food Safety Authority also found that the scope of the monitoring plan provided by the consent holder is in line with the intended uses of MON 863.
(7) Concerning the hybrid MON 863 × MON 810, the European Food Safety Authority considered that it is scientifically valid to use the data from the single lines MON 863 and MON 810 to support the safety assessment of the hybrid MON 863 × MON 810, but decided regarding the need for confirmatory data for the safety assessment of the hybrid itself, to request a 90-day sub-chronic rat study with the maize hybrid in order to complete its safety assessment. Thus, only the safety assessment of the maize line MON 863 has been finalised.
(8) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of Zea mays L. line MON 863 will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.
(9) A unique identifier should be assigned to the MON 863 maize for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC (3) and Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(10) Adventitious or technically unavoidable traces of genetically modified organisms in products are exempted from labelling and traceability requirements in accordance with thresholds established under Directive 2001/18/EC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (5).
(11) In light of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, it is not necessary to establish specific conditions for the intended uses with regard to the handling or packaging of the product and the protection of particular ecosystems, environments or geographical areas.
(12) Prior to the placing on the market of the product, the necessary measures to ensure its labelling and traceability at all stages of its placing on the market, including verification by appropriate validated detection methodology, should be applicable.
(13) The measures provided for in this Decision are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee established under Article 30 of Directive 2001/18/EC and the Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures. Since on the expiry of the period laid down in Article 30(2) of Directive 2001/18/EC the Council had neither adopted the proposed measures nor indicated its opposition to them in accordance with Article 5(6) of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (6) the measures should be adopted by the Commission,","{'header': '10.8.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 207/17', 'title': 'COMMISSION DECISION\nof 8 August 2005\nconcerning the placing on the market, in accordance with Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of a maize product (Zea maysL., line MON 863) genetically modified for resistance to corn rootworm\n(notified under document number C(2005) 2950)\n(Only the German text is authentic)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2005/608/EC)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority of a Member State, in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.\n\n((2)) A notification concerning the placing on the market of two genetically modified maize products (Zea maysL., line MON 863 and hybrid MON 863\xa0×\xa0MON 810) was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of Germany.\n\n((3)) The notification covers importation and use as for any other maize grains including feed but not food use, with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of varieties derived from the MON 863 transformation event as well as with the exception of the cultivation in the Community of MON 863\xa0×\xa0MON 810 hybrids.\n\n((4)) In accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 14 of Directive 2001/18/EC, the competent authority of Germany prepared an assessment report, which was submitted to the Commission and the competent authorities of the other Member States.

Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, records for refrigeration, air conditioning and heat pump equipment shall contain certain information. In order to ensure the effective implementation of Regulation (EC) No 842/2006, it is appropriate to provide for further information to be indicated in the equipment records.
(2) Information on the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge should be included in the equipment records. Where the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge is unknown, the operator of the equipment concerned should ensure that certified personnel determine that charge in order to facilitate the leakage checking.
(3) Before the leakage check is carried out, certified personnel should carefully go through the information contained in the equipment records to determine any previous issues and consult previous reports.
(4) In order to ensure an efficient leakage control, the leakage checks should focus on those parts of the equipment which are most likely to leak.
(5) Leakage checks should be carried out using direct or indirect measuring methods. Direct measuring methods identify leakage by the use of detection devices which can determine whether the fluorinated greenhouse gas charge is escaping from the system. Indirect measuring methods are based on the identification of abnormal performance in the system and on the analysis of relevant parameters.
(6) Indirect measuring methods should be applied in cases where the leakage develops very slowly and where the equipment is placed in a well ventilated environment making it difficult to detect fluorinated greenhouse gases escaping from the system in the air. Direct measuring methods are necessary to identify the exact location of the leakage. The decision on the measuring method to be used should be taken by certified personnel who have the necessary training and experience to determine the most appropriate measuring method on a case by case basis.
(7) Where there is a presumption of a leakage it should be followed up by a check to identify and to repair it.
(8) In order to ensure the safety of the system repaired, the follow-up check provided for in Regulation (EC) No 842/2006 should focus on the parts of the system where leakage has been detected and on the adjacent parts.
(9) Defective installation of new systems constitutes a significant risk of leakage. Therefore, newly installed systems should be checked for leakage immediately after they have been put into service.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Greece, and in particular Protocol 4 on cotton, as last amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1553/95(1),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 of 2 July 1987 adjusting the system of aid for cotton introduced by Protocol 4 annexed to the Act of Accession of Greece(2), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1553/95, and in particular Article 2(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1554/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down the general rules for the system of aid for cotton and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2169/81(3), as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1419/98(4), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1554/95 provides that actual production in each marketing year is to be determined before the end of June of that year, account being taken in particular of the quantities for which aid has been requested. Application of that criterion results in actual production in respect of the 1999/2000 marketing year being set at the level set out below.
(2) Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1964/87 stipulates that, if actual production in Spain and Greece exceeds the maximum guaranteed quantity, the guide price referred to in paragraph 8 of Protocol 4 is to be reduced in each Member State where production exceeds its guaranteed national quantity (GNQ). Such reduction is calculated differently depending on whether the GNQ is exceeded both in Greece and Spain or only in one of those Member States. In the case under consideration there has been an overrun both in Greece and Spain, therefore. Under Article 6(a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1554/95, the amount by which actual production exceeds the GNQ in each Member State is to be calculated as a percentage of its GNQ and the guide price is to be reduced by a percentage equal to half the percentage excess.

Whereas:
(1) in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
(2) maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues fo the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
(3) in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
(4) for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney. However, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcasses moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
(5) in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
(6) aloe vera gel and whole leaf extract of aloe vera should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;

amending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, concerning the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (1), and in particular Article 13(2) thereof,
Having regard to Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 November 2003 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices, amending Directive 70/156/EEC and repealing Directive 71/127/EEC (2) and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2003/97/EC is one of the separate Directives in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive 70/156/EEC. The provisions of Directive 70/156/EEC relating to systems, components and separate technical units for vehicles therefore apply to Directive 2003/97/EC.
(2) In order to reduce the blind spot of N2 vehicles of mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes, it is necessary to modify certain requirements laid down in Directive 2003/97/EC.
(3) Since 2003, technical progress with regard to rear view mirrors has advanced considerably. It is now possible to install wide-angle rear-view mirrors on some N2 vehicles of mass not exceeding 7,5 tonnes. It is therefore appropriate to amend Directive 2003/97/EC by extending the obligation to fit Class IV wide-angle mirrors to those vehicles of category N2 having a cabin similar to that of N3 vehicles. The appropriate criterion for distinguishing the two types of N2 vehicles should be whether a class V close-proximity mirror can be fitted.
(4) Vehicles having seats with a fixed seat-back angle would not be able to fulfil the standard requirements. A correction factor for such vehicles should therefore be introduced.
(5) It is also appropriate to amend the administrative provisions for type-approval by introducing the distinguishing numbers of the Member States which acceded to the Community on 1 May 2004.
(6) The measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress set up under Article 13(1) of Directive 70/156/EEC,","{'header': '30.3.2005 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 81/44', 'title': 'COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2005/27/EC\nof 29 March 2005\namending, for the purposes of its adaptation to technical progress, Directive 2003/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, concerning the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of devices for indirect vision and of vehicles equipped with these devices\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 2003/97/EC is one of the separate Directives in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive 70/156/EEC.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 18(1) thereof,
After consulting the European Food Safety Authority,
Whereas:
(1) Pursuant to Directive 2001/18/EC, the placing on the market of a product containing or consisting of a genetically modified organism or a combination of genetically modified organisms is subject to written consent being granted by the competent authority of the Member State that received the notification for the placing on the market of that product in accordance with the procedure laid down in that Directive.
(2) A notification concerning the placing on the market of a genetically modified maize product (Zea mays L. line NK603), to be used as any other maize but not for cultivation, was submitted by Monsanto SA to the competent authority of Spain which transmitted it to the Commission and to the competent authorities of other Member States with a positive opinion.
(3) The competent authorities of other Member States raised objections to the placing on the market of the product.
(4) The opinion adopted on 25 November 2003 by the European Food Safety Authority, as established by Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (2), concluded that Zea mays L. line NK603 is as safe as conventional maize and that its placing on the market for food, feed or processing is therefore unlikely to have an adverse effect on human or animal health or, in that context, on the environment.
(5) An examination of each of the objections in the light of Directive 2001/18/EC, of the information submitted in the notification and of the opinion of the European Food Safety Authority, discloses no reason to believe that the placing on the market of Zea mays L. line NK603 will adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.
(6) A unique identifier should be assigned to the product for the purposes of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003.
