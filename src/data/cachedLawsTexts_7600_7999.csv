Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 70/524/EEC of 23 November 1970 concerning additives in feedingstuffs (1), and in particular Articles 3, 9d(1) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.
(2) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) The application for the authorisation of the additive listed in the Annex to this Regulation was submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Those applications are therefore to continue to be treated in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 70/524/EEC.
(5) The use of the enzyme preparation of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8, produced by Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136) was provisionally authorised for the first time for pigs for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 261/2003 (3) and turkeys for fattening by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2188/2002 (4). New data were submitted in support of an application for authorisation without a time limit of that enzyme preparation. The assessment shows that the conditions laid down in Article 3a of Directive 70/524/EEC for such authorisation are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that enzyme preparation, as specified in Annex to this Regulation, should be authorised without a time limit.
(6) The assessment of this application shows that certain procedures should be required to protect workers from exposure to the additives set out in the Annex. Such protection should be assured by the application of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (5).
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '11.5.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 122/22', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 516/2007\nof 10 May 2007\nconcerning the permanent authorisation of an additive in feedingstuffs\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition.\n\n((2)) Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down transitional measures for applications for the authorisation of feed additives submitted in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n\n((3)) The application for the authorisation of the additive listed in the Annex to this Regulation was submitted before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.\n\n((4)) Initial comments on those applications, as provided for in Article 4(4) of Directive 70/524/EEC, were forwarded to the Commission before the date of application of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products(1), and in particular Article 8(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Articles 5(2) and 7(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000(2) provide a system for advance fixing of the rate of refund applicable to goods exported during the validity period of a refund certificate. Where the system of advance fixing is applied, the rate of refund in force on the day on which the application for advance fixing is lodged applies to goods exported at a later date during the validity period of the refund certificate.
(2) However, as the rates of refund for milk, sugar, cereals and rice are liable to be fixed or modified on Thursdays, there would be a risk of applications for advance fixing for those products being lodged for speculative reasons if such applications lodged on a Thursday were deemed to have been submitted on that day. In order to reduce that risk it should therefore be provided that where an application for advance fixing is lodged on a Thursday, the application is deemed to have been submitted on the following working day.
(3) Article 21 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3) provides that no refund is to be granted on products that are not of sound and fair marketable quality on the day of acceptance of the export declaration. In order to ensure that this rule is uniformly applied it should be stipulated in Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 that for a refund to be granted on the products that are indicated in Article 1 of Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products(4), or Article 1 of Council Directive 89/437/EEC of 20 June 1989 on hygiene and health problems affecting the production and the placing on the market of egg products(5), and appear in Annex B to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, they must be prepared in accordance with the requirements of those directives and carry the required health mark.
(4) As some operators may, in practice, require time to make the arrangements necessary to ensure that the packaging on their goods bear the requisite health mark, this requirement should not apply before 15 April 2004.
(5) Therefore, Regulation (EC) 1520/2000 should be amended accordingly.
(6) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee on horizontal questions concerning trade in processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 543/2004 of 24 March 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amounts of such refunds', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EC) No 1520/2000 is amended as follows:\n\n1.

Whereas the Association Agreements between, on the one part, the European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community, and the other part the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Poland and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic were  signed on 16 December 1991; whereas, awaiting the entry into force of these Agreements, the Community decided to apply with effect from 1 March 1992 Intermediate Agreements concluded with the aforesaid countries, hereinafter referred to as 'Intermediate  Agreements';

Whereas, in order to assure efficient management of the regime foreseen, it is appropriate to provide that the guarantee in respect of the import licences within the framework of the said regime should be fixed at ECU 30 per tonne; whereas the risk of  speculation inherent to the regime in question in the pigmeat sector requires that access of operators to the said regime be subordinate to the respect of certain precise conditions;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species(1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/556/EEC of 25 September 1989 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in and importation from third countries of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species(2), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/429/EEC of 26 June 1990 laying down the animal health requirements applicable to intra-Community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species(3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down the animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC(4), and in particular Article 17(3)(a) thereof.
Whereas:
(1) Commission Decision 90/14/EEC of 20 December 1989(5) establishes a list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of deep-frozen semen of domestic animals of the bovine species.
(2) Commission Decision 91/270/EEC of 14 May 1991(6) establishes a list of third countries from which Member States may authorise the importation of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine species.
(3) Commission Decision 92/452/EEC of 30 July 1992(7) establishes lists of embryo collection teams approved in third countries for export of bovine embryos to the Community.
(4) Commission Decision 92/471/EEC of 2 September 1992(8) establishes animal health conditions and veterinary certification for importation of bovine embryos from third countries.
(5) Commission Decision 93/693/EC of 14 December 1993(9) establishes a list of semen collection centres approved for the export to the Community of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species from third countries.
(6) Commission Decision 94/63/EC of 31 January 1994(10) establishes a provisional list of third countries from which Member States may authorize imports of semen, ova and embryos of the ovine, caprine and equine species, ova and embryos of the porcine species.
(7) Commission Decision 94/577/EC of 15 July 1994(11) establishes animal health conditions and veterinary certification for importation of bovine semen from third countries.
(8) Commission Decision 2002/613/EC of 19 July 2002(12) lays down the importation conditions of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species.
(9) Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Malta should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species are authorised under Decision 90/14/EEC in the light of the situation achieved with regard to animal health in those countries.
(10) Therefore, Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of bovine semen are authorised under conditions set out in Decision 94/577/EC.
(11) Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of embryos of domestic animals of the bovine are authorised under Decision 91/270/EEC in the light of the situation achieved with regard to animal health in those countries.
(12) Therefore Cyprus, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta and Slovenia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of bovine embryos are authorised under conditions set out in Decision 92/471/EEC.
(13) The Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Slovakia should be added to the list of third countries from which imports of semen of domestic animals of the porcine species are authorised under Decision 2002/613/EC in the light of the situation achieved with regard to animal health in those countries.
(14) Decisions 90/14/EEC, 91/270/EEC, 92/452/EEC, 92/471/EEC, 94/63/EC, 94/577/EC and 2002/613/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(15) Since Directive 2003/43/EC entered into force, the lists of semen collection and storage centres from which Member States shall authorise the importation of semen of domestic animals of the bovine species originating in third countries are prepared and updated in accordance with Article 9(1) of Directive 88/407/EEC and are made available to the public at the Commission's web-site. Consequently, the lists of approved collection centres included in Decision 93/693/EC are outdated and therefore obsolete.
(16) Decision 93/693/EC should be therefore repealed accordingly.

","Regulation (EC) No 2422/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 6 November 2001
on a Community energy efficiency labelling programme for office equipment
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3),
Whereas:
(1) Office equipment accounts for a significant share of total electricity consumption. The most effective measure for reducing electrical consumption of office equipment is to reduce the standby consumption in accordance with the Council conclusions of May 1999 on standby losses of consumer electronic equipment. The various models available on the Community market have very different levels of consumption in standby mode.
(2) There are, however, other measures for reducing electricity consumption from such equipment, such as switching it off when not needed, without compromising functionality. The Commission should ascertain which measures are appropriate in order also to exploit this energy-saving potential.
(3) It is important to promote measures aimed at the proper functioning of the internal market.
(4) It is desirable to coordinate the national energy labelling initiatives to minimise the adverse impact on industry and trade.
(5) It is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection. This Regulation contributes to a high level of protection for both the environment and the consumer, in aiming at a significant improvement of the energy efficiency of this type of equipment.
(6) Since the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(7) Moreover, Article 174 of the Treaty calls for the protection and improvement of the environment and prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources, these two objectives being among those of the Community policy on the environment. Electricity generation and consumption account for 30 % of man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and some 35 % of primary energy consumption in the Community. These percentages are increasing, and standby losses from electrical equipment account for about 10 % of its consumption.
(8) Furthermore, Council Decision 89/364/EEC of 5 June 1989 on a Community action programme for improving the efficiency of electricity use(4) has as its twin objectives to encourage consumers to favour appliances and equipment with high electrical efficiency and to improve the efficiency of appliances and equipment. Further steps are needed to improve consumer information.
(9) The UNFCCC Protocol agreed in Kyoto on 10 December 1997 calls for a greenhouse gases emission reduction for the Community of 8 % at the latest during the period 2008 to 2012. In order to achieve this objective, stronger measures are required to reduce CO2 emissions within the Community.
(10) Furthermore, Decision No 2179/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 September 1998 on the review of the European Community programme of policy and action in relation to the environment and sustainable development ""Towards sustainability""(5) indicated as a key priority for the integration of environmental requirements in relation to energy the provision of energy efficiency labelling of appliances.
(11) The Council Resolution of 7 December 1998 on energy efficiency in the European Community(6) called for the increased use of labelling of appliances and equipment.
(12) It is desirable to coordinate energy efficiency requirements, labels and test methods wherever appropriate.
(13) Most energy-efficient office equipment is available at little or no extra cost and may therefore in many cases pay for any additional cost through electricity savings within a reasonably short time. Energy-saving and CO2 reduction objectives can therefore be achieved in a cost-effective manner in this area, without disadvantages for consumers or industry.
(14) Office equipment is traded worldwide. The Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy-efficient labelling programmes for office equipment will facilitate international trade and environmental protection for this equipment. This Regulation is aimed at implementing the abovementioned Agreement in the Community.
(15) In order to influence the requirements of the Energy Star label, which is used worldwide, the Community should participate in this labelling scheme and in drawing up the necessary technical specifications. However, regular reviews must be carried out by the Commission to ascertain whether the technical criteria set are ambitious enough and take sufficient account of the Community's concerns.
(16) An effective enforcement system is necessary to ensure that the energy-efficient labelling programme for office equipment is implemented properly, guarantees fair conditions of competition for producers and protects consumer rights.
(17) This Regulation is confined to office equipment products.
(18) Council Directive 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances(7) is not the most appropriate instrument for office equipment. The most cost-effective measure for promoting energy efficiency of office equipment is a voluntary labelling programme.
(19) It is necessary to assign the task of contributing to setting and reviewing the technical specifications to an appropriate body, the European Community Energy Star Board (ECESB), in order to achieve an efficient and neutral implementation of the scheme. The ECESB should be composed of national representatives.
(20) It is necessary to ensure that the energy-efficient labelling programme for office equipment is consistent and coordinated with the priorities of the Community policy and with other Community labelling or quality-certification schemes such as those established by Directive 92/75/EEC and by Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 on a revised Community eco-label award scheme(8).
(21) It is desirable to coordinate the Community Energy Star programme and other voluntary labelling energy schemes for office equipment in the Community, in order to prevent confusion for consumers and potential market distortions.
(22) It is necessary to guarantee transparency in the implementation of the scheme and to ensure consistency with relevant international standards in order to facilitate access to, and participation in, the scheme for manufacturers and exporters from countries outside the Community,","{'title': 'Regulation (EC) No 2422/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on a Community energy efficiency labelling programme for office equipment', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nObjectives\n\nThis Regulation establishes the rules for the Community energy efficiency labelling programme for office equipment (hereinafter the ""Energy Star programme"") as defined in the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the European Community on the coordination of energy efficient labelling programmes for office equipment (hereinafter referred to as ""the Agreement"").

of 21 June 1999
reimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5"" microdisks) originating in Indonesia and produced and sold for export to the Community by PT Betadiskindo Binatama
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community(1) and in particular Article 11(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
A. PREVIOUS PROCEDURE
(1) By Regulation (EC) No 1821/98(2), the Council imposed a definitive anti-dumping duty of 41,1 % on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5"" microdisks), used to record and store encoded digital computer information (hereinafter referred to as the ""product concerned""), falling within CN code ex 8523 20 90 (Taric code 8523 20 90*10 ) and originating in Indonesia.
B. PRESENT PROCEDURE
(2) The Commission subsequently received an application from the Indonesian producer PT Betadiskindo Binatama (hereinafter referred to as ""Betadiskindo"" or ""the company"") for a review of the measures currently in force, namely a request to initiate a ""new exporter"" review of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98, pursuant to Article 11(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Basic Regulation""). Betadiskindo claimed that it was not related to any of the exporters or producers in Indonesia subject to the anti-dumping measures in force with regard to the product concerned. Furthermore, the company claimed that it had not exported the product concerned to the Community during the original period of investigation (1 March 1994 to 28 February 1995) but that it had exported the product concerned to the Community subsequently.
(3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the company, and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with Article 11(4) of the Basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by Regulation (EC) No 2152/98(3), a review of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 with regard to Betadiskindo and commenced its investigation.
The Regulation initiating the review also repealed the anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 with regard to imports of the product concerned, produced and exported to the Community by Betadiskindo, and directed customs authorities, pursuant to Article 14(5) of the Basic Regulation, to take appropriate steps to register such imports.
(4) The product covered by the review was the same product as the one under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1821/98.
(5) The Commission officially advised Betadiskindo and the representatives of the exporting country. Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing. However, no such request was received by the Commission.
On commencing the investigation, the Commission sent a questionnaire to Betadiskindo. However, the reply to the questionnaire contained deficiencies which the company was asked to rectify but failed to do so. Moreover, the Commission was unable to verify the information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation because no verification visit could be arranged, despite the fact that the company had been informed of the tight time limits applicable to the investigation and of the possible consequence of non-cooperation.
C. SCOPE OF REVIEW
(6) As no request for a review of the findings on injury was made, the review was limited to dumping.
D. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(7) As the company's lack of cooperation meant that the Commission was unable to establish whether the company was indeed a newcomer or calculate the level of dumping, findings were made in accordance with Article 18(1) of the Basic Regulation. In the absence of any cooperation, it must be concluded that imports into the Community of certain magnetic disks (3,5"" microdisks) produced and exported by Betadiskindo should be subject to the country-wide duty (41,1 %) imposed by Council Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 and that that rate of duty should therefore be reimposed.
E. RETROACTIVE LEVYING OF THE ANTI-DUMPING DUTY
(8) As the review has resulted in a determination of dumping in respect of Betadiskindo, the anti-dumping duty applicable to this company shall also be levied retroactively from the date of initiation of the review on imports which, pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2152/98, have been subject to registration.
F. DISCLOSURE AND DURATION OF THE MEASURES
(9) Betadiskindo was informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it was intended to propose the application of Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 to its imports into the Community.
(10) This review does not affect the date on which Regulation (EC) No 1821/98 will expire pursuant to Article 11(2) of the Basic Regulation,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1335/1999 of 21 June 1999 reimposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of certain magnetic disks (3,5"" microdisks) originating in Indonesia and produced and sold for export to the Community by PT Betadiskindo Binatama', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

Having regard to Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 of 12 December 1979 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation (EEC) No 1798/75 (3), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
Whereas, by letter dated 11 January 1982, Germany has requested the Commission to invoke the procedure provided for in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79 in order to determine whether or not the apparatus described as 'Perkin Elmer - Gas Chromatograph, model Sigma 2', ordered on 29 August 1979 and to be used for the analysis of polymers and additives for plastic substances and of monomer residues in polymers and for purity determinations, should be considered to be a scientific apparatus and, where the reply is in the affirmative, whether apparatus of equivalent scientific value is currently being manufactured in the Community;

Whereas, pursuant to Annex VII, Part V 1 (a) to Article 133 of the Act of Accession, the Kingdom of Denmark was granted a derogation regarding the application of certain provisions of Council Directive 69/169/EEC of 28 May 1969 on the harmonization of provisions laid down by law, regulation of administrative action relating to exemption from turnover tax and excise duty on imports in international travel (1), amended by Council Directive 72/230/EEC (2) ; whereas this derogation was extended by Directive 76/134/EEC (3) and Directive 77/82/EEC (4) adopted pursuant to the provisions of Annex VII, Part V 1 (c) of the Act of Accession ; whereas, pursuant to Article 9 (2) of the Act of Accession, the option to extend further this derogation on this basis expires on 31 December 1977;
Whereas the Danish Government has asked that it be granted a further period in which to apply the harmonized rules stemming from Directive 69/169/EEC;
Whereas progress in the attainment of economic and monetary union and, in particular, in fiscal harmonization does not yet allow the full application of such rules in Denmark without the risk of serious economic consequences;
Whereas, therefore, the Kingdom of Denmark should be authorized to maintain provisionally the exceptional arrangements which it has enjoyed hitherto ; whereas, however, in order to facilitate adaptation, provision should be made over a five-year period, for the gradual approximation of these arrangements to the harmonized Community rules,","{'title': 'Council Directive 77/800/EEC of 19 December 1977 on a derogation accorded to the Kingdom of Denmark relating to the rules governing turnover tax and excise duty applicable in international travel', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nBy way of derogation from Directive 69/169/EEC, the Kingdom of Denmark shall have the right, in respect of exemption for imports of tobacco products, alcoholic beverages (distilled beverages and spirits of an alcoholic strength exceeding 22º) and beer (if the quantity exceeds two litres):    (a) to maintain the rules currently in force up to and including 31 December 1979, where such goods are imported by travellers who are not resident in Denmark and whose stay in Denmark is for less than 24 hours;\n\n(b) to apply the following quantitative limits, where such goods are imported by travellers resident in Denmark, after a stay in another country:   - until 31 December 1980, when the stay is less than 72 hours, and from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1982, when the stay is less than 48 hours: >PIC FILE= ""T9001020"">  (1)OJ No L 133, 4.6.1969, p. 6.

Participation\n\nThe Participants to the Sector Understanding are: Australia, the European Community (which includes the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom), Japan, Korea, Norway, Poland and the Slovak Republic.\n\n2. Scope of application\n\nThis Sector Understanding, which complements the Arrangement, sets out specific guidelines for officially supported export credits relating to export contracts of:\n\n2.1. Any new sea-going vessel of 100 gt and above used for the transportation of goods or persons, or for the performance of a specialised service (for example, fishing vessels, fish factory ships, ice breakers and as dredgers, that present in a permanent way by their means of propulsion and direction (steering) all the characteristics of self-navigability in the high sea), tugs of 365 kW and over and to unfinished shells of ships that are afloat and mobile. The Sector Understanding does not cover military vessels. Floating docks and mobile offshore units are not covered by the Sector Understanding, but should problems arise in connection with export credits for such structures, the Participants to the Sector Understanding (hereinafter the Participants), after consideration of substantiated requests by any Participant, may decide that they shall be covered.\n\n2.2. Any conversion of a ship. Ship conversion means any conversion of sea-going vessels of more than 1000 gt on condition that conversion operations entail radical alterations to the cargo plan, the hull or the propulsion system.\n\n2.3. (i) Although hovercraft-type vessels are not included in the Sector Understanding, Participants are allowed to grant export credits for hovercraft vessels on equivalent conditions to those prevailing in the Sector Understanding. They commit themselves to apply this possibility moderately and not to grant such credit conditions to hovercraft vessels in cases where it is established that no competition is offered under the conditions of the Sector Understanding.\n\n(ii) In the Sector Understanding, the term ""hovercraft"" is defined as follows: an amphibious vehicle of at least 100 tons designed to be supported wholly by air expelled from the vehicle forming a plenum contained within a flexible skirt around the periphery of the vehicle and the ground or water surface beneath the vehicle, and capable of being propelled and controlled by aircrews or ducted air from fans or similar devices.\n\n(iii) It is understood that the granting of export credits at conditions equivalent to those prevailing in this Sector Understanding should be limited to those hovercraft vessels used on maritime routes and non-land routes, except for reaching terminal facilities standing at a maximum distance of one kilometre from the water.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPROVISIONS FOR EXPORT CREDITS AND TIED AID\n\n3. Maximum repayment term\n\nThe maximum repayment term, irrespective of country classification, is 12 years after delivery.\n\n4. Cash payments\n\nThe Participants shall require a minimum cash payment of 20 % of the contract price by delivery.\n\n5. Repayment of principal\n\nThe principal sum of an export credit shall be repaid in equal instalments at regular intervals of normally six months and a maximum of 12 months.\n\n6. Minimum premium\n\nThe provisions of the Arrangement in relation to minimum premium benchmarks shall not be applied until such provisions have been further reviewed by the Participants to this Sector Understanding.\n\n7. Aid\n\nAny Participant desiring to provide aid must, in addition to the provisions of the Arrangement, confirm that the ship is not operated under an open registry during the repayment term and that appropriate assurance has been obtained that the ultimate owner resides in the receiving country, is not a non-operational subsidiary of a foreign interest and has undertaken not to sell the ship without his government\'s approval.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPROCEDURES\n\n8. Notification\n\nFor the purpose of transparency each Participant shall, in addition to the provisions of the Arrangement and the IBRD/Berne Union/OECD Creditor Reporting System, provide annually information on its system for the provision of official support and of the means of implementation of this Sector Understanding, including the schemes in force.\n\n9. Review\n\n(a) The Sector Understanding shall be reviewed annually or upon request by any Participant within the context of the OECD Working Party on Shipbuilding, and a report made to the Participants to the Arrangement.\n\n(b) To facilitate coherence and consistency between the Arrangement and this Sector Understanding and taking into account the nature of the shipbuilding industry, the Participants to this Sector Understanding and to the Arrangement will consult and coordinate as appropriate.\n\n(c) Upon a decision by the Participants to the Arrangement to change the Arrangement, the Participants to this Sector Understanding (the Participants) will examine such a decision and consider its relevance to this Sector Understanding. Pending such consideration the amendments to the Arrangement will not apply to this Sector Understanding. In case the Participants can accept the amendments to the Arrangement they shall report this in writing to the Participants to the Arrangement. In case the Participants cannot accept the amendments to the Arrangement as far as their application to shipbuilding is concerned they shall inform the Participants to the Arrangement of their objections and enter into consultations with them with a view to seeking a resolution of the issues. In case no agreement can be reached between the two groups, the views of the Participants as regards the application of the amendments to shipbuilding shall prevail.\n\n(d) Upon entry into force of the ""Agreement Respecting Normal Competitive Conditions in the Commercial Shipbuilding and Repair Industry"" this Sector Understanding shall cease to apply for those Participants who are legally required to apply the 1994 Understanding on Export Credits for Ships (C/WP6(94)6). Such Participants shall work for an immediate review to bring the 1994 Understanding in accordance with this Sector Understanding.\n\nAttachment\n\nCOMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE WORK\n\nIn addition to the future work of the Arrangement, the Participants to this Sector Understanding agree:\n\n(a) to develop an illustrative list of types of ships which are generally considered non-commercially viable, taking into account the disciplines on tied aid set out in the Arrangement;\n\n(b) to review the provisions of the Arrangement in relation to minimum premium benchmarks with a view to incorporating them into this Sector Understanding;\n\n(c) to discuss, subject to the developments in relevant international negotiations, the inclusion of other disciplines on minimum interest rates including a special CIRR and floating rates;\n\n(d) to discuss the applicability of yearly instalments of repayment of principal.""'}]}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 of 23 June 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for imports of molasses in the sugar sector and amending Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(2), and in particular Article 1(2) and Article 3(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1422/95 stipulates that the cif import price for molasses, hereinafter referred to as the ""representative price"", should be set in accordance with Commission Regulation (EEC) No 785/68(3). That price should be fixed for the standard quality defined in Article 1 of the above Regulation.
(2) The representative price for molasses is calculated at the frontier crossing point into the Community, in this case Amsterdam; that price must be based on the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market established on the basis of the quotations or prices on that market adjusted for any deviations from the standard quality. The standard quality for molasses is defined in Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(3) When the most favourable purchasing opportunities on the world market are being established, account must be taken of all available information on offers on the world market, on the prices recorded on important third-country markets and on sales concluded in international trade of which the Commission is aware, either directly or through the Member States. Under Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68, the Commission may for this purpose take an average of several prices as a basis, provided that this average is representative of actual market trends.
(4) The information must be disregarded if the goods concerned are not of sound and fair marketable quality or if the price quoted in the offer relates only to a small quantity that is not representative of the market. Offer prices which can be regarded as not representative of actual market trends must also be disregarded.
(5) If information on molasses of the standard quality is to be comparable, prices must, depending on the quality of the molasses offered, be increased or reduced in the light of the results achieved by applying Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 785/68.
(6) A representative price may be left unchanged by way of exception for a limited period if the offer price which served as a basis for the previous calculation of the representative price is not available to the Commission and if the offer prices which are available and which appear not to be sufficiently representative of actual market trends would entail sudden and considerable changes in the representative price.
(7) Where there is a difference between the trigger price for the product in question and the representative price, additional import duties should be fixed under the conditions set out in Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95. Should the import duties be suspended pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1422/95, specific amounts for these duties should be fixed.
(8) Application of these provisions will have the effect of fixing the representative prices and the additional import duties for the products in question as set out in the Annex to this Regulation.

, Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof, Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), Having regard to the opinion of the  European Parliament (2), Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3), Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 of 30 June 1981 on the common organization of the markets in the sugar sector (4), as last amended by Regulation  (EEC) No 229/87 (5), provides for the application of production quota arrangements for the 1986/87 to 1990/91 marketing years and fixes the basic quantities of A and B production for the 1986/87 and 1987/88 marketing years; whereas the basic quantities  of A and B production and the charges to which producers will be liable under these arrangements for the 1988/89 to 1990/91 marketing years must be determined by 1 January 1988; Whereas the aim of the production quota arrangements in the sugar sector is  to convert production to the possibilities for disposal and ensure that all losses resulting from the Community's surplus production are covered by the producers' financial contributions; whereas these contributions are made by collecting a levy on  basic production that applies to all production of A and B sugar but which may not exceed 2 % of the intervention price for white sugar and a B levy on production of B sugar which may not exceed 37,5 % of the intervention price; whereas manufacturers of  isoglucose share in these contributions under certains conditions; Whereas the estimates made pursuant to Article 28 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 as regards consumption, production, exportable surpluses and total losses for the 1986/87 marketing  year suggest with virtual certainty that not only will overall losses not be covered as a result of the limits placed on such contributions, but that the scale of the likely deficit for just the first year of implementation is such as to call into  question the implementation of the self-financing principle in this sector; whereas, moreover, because of the severe budgetary constraints on the Community, it is out of the question for the Community to stand in for the producers in question and assume  responsibility, even on a temporary basis, for the abovementioned deficit; Whereas it is desirable, until sufficient time has elapsed, not to call into question before the date laid down the production quota arrangements that must, in any case, apply to  the 1986/87 and 1987/88 marketing years; whereas, however, owing to the likely scale of the loss not covered by the producers' contributions for the 1986/87 marketing year, this loss should be eliminated by making provision for the introduction of a  special elimination levy for the 1986/87 marketing year; whereas, in such circumstances, this special elimination levy should be collected at the same time as the payment of the balance of the production levies for the 1986/87 marketing year, namely  before 15 December 1987; Whereas the special elimination levy should be drawn up for each undertaking on the basis of its share in the revenue derived from the production levies that it will have paid in respect of the 1986/87 marketing year; whereas,  for this purpose, a coefficient valid for the Community as a whole and representing, for the 1986/87 marketing year, the ratio between, on the one hand, the total loss recorded pursuant to Article 28 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1785/81 and, on the other  hand, all the revenue derived from the production levies in question should be determined; whereas provision should also be made for the sellers of beet and the sellers of cane to share in the elimination of the outstanding loss for the 1986/87  marketing year; Whereas the participation of sugar-beet sellers and sugar-cane sellers in the elimination of the loss not covered by the 1986/87 marketing year may be hindered in particular when not only the sugar-beet delivered during that year has  been entirely paid for by the manufacturers but also the bulk of the sugar-beet delivered during the 1987/88 year; whereas sugar-beet growers or sugar-cane growers should therefore be enabled to pay their part of the levy in respect of the sugar-beet  delivered during the 1986/87 or the 1987/88 marketing year; whereas irrespective of the marketing year adopted for such participation, the latter should not exceed that resulting from the 1986/87 marketing year,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1914/87 of 2 July 1987 introducing a special elimination levy in the sugar sector for the 1986/87 marketing year', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/81/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on mineral oils(1), and in particular Article 8(4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Denmark has requested authorisation to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to heavy fuel oil and heating oil used by energy-intensive firms to produce heating and hot water, excluding the mineral oils referred to in Article 8(2)(f) of Directive 92/81/EEC.
(2) The other Member States have been notified of Denmark's request.
(3) The aim of the differentiated rate of duty is partly to compensate for the fact that the actual tax is much higher than was intended when the national measures were adopted increasing the CO2 and energy taxes on the use of heavy fuel oil and heating oil to produce heating and hot water.
(4) The reduced rate is granted to firms which agree to improve their energy efficiency. The financial details of the application are as follows:
>TABLE>
The zero-rate for heating oil is authorised by the second paragraph of Article 5(3) of Council Directive 92/82/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of the rates of excise duties (92/82/EEC) on mineral oils(2). In Denmark, the monitoring charge is DKK 50 (EUR 6,7) per 1000 litres of heating oil.
(5) The differentiated rate of excise duty proposed by Denmark therefore complies with the minimum rates referred to in Articles 5 and 6 of Directive 92/82/EEC.
(6) The requested exemption is in keeping with environmental policy. In particular, the reduced rate is granted only to firms which agree to improve their energy efficiency.
(7) On the basis of information available, except for the agricultural sector, the Commission and all the Member States consider that the application of differentiated rates of excise duty to heavy fuel oil and heating oil will not result in a distortion of competition contrary to the common interest nor will it hinder the operation of the internal market.
(8) The exemptions should be granted for a limited duration. A period of six years, with the possibility of an extension, is compatible with the requirements of Community tax policy.
(9) The Commission periodically reviews reductions and exemptions to check that they will not distort competition, hinder the operation of the internal market or be incompatible with Community policy on protection of the environment,","{'title': '2002/264/EC: Council Decision of 25 March 2002 authorising Denmark to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty to heavy fuel oil and heating oil used by certain firms, in accordance with Article 8(4) of Directive 92/81/EEC', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nDenmark is hereby authorised to apply a differentiated rate of excise duty, from 1 February 2002 to 31 January 2008, to heavy fuel oil and heating oil used by energy-intensive firms to produce heating and hot water.\n\nThe maximum amount of the authorised differentiation in the excise duty is EUR 0,0095 per kg on heavy fuel oil and EUR 0,008 per litre on heating oil.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe reductions in excise duty referred to in Article 1 must comply with the terms of Directive 92/82/EEC, and in particular the minimum rates laid down in Articles 5 and 6 thereof.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision shall be without prejudice to Article 8(2)(f) of Directive 92/81/EEC.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\nThis Decision shall expire on 31 January 2008.'}, {'id': '5', 'title': 'Article 5', 'text': 'Article 5\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nDone at Brussels, 25 March 2002.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nA.

","COMMISSION  DECISION
of 7 October 1985
terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of standard wood particle board originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Spain and Yugoslavia
(85/470/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 9 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
1. In 1984 the Commission received a complaint lodged by the European Confederation of Wood Working Industries for the EEC countries on behalf of producers of standard wood particle board whose collective output constitutes the majority of Community production of the product in question. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury resulting therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced, by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2), the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of standard wood particle board falling within Common Customs Tariff heading No ex 44.18 and corresponding to Nimexe codes 44.18-11, ex 44.18-30 and ex 44.18-90 originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Spain and Yugoslavia and commenced an investigation.
2. The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives where appropriate, of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
The majority of the known Community producers and exporters and some importers made their views known in writing. Some exporters and some importers requested and were granted hearings.
Certain submissions were also made by or on behalf of Community processors of the product concerned.
3. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
- EEC producers:
- NV Spano, Oostrozebeke, Belgium
- NV Unilin, Wielsbeke, Belgium
- Caberboard Ltd, Cowie, United Kingdom
- Aaronson Bros plc, South Molton, Devon, United Kingdom
- Falco SpA, Pomposa, Italy
- ITALP, Pomponesco, Italy
- STAT SpA, Ginovo, Italy
- Frati Luigi SpA, Pomponesco, Italy
- Isory SA, Lisieux, France
- R.O.L. SA, Niort, France
- Emsland Spanplatten KG, Papenburg, Germany
- Greco Spanplatten GmbH, Meppen, Germany
- Gebr. Kuennemeyer GmbH, Co KG, Germany
- Kunststoff und Spanplatten GmbH Co KG, Germany
- Gebr. Cloos GmbH, Germany
- EEC importers:
- Flatau Dick (Plywood and board) Ltd, London, United Kingdom
- Polish Timber Products Ltd, London, United Kingdom
- Scantlebury and Hemingway Ltd, London, United Kingdom
- Tafinsa Boards Limited, London, United Kingdom
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from the majority of complainant Community producers, the majority of exporters and some importers and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
The complainants requested and received all information available to the Commission relevant to the complainant's interest having been used by the Commission during the investigation and having had a decisive influence on its findings.
The information disclosed was not regarded by the Commission as confidential within the meaning of Article 8 of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84.
B. Injury
4. With regard to the allegation that imports of standard wood particle board from the countries concerned caused injury to the Community producers of this product, the investigation showed that imports to the Community from these countries increased from approximately 290 000 cubic metres in 1981 and 1982 to 480 000 cubic metres in 1983 but fell to 420 000 cubic metres in 1984. This reduction represented a fall in market share from 6,5 % in 1983 to 5,4 % in 1984 and since EEC consumption during this period rose by approximately 5 % the reduction was therefore not only in absolute terms, but also relative to Community consumption.
Individually, in 1984 none of the exporting countries concerned held more than 1,4 % of the Community market, the lowest individual share being 0,2 %.
5. As far as the complainant companies who cooperated in the investigation are concerned, both their production and sales in the Community of standard wood particle board increased steadily from 1981 to 1984, the figures for production being 3,8 million cubic metres in 1981 and 4,5 million cubic metres in 1984 and for EEC sales 3,1 million cubic metres in 1981 and 3,5 milion cubic metres in 1984. In view of the increase in Community consumption during this period, these sales represented a relatively stable market share in the Community of approximately 45 %.
Imports into the Community from countries not concerned in the investigation, particularly Austria, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland, increased during the same period both absolutely and in relation to EEC consumption, their cumulated market share having risen from 14 % in 1981 to 15 % in 1984.
6. Although, in general, the development of prices throughout the Community prior to and during the refence period shows relatively small increases, the Commission considers that, in general, the available evidence on quantities imported from both the countries concerned and from other countries, the pricing of those imports and the pricing of the products of Community producers show that the fact that prices did not increase more rapidly cannot be conclusively attributed to the imports in question. The Commission did, however, find isolated regional instances of price depression which could be attributed to certain of the imports in question but the injurious effect of these imports on prices was restricted both in time and to the immediate areas of the port of entry and, taking account of the quantities concerned, could not be considered material on a Community basis.
7. In addition, most of the the complainant companies achieved profitability, albeit modest, in thir sale of standard particle board in the Community during the refeence period.
8. Thus the Commission, in taking account of the evidence available, is of the opinion that, to the extent to which the complainant companies may have sustained injury during the reference period which could be conclusively attributed to the imports in question, the injury cannot be described as material. C. Dumping
9. In view of the above findings with respect to injury the Commission considered it unnecessary to investigate the allegation of dumping with regard to the imports in question since anti-dumping measures may in general only be taken where examination shows that there has been dumping during the period under investigation, that material injury has been caused thereby and that the interests of the Community call for such measures.
In these circumstances it is considered appropriate that the proceeding be terminated without the imposition of protective measures.
No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee,","{'title': '85/470/EEC: Commission Decision of 7 October 1985 terminating the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of standard wood particle board originating in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Spain and Yugoslavia'}"

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 509/2002(2), and in particular Article 29(4) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Under quotas Nos 09.4086 and 09.4554 as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2475/2000(3) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1361/2002(4) establishing certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreements with Slovenia and Lithuania respectively, the Slovene and Lithuanian authorities have introduced veterinary checks ensuring that the milk powder for export to the Community complies with the conditions laid down in Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products(5), as last amended by Directive 94/71/EC(6), and in Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products and repealing Directives 85/358/EEC and 86/469/EEC and Decisions 89/187/EEC and 91/664/EEC(7).
(2) In view of the difficulties that these veterinary checks have caused for importers holding licences issued during the first six months of 2002, in the case of imports originating in Lithuania, the validity period of those licences was extended to 30 September 2002 and 31 January 2003 respectively by Commission Regulations (EC) No 1333/2002(8) and (EC) No 1925/2002(9), derogating from Regulation (EC) No 2535/2001(10), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2302/2002(11).
(3) Given that these difficulties persist and, furthermore, that the veterinary checks carried out by the Lithuanian and Slovene authorities have led to the temporary suspension of certain operators from the possibility to export dairy products, the validity of the import licences issued in January and July 2002 under quota No 09.4554 in the case of Lithuania, and the import licences issued in July 2002 under quota No 09.4086 in the case of Slovenia, should be extended to 30 June 2003.
(4) Prior to carrying out imports originating in Latvia under quota No 09.4549 as provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1362/2002 of 22 July 2002 establishing concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and providing for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Latvia(12), importers holding licences issued for the second six months of 2002 carried out representative tests on the milk powder. It was discovered that all available stocks of milk powder in that country were contaminated with chloramphenicol and that the exporting firms concerned were no longer able to deliver the quantities for which contracts had been concluded before the end of the period of validity of the licences.
(5) The validity of the import licences issued in July 2002 under quota No 09.4549 for imports originating in Latvia should therefore be extended to 30 June 2003.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 of 18 January 2011 fixing for 2011 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks, applicable in EU waters and, for EU vessels, in certain non-EU waters (1) and in particular points 7.1, 7.3 and 7.6 of Annex IIB thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Point 5.1 of Annex IIB to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 specifies the maximum number of days on which EU vessels of an overall length equal to or greater than 10 meters carrying on board the regulated gears (trawls, Danish seines and similar gears of mesh size equal to or lager than 32 mm and gill-nets of mesh size equal to or larger than 60 mm and bottom long-lines) may be present within ICES Divisions VIIIc and IXa excluding the Gulf of Cadiz from 1 February 2011 to 31 January 2012.
(2) Point 7.1 of Annex IIB to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 allows the Commission to allocate an additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear, on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place between 1 February 2010 and 31 January 2011.
(3) Point 7.6 of Annex IIB to Regulation (EU) No 57/2011 allows the Commission to exceptionally allocate additional days during the 2011 management period on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place from 1 February 2004 to 31 January 2010 and which have not been subject of prior request for additional days.
(4) On 3 and 21 June 2011 Spain submitted requests in accordance with point 7.2 of that Annex including data showing that eight fishing vessels have permanently ceased activities between 1 February 2004 and 31 January 2010 and three fishing vessels have permanently ceased activities between 1 February 2010 and 31 January 2011, and which have not been subject of prior request for additional days.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in the Annex to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(2), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2390/2000(3), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardized by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not provide for the compensation system for storage costs to be extended after 1 July 2001. This should therefore be taken into account when fixing the amounts of refunds, in particular with regard to the advance-fixing options.
(7) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Sugar,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1561/2001 of 31 July 2001 fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe rates of the refunds applicable to the basic products appearing in Annex A to Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 and listed in Article 1(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, are fixed as shown in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 1 August 2001.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 31 July 2001.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrederik Bolkestein\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 178, 30.6.2001, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ L 177, 15.7.2000, p. 1.\n\n(3) OJ L 276, 28.10.2000, p. 3.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 31 July 2001 fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain products in the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty\n\n>TABLE>'}]}"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for  implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different  Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the  other existing financial instruments (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2082/93 (2), and in  particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the  Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article  9 (8) to (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural  Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with  the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as  amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2081/93 (4); whereas, however, the last subparagraph of Article 5  (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming  procedures, Member States may submit in a Single Programming Document the information required for  the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88  and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10  (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission  adopts a single decision in a Single Document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and  the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 94/169/EC (5), an initial list of declining  industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the period 1994 to 1996;
Whereas the Flemish Government has submitted to the Commission on 22 April 1994 the Single  Programming Document referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of  Limburg; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation  (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under  this Single Programming Document is eligible pursuant to Article 33 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No  4253/88, from 1 January 1994;
Whereas the Single Programming Document submitted by this Member State includes a description of  the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional  Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned  use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial  instruments in implementing the Single Programming Document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged  with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between  assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments,  including the ECSC and the other actions for structural purposes;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the Single Programming Document in  accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by  analogy in the establishment of the Single Programming Document; whereas it has declared itself  prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory  provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of  Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;

Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (3),  as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (4), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide  financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions  for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (5), as amended by  Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (6), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial  support;
Whereas the Single Programming Document has been established in agreement with the Member State  concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas the Single Programming Document satisfies the conditions and includes the information  required by Article 14 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the  relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the  principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the  information provided for by the Flemish authorities has not yet allowed this verification; whereas,  payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of  the said Regulation until the Commission will have verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC)  No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from  more than one Fund;

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10(7) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 10(1) to (4) thereof sets out specific provisions for the evaluation of products used in the Union as silage additives at the date that Regulation became applicable.
(2) In accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 were entered in the Community Register of Feed Additives as existing products belonging to the functional group of silage additives, for all animal species.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, applications were submitted for the authorisation of the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 as feed additives for all animal species, requesting those additives to be classified in the category ‘technological additives’ and in the functional group ‘silage additives’. Those applications were accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 23 May 2012 (2) that, under the proposed conditions of use, the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 do not have an adverse effect on animal health, human health or the environment. The preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U and NCIMB 30094 have the potential to improve the production of silage from all forages by increasing the preservation of dry matter and reducing the pH. The preparation of Lactobacillus plantarum VTT E-78076 has the potential to improve the production of silage from easy and moderately difficult to ensile material by reducing the pH and ammonia nitrogen. The preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 have the potential to improve the production of silage from easy ensile material by reducing the pH and dry matter loss. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additives in feed submitted by the Community Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of the preparations of Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 23375, CNCM I-3235, DSM 19457, DSM 16565, DSM 16568, LMG 21295, CNCM MA 18/5U, NCIMB 30094, VTT E-78076, ATCC PTSA-6139, DSM 18112, DSM 18113, DSM 18114, ATCC 55943 and ATCC 55944 shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of those preparations should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for interested parties to prepare themselves to meet the new requirements resulting from the authorisation.

Whereas fodder plant seed may not normally be placed on the market unless its packages are labelled with an official label in accordance with the provisions laid down in Directive 66/401/EEC;
Whereas, however, the indelible printing of the required information on the package itself, on the basis of the model laid down for the label, may be authorized;
Whereas the Commission has already granted such an authorization by Decision 87/309/EEC (3);

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1670/2000(2), and in particular Article 31(10) and (14) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The third indent of Article 31(10) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 stipulates that in the case of differentiated refunds the refund is to be paid on presentation of proof that the products have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund was fixed. Exceptions to that rule are possible provided that conditions are laid down offering equivalent guarantees.
(2) In the event that export refunds are differentiated according to destination, Article 18(1) and (2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1557/2000(4), stipulates that part of the refund, calculated using the lowest rate for the refund, is to be paid on application by the exporter once proof is furnished that the product has left the customs territoriy of the Community.
(3) Under special arrangements with certain third countries, the refund rate applicable to the export of certain milk products to those countries may be lower, in some cases by a large amount, than the refund normally applied. It is also possible that no refund may be fixed so that no lowest rate of the refund can be fixed either.
(4) Council Regulation (EC) No 2851/2000(5) establishes certain concessions in the form of Community tariff quotas for certain agricultural products and provides for an adjustment, as an autonomous and transitional measure, of certain agricultural concessions provided for in the Europe Agreement with Poland. One of those concessions results in a differentiation of refunds from 1 January 2001 for certain products falling within CN code 0405 as a result of the abolition of refunds on those products exported to Poland.
(5) Article 20b of Commission Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 of 26 January 1999 laying down special detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 as regards export licences and export refunds in the case of milk and milk products(6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2884/2000(7), provides for the obligation for operators to present to the competent authorities, on importation into Poland of certain products falling within CN code 0405, a certified copy of the export licence and the relevant export declaration. The export licence must include specific information guaranteeing that no export refund has been granted on the products in question. The Polish authorities have undertaken to ensure that Article 20b of Regulation (EC) No 174/1999 is complied with.
(6) Those special arrangements must therefore be taken into account when applying the above provisions of Regulations (EC) No 1255/1999 and (EC) No 800/1999 so that exporters are not burdened with unnecessary costs in their trade with third countries. To that end, when the lowest refund rate is determined, no account is to be taken of the rates fixed under the conditions and for the particular destination in question.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular Article 38(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 38(1) and (3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that during the 2001/2002 to 2005/2006 marketing years adjustment aid is to be granted as an intervention measure to the Community's preferential raw cane sugar refining industry, together with an additional basic aid for raw cane sugar produced in the French overseas departments.
(2) Article 38(4) lays down that the adjustment aid and additional aid may be adjusted to take account of economic trends in the sugar sector, particularly the margins for manufacturing white beet sugar and refining raw cane sugar. For the 2000/2001 and previous marketing years, the adjustment aid and additional aid were determined, inter alia, on the basis of the applicable storage levy. For the 2001/2002 marketing year, the compensation system for storage costs was abolished and the aid in question set on the assumption that the balance between the manufacturing margin and the refining margin has not been affected by the abolition of the aforementioned system and pending a study of economic developments in the two sectors to establish in particular whether the way in which the two margins have developed warrants continuation of the adjustment aid and additional aid.
(3) The analyses carried out lead to the conclusion that the aid to the refining industry should continue to maintain balance with the manufacture of white beet sugar in the period for which prices in the sugar sector are set, i.e. for the 2002/2003 to 2005/2006 marketing years. The level of the aid set for the 2001/2002 marketing year is commensurate with developments in the situation in particular after the abolition of the compensation system for storage costs.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 of 29 December 1981 on the common organization of the market in fishery products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3571/90 (2), and in particular Article 25 thereof,
Whereas, pursuant to Article 25 of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81, to the extent necessary to allow economically important exports of the products specified in Article 1 (2) of that Regulation to be effected on the basis of the prices for those products on  the world market, the difference between those prices and the prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund; whereas Article 25 (2) also provides that the refund is to be the same for the whole Community;
Whereas Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 3571/90 lays down that up to 31 December 1992 a decision may be taken in accordance with the procedure in Article 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 to adopt measures involving adaptations of the measures covered  by Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81, the application of which is to be limited to the same date; whereas these measures must be designed to ensure the consistent application of the abovementioned Regulation in the territory of the former German Democratic  Republic, taking into account the specific situation obtaining in that territory and the particular difficulties attending implementation of the Regulation in question;
Whereas a major part of the annual production of carp originating in that territory, estimated at 6 000 tonnes, can find an outlet, in the current state of the market, only as exports to certain third countries; whereas the prices for the product in  question recorded on the markets of those countries are generally lower than the production costs for the product, to which the packaging and transport costs have still to be added;
Whereas it is desirable, in order to prevent the Community market in carp from being destabilized and to ensure a fair income to the producers concerned, that the application of Article 25 of Regulation (EEC) No 3796/81 be adapted for a limited period  to the situation of those producers by granting a refund on their exports of carp to certain third countries;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 2 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 110/76 of 19 January 1976 (3) laying down general rules for granting export refunds on fishery products and criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds, the refunds must be fixed taking  into account the existing situation and the future trend with regard, on the one hand, to prices and availabilities of fishery products on the Community market, and prices for fishery products on the world market on the other; whereas account should  also be taken, pursuant to (b) of the said Article, of the aims of the common organization of the market in fishery products, and of the costs as referred to in (c) and the economic significance of the proposed exports as mentioned in (d);
Whereas, pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 110/76, prices on the Community market are to be determined taking into account the ruling prices which are most favourable from the exportation point of view; whereas prices on the world market must  be established taking into account the prices referred to in paragraph 2 of the said Article;
Whereas the application of the abovementioned rules to the current situation on the carp market and to the future trend of that market, and in particular to the prices for that product in the Community and on the markets of the third countries  concerned, leads to the fixing of the amount of the refund at ECU 780 per tonne;
Whereas, pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation (EEC) No 110/76, the amount of the refund is to be fixed for a period of three months; whereas the possible quantity likely to be exported over this period should not exceed 2 500 tonnes;

Approval or recognition as equivalent are no longer provided for in the United Kingdom. The National Council for Vocational Qualifications has been replaced by another authority. It is not considered necessary to specify the competent authority in the Directive.
(5) The new special basic training introduced in Austria for nurses specialising in the care of children and young people and for psychiatric nurses is to be included in Annex C to Directive 92/51/EEC. This training leads to a comparable level of qualification, and, on completion, to a similar level of responsibility and activity, as a post-secondary course as described in Article 1(a), first subparagraph, second indent (i) of Directive 92/51/EEC.

Whereas this programme, as modified by letter dated 16 December 1994, was approved by Commission Decision 95/32/EC (1), whereas that Decision was amended by Decisions 95/209/EC (2), 95/416/EC (3), 96/38/EC (4), 96/140/EC (5), 97/24/EC (6) and 97/354/EC (7);

Whereas this request involves aid for potatoes for food production; whereas the request for aid is in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Accession, and in particular Article 138 thereof; whereas potatoes are listed in Annex II to the Treaty and are therefore subject to the provisions of Articles 39 to 46 of the Treaty establishing the common agricultural policy; whereas the Commission by Decisions 96/38/EC and 97/24/EC accepted such aid for fruit and certain vegetables which benefited before Accession from a similar system of support as did potatoes; whereas the form of the aid reflects principles of the reformed common agricultural policy and so may be deemed to be appropriate;
Whereas by letter dated 11 June 1997 Austria notified the Commission of a request for rectification of its Decision 97/354/EC; whereas this request appears to be justified since this Decision aims to adapt the transitional aid measures to certain provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1868/94 (8); whereas this Regulation in its Article 6(2) provides flexibility on the entire production quota of starch potatoes, not only a residual quantity as constitutes that under price category B;

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Having consulted the Committee of the Regions,

(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Council Decision 2006/512/EC (5), which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for the adoption of measures of general scope and designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, inter alia, by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument with new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the statement by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission (6) concerning Decision 2006/512/EC, for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) As regards Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, Regulation (EC) No 1923/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7) introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny only for certain implementing measures which were concerned by the amendments. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be adapted for the remaining implementing powers.
(5) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to approve rapid tests, to extend certain provisions to other products of animal origin, to adopt implementing rules including the method to confirm Bovine Spongiform Encepalopathy (BSE) in ovine and caprine animals, to modify the Annexes and to adopt transitional measures.

fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organisation of the market in rice(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 13(3) and (15) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95, provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for rice and broken rice on the world market on the other. The same Article provides that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the rice market and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports and the need to avoid disturbances of the Community market with limits resulting from agreements concluded in accordance with Article 300 of the Treaty.
(3) Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1361/76(3) lays down the maximum percentage of broken rice allowed in rice for which an export refund is fixed and specifies the percentage by which that refund is to be reduced where the proportion of broken rice in the rice exported exceeds that maximum.
(4) Export possibilities exist for a quantity of 5700 tonnes of rice to certain destinations. The procedure laid down in Article 7(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1162/95(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2305/2002(5), should be used. Account should be taken of this when the refunds are fixed.
(5) Article 13(5) of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the export refund on rice and broken rice is being calculated.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) A separate refund should be fixed for packaged long grain rice to accommodate current demand for the product on certain markets.
(8) The refund must be fixed at least once a month; whereas it may be altered in the intervening period.
(9) It follows from applying these rules and criteria to the present situation on the market in rice and in particular to quotations or prices for rice and broken rice within the Community and on the world market, that the refund should be fixed as set out in the Annex hereto.
(10) For the purposes of administering the volume restrictions resulting from Community commitments in the context of the WTO, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund should be restricted.
(11) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Cereals,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 801/2003 of 8 May 2003 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe export refunds on the products listed in Article 1 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 with the exception of those listed in paragraph 1(c) of that Article, exported in the natural state, shall be as set out in the Annex hereto.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nWith the exception of the quantity of 5700 tonnes provided for in the Annex, the issue of export licences with advance fixing of the refund is suspended.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on 9 May 2003.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 8 May 2003.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 329, 30.12.1995, p. 18.\n\n(2) OJ L 62, 5.3.2002, p. 27.\n\n(3) OJ L 154, 15.6.1976, p. 11.\n\n(4) OJ L 117, 24.5.1995, p. 2.\n\n(5) OJ L 348, 21.12.2002, p. 92.\n\nANNEX\n\nto the Commission Regulation of 8 May 2003 fixing the export refunds on rice and broken rice and suspending the issue of export licences\n\n>TABLE>\n\nNB:\n\nThe product codes and the ""A"" series destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3846/87 (OJ L 366, 24.12.1987, p. 1) as amended.\n\nThe numeric destination codes are set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1779/2002 (OJ L 269, 5.10.2002, p. 6).\n\nThe other destinations are defined as follows:\n\nR01 Switzerland, Liechtenstein, communes of Livigno and Campione d\'Italia.\n\nR02 Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Malta, Egypt, Israel, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, Ex-Spanish Sahara, Cyprus, Jordan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Eritrea, West Bank/Gaza Strip, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czech Republic, Slovenia, Slovakia, Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, Russia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, Ukraine, Kazakstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan.\n\nR03 Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, Venezuela, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Bermuda, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, A40 except the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Turks and Caicos Islands, A11 except Suriname, Guyana, Madagascar.'}]}"

Whereas the Europe Agreement also provides for the possibility of Bulgaria converting limited quantities of live animal exports into quantities of meat; whereas Bulgaria has asked the Community to convert 1 000 tonnes of live animals expressed as carcase weight bone-in that may be exported into the Community in 1996 into 1 000 tonnes of meat; whereas this conversion concerns only a limited portion of the quantities of those products originating in Bulgaria that may enter the Community under Community tariff quotas; whereas, therefore, it should be accepted;
Whereas, as a result, it is necessary to adapt the quantities laid down for Bulgaria in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 3016/95 as adapted by Regulation (EC) No 284/96;

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A(I) to Directive 90/425/EEC (1), and in particular Article 17(3)(a) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/156/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing the movement and importation from third countries of equidae (2), and in particular Article 12(1) and (4), and the introductory phrase of Article 19 and points (a) and (b) of Article 19 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down conditions applicable to imports into the Union, inter alia, of semen, ova and embryos of the equine species. Those conditions are to be at least equivalent to those applicable to trade between Member States.
(2) Directive 2009/156/EC lays down animal health conditions for the importation into the Union of live equidae. It provides that imports of equidae into the Union are only authorised from those third countries that meet certain animal health requirements.
(3) Commission Decision 2004/211/EC of 6 January 2004 establishing the list of third countries and parts of territory thereof from which Member States authorise imports of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species, and amending Decisions 93/195/EEC and 94/63/EC (3) establishes a list of third countries, or parts thereof where regionalisation applies, from which Member States are to authorise the importation of equidae and semen, ova and embryos thereof, and indicates the other conditions applicable to such imports. That list is set out in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC.
(4) Following the eradication of glanders, Bahrain continued enhanced surveillance and movement restrictions on equidae kept in the northern part of the country. Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC therefore indicates different conditions for the introduction into the Member States of registered horses from the northern and southern parts of that country. Since there has been no case of glanders since September 2011 in Bahrain, it is possible to allow the importation of registered horses under the same conditions from the entire territory of Bahrain.
(5) In order to host an equestrian event of the Global Champions Tour in October 2013, carried out under the auspices of the World Equestrian Federation (FEI), the competent Chinese authorities have requested the recognition of an equine disease-free zone in the Metropolitan area of Shanghai, directly accessible from the nearby international airport. In view of the temporary nature of the purpose-built facilities at the EXPO 2010 parking it is appropriate to foresee only a temporary approval of that zone.
(6) The Chinese authorities have provided guarantees in particular as regards the notifiability in their country of the diseases listed in Annex I to Directive 2009/156/EC and the undertaking to fully comply with Article 12(2)(f) of that Directive as regards the information to the Commission and the Member States. In addition, the Chinese authorities have informed the Commission that the entire group of horses competing in that event will come from and return to Member States and will be kept completely separated from any equidae not of the same origin and health status.
(7) In the light of those guarantees and information provided by the Chinese authorities, it is possible to allow for a limited period of time from a part of the territory of China the re-entry of registered horses after temporary export in accordance with the requirements of Commission Decision 93/195/EEC of 2 February 1993 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for the re-entry of registered horses for racing, competition and cultural events after temporary export (4).
(8) The entries for Bahrain and China in Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended.
(9) Decision 2004/211/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '4.6.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 150/28', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 31 May 2013\namending Annex I to Decision 2004/211/EC as regards the entries for Bahrain and China in the list of third countries and parts thereof from which imports into the Union of live equidae and semen, ova and embryos of the equine species are authorised\n(notified under document C(2013) 2927)\n(Text with EEA relevance)\n(2013/259/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Directive 92/65/EEC lays down conditions applicable to imports into the Union, inter alia, of semen, ova and embryos of the equine species.

All three Directives establish prudential requirements as regards risk management by IORPs, by management and investment companies with regard to UCITS, and by AIFMs, respectively.
(2) An effect of the financial crisis has been that there is over-reliance by investors, including IORPs, UCITS, and alternative investment funds (AIFs), on credit ratings to carry out their investments in debt instruments, without necessarily conducting their own assessments of the creditworthiness of issuers of such debt instruments. In order to improve the quality of the investments made by IORPs, UCITS and AIFs and, therefore, to protect investors in those funds, it is appropriate to require IORPs, management and investment companies with regard to UCITS, and AIFMs to avoid relying solely or mechanistically on credit ratings or using them as the only parameter when assessing the risk involved in the investments made by IORPs, UCITS and AIFs. The general principle against over-reliance on credit ratings should therefore be integrated into the risk-management processes and systems of IORPs, management and investment companies with regard to UCITS, and AIFMs, and adapted to their specificities.
(3) In order to specify further the general principle against over-reliance on credit ratings, which should be introduced into Directives 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union should be delegated to the Commission to ensure that management and investment companies with regard to UCITS, and AIFMs are effectively prevented from over-reliance on credit ratings for assessing the creditworthiness of the assets held. It is appropriate in this regard to amend the powers of the Commission in those Directives to adopt delegated acts in respect of the general provisions regarding risk-management processes and systems employed by management and investment companies with regard to UCITS, and AIFMs. It is of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level, and that it publish the results of such consultations. The Commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.
(4) The relevant measures set out in this Directive should be complementary to other provisions in Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 on credit rating agencies (7). Those provisions set the general objective of reducing over-reliance by investors on credit ratings and should facilitate the achievement of that objective.
(5) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to contribute to the reduction of the over-reliance of IORPs,UCITS and AIFs on credit ratings when making their investments, cannot be sufficiently achieved at the Member State level acting in a coordinated manner and can therefore, by reason of the pan-Union structure and impact of the activities of IORPs, UCITS, AIFs and credit rating agencies, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(6) Directives 2003/41/EC, 2009/65/EC and 2011/61/EU should therefore be amended accordingly.
(7) In accordance with the Joint Political Declaration of Member States and the Commission of 28 September 2011 on explanatory documents (8), Member States have undertaken to accompany, in justified cases, the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of a directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3488/89 of 21 November 1989 laying down the method of decision for certain provisions laid down for agricultural products in the framework of Mediterranean agreements (1), and in particular Article 2 thereof,
Whereas, in accordance with the agreements concluded with various Mediterranean third countries, the Community may decide to alter the entry price for certain species of fruit and vegetables originating in such countries, taking account of the annual  reviews of trade flows by product and country pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 451/89 of 20 February 1989 concerning the procedure to be applied to certain agricultural products originating in various Mediterranean third countries (2);
Whereas examination of the prospects for export flows from Mediterranean third countries in the light of the overall trend on the Community market points to the need to alter the entry price for oranges, clementines, mandarins and other similar citrus  hybrids, lemons and tomatoes;
Whereas the alteration of the entry price must, for each product concerned, relate to the amount to be deducted as customs duties from the representative prices recorded in the Community for the calculation of the entry price referred to in Article 24  of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1623/91 (4); whereas, according to product and origin, reductions, as appropriate, of one  third or one half during trading periods enable the desired objective to be attained; whereas such reductions must apply within the quantitative limits determined, in accordance with the Mediterranean agreements;
Whereas this alteration of the entry price is to apply in respect of specific quantities which must be entered in the accounts during the periods laid down in the agreements; whereas a Community surveillance system must be set up to manage the  arrangements in question; whereas the Commission must inform the Member States as soon as the quantities laid down in the Mediterranean agreements and specified in this Regulation have been reached;
Whereas the products in question are subject, moreover, to a system of tariff quotas when they originate in certain countries; whereas the abovementioned Community surveillance system is accordingly to apply only outside the period of statistical  monitoring introduced to administer the quotas;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 of 18 September 2000 introducing exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process, amending Regulation (EC) No 2820/98 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1763/1999 and (EC) No 6/2000(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 607/2003(2), and in particular Article 12(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 764/2003(3) suspended, for a period of three months, the preferential arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 for sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 imported from Serbia and Montenegro.
(2) At the basis of that decision were findings made in Serbia and Montenegro according to which the system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar of CN codes 1701 and 1702 did not allow the competent authorities of this beneficiary country to verify the originating status of the products and to provide administrative cooperation as required for the verification of evidence of origin.
(3) The suspension measure was consequently decided in application of the provisions laid down in Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.
(4) Article 12(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000 states that, on conclusion of the period of suspension, the Commission shall decide either to terminate or to extend the suspension measure.
(5) There has been no significant change in the situation in Serbia and Montenegro with regard to the deficiencies found in their system of certification and control of the preferential origin of sugar, despite the ongoing efforts of the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro. Moreover, a reasonable amount of time is needed for the situation to be redressed.
(6) The Commission therefore considers that the suspension measure should be extended for an additional period of six months, insofar as sugar of CN codes 1701 or 1702 declared as originating in Serbia and Montenegro is concerned, in application of Article 12(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000.

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 95 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consultation of the Scientific Committee on Food, pursuant to Article 6 of Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption(3),
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(4),
Whereas:
(1) Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs(5) lays down a list of sweeteners that may be used in the Community and their conditions of use.
(2) Since 1996, two new sweeteners, sucralose and the salt of aspartame and acesulfame, have been found acceptable for use in food by the Scientific Committee on Food.
(3) The opinion of the Scientific Committee on Food on cyclamic acid and its sodium and calcium salts (which led to the establishment of a new acceptable daily intake (ADI)) and recent studies on the intake of cyclamates lead to a reduction of the maximum usable doses of cyclamic acid and its sodium and calcium salts.
(4) The designation of certain food categories in Directive 94/35/EC should be adapted to take into account Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to food supplements(6) and of specific directives adopted for some groups of foodstuffs listed in Annex I to Council Directive 89/398/EEC(7).
(5) The use of the food additives concerned complies with the general criteria laid down in Annex II to Directive 89/107/EEC.
(6) Articles 53 and 54 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety(8) establish procedures for taking emergency measures in relation to food of Community origin or imported from a third country. They allow the Commission to adopt such measures in situations where food is likely to constitute a serious risk to human health, animal health or the environment and where such risk cannot be contained satisfactorily by measures taken by the Member State(s) concerned.
(7) The measures necessary for implementation of Directive 94/35/EC should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission(9).

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Directive 2009/158/EC of 30 November 2009 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs (1), and in particular Article 25(1)(b) and Article 26(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 of 8 August 2008 laying down a list of third countries, territories, zones or compartments from which poultry and poultry products may be imported into and transit through the Community and the veterinary certification requirements (2) lays down veterinary certification requirements for those commodities. Those requirements take into account whether or not additional guarantees or specific conditions are required due to the Newcastle disease status of those third countries, territories, zones or compartments.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 also lays down conditions for determining whether or not a third country, territory, zone or compartment is to be considered as free from Newcastle disease. One such criterion is that no vaccination against that disease is carried out using vaccines that do not comply with the criteria for recognised Newcastle disease vaccines set out in Part I of Annex VI to that Regulation. Point 2 of Part II of that Annex sets out specific criteria for Newcastle disease vaccines including for inactivated vaccines.
(3) The Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals of the World Organisation for Animal Health (the OIE Manual) sets out requirements for vaccines against Newcastle disease including safety controls at different stages of the manufacturing process.
(4) In the interests of safeguarding the health status of poultry in the Union and in order to facilitate trade in poultry and poultry meat, it is appropriate that the requirements for Newcastle disease vaccines and their use in third countries from where poultry and poultry meat may be imported, take into account the requirements for such vaccines set out in the OIE Manual.
(5) For that purpose, the general criteria for recognised Newcastle disease vaccines set out in Part I of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should refer to the requirements of the OIE Manual, which should be kept as a dynamic reference to take into account the regular updates to that Manual in the light of new scientific developments.
(6) In addition, in view of technical progress that has been made in relation to the production of Newcastle disease vaccines, in particular as regards inactivation techniques, as well as the requirements laid down in the OIE Manual, the specific criteria for inactivated Newcastle disease vaccines set out in point 2 of Part II of Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should be deleted.
(7) It is necessary to amend certain provisions for meat of poultry set out in Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 and the corresponding model veterinary certificate for meat of poultry (POU) set out in Annex I, in order to take account of the amendments to Annex VI to that Regulation.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 798/2008 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) It is appropriate to lay down a date of application of this Regulation, in order to align it with the date of application of Commission Decision 93/152/EEC (3), as amended by Decision 2010/633/EU (4), which introduces corresponding amendments for the criteria for inactivated vaccines against Newcastle disease.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of activities of the different Structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94 (2), and in particular Article 10 (1) last subparagraph thereof,
After consultation of the Advisory Committee on the Development and Conversion of Regions and the Committee pursuant to Article 124 of the Treaty,
Whereas the programming procedure for structural assistance under Objective 2 is defined in Article 9 (6) to 9 (10) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 of 24 June 1988 on the tasks of the Structural Funds and their effectiveness and on coordination of their activities between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 3193/94; whereas however the last subparagraph of Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in order to simplify and to speed up programming procedures, Member States may submit in a single programming document the information required for the regional and social conversion plan referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and the information required at Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas Article 10 (1) last subparagraph of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 foresees that in that case the Commission adopt a single decision in a single document covering the points referred to in Article 8 (3) and the assistance from the Funds referred to in the last subparagraph of Article 14 (3);
Whereas the Commission has established, by Decision 96/472/EC (4), the list of declining industrial areas concerned by Objective 2 for the programming period from 1997 to 1999;
Whereas the global maximum allocation foreseen for the assistance of the Structural Funds for the present single programming document is composed of resources coming from the indicative allocation of Structural Fund commitment appropriations for the period 1997 to 1999 under Objective 2 resulting from Commission Decision 96/468/EC (5) and from unused appropriations of ECU 171 000 of the corresponding single programming document covering the period 1994 to 1996, pursuant to Commission Decision C(96) 4174/2 of 18 December 1996;
Whereas the Italian Government has submitted to the Commission on 8 August 1996 the single programming document as referred to in Article 5 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 for the region of Emilia-Romagna; whereas this document contains the elements referred to in Article 9 (8) of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 and in Article 14 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88; whereas expenditure under this single programming document is eligible as from that date;
Whereas the single programming document submitted by this Member State includes a description of the conversion priorities selected and the applications for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) as well as an indication of the planned use of the assistance available from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the other financial instruments in implementing the single programming document;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, the Commission is charged with ensuring, within the framework of the partnership, coordination and consistency between assistance from the Funds and assistance provided by the EIB and the other financial instruments;
Whereas the EIB has been involved in the drawing up of the single programming document in accordance with the provisions of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, applicable by analogy in the establishment of the single programming document; whereas it has declared itself prepared to contribute to the implementation of this document in conformity with its statutory provisions; whereas, however, it has not yet been possible to evaluate precisely the amounts of Community loans corresponding to the financial needs;
Whereas Article 2 second subparagraph of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1866/90 of 2 July 1990 on arrangements for using the ecu for the purpose of the budgetary management of the Structural Funds (6), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2745/94 (7), stipulates that in the Commission decisions approving a single programming document, the Community assistance available for the entire period and the annual breakdown thereof shall be set out in ecus at prices for the year in which each decision is taken and shall be subject to indexation; whereas this annual breakdown must be compatible with the progressive increase in the commitment appropriations shown in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88; whereas indexation is based on a single rate per year, corresponding to the rates applied annually to budget appropriations on the basis of the mechanism for the technical adjustment of the financial perspectives;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4254/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Regional Development Fund (8), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2083/93 (9), defines the measures for which the ERDF may provide financial support;
Whereas Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4255/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards the European Social Fund (10), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2084/93 (11), defines the measures for which the ESF may provide financial support;
Whereas the single programming document has been established in agreement with the Member State concerned through the partnership defined in Article 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88;
Whereas Article 9 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 lays down that Member States shall provide the relevant financial information to the Commission to permit verification of the respect of the principle of additionality; whereas the analysis, in the framework of partnership, of the information provided for by the authorities of Italy has not yet allowed this verification; whereas payments should therefore be suspended after the first advance provided for in Article 21 (2) of the said Regulation until the Commission has verified the respect of the additionality;
Whereas the present assistance satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88, and so should be implemented by means of an integrated approach involving finance from more than one Fund;
Whereas Article 1 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (12), as last amended by Regulation (EC, Euratom, ECSC) No 2335/95 (13), states that the legal commitments entered into for measures extending over more than one financial year must contain a time limit for implementation which must be specified to the recipient in due form when the aid is granted;
Whereas Article 20 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 provides, subject to available funding, for a single commitment where the Community assistance granted is less than ECU 40 million for the whole programming period;
Whereas it is appropriate to mention that this Decision is ruled by the provisions on the eligibility of expenditure laid down in the Annex to Commission Decision C(97) 1035/6 of 23 April 1997 modifying the decisions approving the Community support frameworks, the single programming documents and the Community initiative programmes in respect of Italy;
Whereas all the other conditions laid down for the grant of aid from the ERDF and the ESF have been complied with,","{'title': '97/703/EC: Commission Decision of 7 May 1997 on the approval of the single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Emilia- Romagna concerned by Objective 2 in Italy (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe single programming document for Community structural assistance in the region of Emilia-Romagna concerned by Objective 2 in Italy, covering the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, is hereby approved.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe single programming document includes the following essential elements:\n\n(a) a statement of the main priorities for joint action, their specific quantified objectives, an appraisal of their expected impact and their consistency with economic, social and regional policies of Italy;\n\nthe main priorities are:\n\n1. strengthening and development of companies,\n\n2. territorial pact for the subregion of Ferrara,\n\n3. strengthening of human resources;\n\n(b) the assistance from the Structural Funds as referred to in Article 4;\n\n(c) the detailed provisions for implementing the single programming document comprising:\n\n- the procedures for monitoring and evaluation,\n\n- the provisions on financial implementation,\n\n- the rules for compliance with Community policies;\n\n(d) the procedures for verifying additionality;\n\n(e) the arrangements for associating the environmental authorities with the implementation of the single programming document;\n\n(f) the means available for technical assistance necessary for the preparation, implementation or adaptation of the measures concerned.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\n1.

(2) Subsequent to the imposition of definitive measures, the Commission received a request for the initiation of an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999, pursuant to Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 2026/97 (""the basic Regulation""), from two Indian producers based in Bombay, Capico Trading Private Limited and Atlas Stainless Corporation Limited. The companies concerned claimed that they were not related to any other exporters of the product concerned in India and that they had not exported the product concerned during the original period of investigation (1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998). They have further stated that they began exporting the product concerned to the Community after the end of the investigation period, or intended to do so.
2. Initiation of an accelerated review
(3) The Commission examined the evidence submitted by the Indian exporting producers concerned and considered it sufficient to justify the initiation of a review in accordance with the provisions of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. After consultation of the Advisory Committee and after the Community industry concerned had been given the opportunity to comment, the Commission initiated, by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities(3), an accelerated review of Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 with regard to the companies concerned and commenced its investigation.
3. Product concerned
(4) The product covered by the current review is the same product as that under consideration in Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999.
4. Parties concerned
(5) The Commission officially advised the companies concerned and the Government of India of the initiation of the procedure. Furthermore, it gave other parties directly concerned the opportunity to make their views known in writing and to request a hearing.
The Commission sent a questionnaire to the companies concerned and received a full reply within the required deadline. The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed necessary for the purpose of the investigation and carried out verification visits at the premises of the companies concerned.
5. Investigation period
(6) The investigation of subsidisation covered the period from 1 January to 31 December 1999 (""the investigation period"").
6. Methodology
(7) The same methodology as that used in the original investigation was applied in the current investigation.
C. RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION
(8) The Commission first examined the status of the companies under investigation in terms of Article 20 of the basic Regulation.
1. Capico Trading Private Ltd
(9) On 20 July 2000, Capico Trading Private Ltd reported to the Commission that it was withdrawing its request for review. The company based this on the fact, which was verified in the investigation, that it had not exported the product concerned to the Community and that its intention to export to the Community had not been realised. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to terminate this review in relation to Capico Trading Private Ltd.
2. Atlas Stainless Corporation
(10) Atlas Stainless Corporation was established around the time of the imposition of definitive measures and registered for sales tax at around the same time. The investigation revealed that the company itself did not produce the product concerned. In fact, its involvement with this product was via a company called Venus Wire Industries Ltd, which produced small quantities on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation. Atlas Stainless Corporation has a ""job worker"" contract with Venus Wire Industries Ltd, whereby Venus Wire Industries Ltd processes raw material into the product concerned on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation for receiving a fee. This contract was agreed on 25 July 1999, i.e. three days after the imposition of definitive measures. Venus Wire Industries Ltd. itself was investigated during the original investigation and is subject to an individual countervailing duty rate of 35,4 %.
(11) The agreement between Venus Wire Industries Ltd and Atlas Stainless Corporation stipulates a fixed price per kilogram of finished product for processing raw material into the product concerned. As regards payment of excise duty on goods domestically sold, Venus Wire Industries Ltd is, unlike Atlas Stainless Corporation, registered as a manufacturer and can claim an indirect tax ""Modvat"" back on its purchases of for example raw materials. There is an agreement between the two companies, whereby Venus Wire Industries Ltd claims back the Madvat on the domestically bought raw materials on behalf of Atlas Stainless Corporation. Moreover, the founder of Atlas Stainless Corporation previously worked as the President of Venus Wire Industries Ltd looking into production at the plant.
(12) In addition, Atlas Stainless Corporation only exported one shipment, of around 1500 kg, to the EU during the investigation period. The shipment concerned was made solely for trial purposes for an importer in the EU, who stated that he only intended to try out the product concerned to test its quality. The importer was a previous customer of Venus Wire Industries Ltd.
(13) Based on the facts verified during the investigation, it was considered that Atlas Stainless Corporation cannot be granted newcomer status since it is not an ""exporter"" in the meaning of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. While Atlas Stainless Corporation was the owner of the product exported to the EU, its one and only export transaction during the investigation period does not constitute true ""export"" in the meaning of Article 20 of the basic Regulation. In addition, Atlas Stainless Corporation made the job worker agreement with Venus Wire Industries Ltd just after the imposition of definitive measures, and the fact that this arrangement was set up at this time by the former President of Venus Wire Industries Ltd gives rise to serious doubts about the true motives of the operation; in fact, the investigation established that Atlas Stainless Corporation has no production facilities and, even more importantly, no significant commercial activities on either the domestic or any other export markets. On the basis of all the evidence, the Commission considered that Atlas Stainless Corporation has not demonstrated that it is an ""exporter"" eligible for an individual duty under Article 20 of the basic Regulation.
Comments from interested parties and Commission's response
(14) Having been informed of the facts and considerations on the basis of which it is intended to terminate this review, Atlas Stainless Corporation and the Government of India gave the following arguments:
(15) Atlas Stainless Corporation argued that although it does not own a manufacturing plant, it owns the raw materials and has a job worker contract with Venus Wire, where it paid the conversion charges to job workers as per contract. For this reason, it claimed it should be considered as manufacturer of the exported product. Moreover, Atlas Stainless Corporation argued that it used the plant facilities of Venus Wire Industries Ltd for specific purposes, and that it had a normal commercial business relationship with Venus Wire Industries Ltd.
(16) As explained above, the Commission does not contest that Atlas was the owner of one shipment of the product exported to the EU. However, it has concluded that the nature of Atlas' operation during the investigation period does not lend itself to a conclusion that it is a genuine producer/exporter which should have an individual duty. Additionally, countervailing measures would be rendered completely ineffective if it were possible for companies (such as Atlas Stainless Corporation), which operate through job worker contracts, to have an individual duty, without reference to the original producer of the product, which may itself be subject to an individual duty. Atlas Stainless Corporation's relationship with Venus Wire Industries Ltd, which includes certain operational links between the companies, and the timing of the establishment of Atlas Stainless Corporation, merely strengthen this conclusion.
(17) The Government of India (GOI) referred to a review request in an anti-dumping proceeding carried out by the US Department of Commerce (DOC) in favour of Atlas Stainless Corporation as regards imports of stainless steel bars. In this regard, the Commission notes that actions of investigating authorities in non-member countries have, by themselves, no bearing on this proceeding.
(18) Moreover, the GOI claimed that the company had offered a price undertaking and that, in the light of Article 15 of the WTO Agreement on the Implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994, special regard must be given to developing country members. In this respect, it is noted that the WTO Agreement on subsidies and countervailing measures does not contain a provision corresponding to Article 15 of the WTO Agreement on the implementation of Article VI of GATT 1994. In any case, no such undertaking has been offered by Atlas Stainless Corporation.
(19) Therefore it is considered fitting to reject the application for newcomer status and to terminate this review without amending the measures in force,",{'title': '2001/724/EC: Commission Decision of 11 October 2001 terminating the review of Council Regulation (EC) No 1599/1999 imposing a definitive countervailing duty on imports of stainless steel wires with a diameter of 1 mm or more originating in India (notified under document number C(2001) 3041)'}

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 of 22 December 1995 on the common organization of the market in rice(3), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 411/2002(4), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 and Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 3072/95 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95(5), as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2993/95(6), on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinized starch, no export refund is to be granted.

establishing common rules for exports
(codified version)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 133 thereof,
Having regard to the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets and to the instruments concerning processed agricultural products adopted in pursuance of Article 308 of the Treaty, in particular the provisions of those instruments which allow for derogation from the general principles that quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect may be replaced solely by the measures provided for in those same instruments,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports (1) has been substantially amended several times (2). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) The common commercial policy should be based on uniform principles, inter alia, as regards exports.
(3) Common rules should therefore be established for exports from the Community.
(4) Exports are almost completely liberalised in all the Member States. It is therefore possible to accept as a Community principle that exports to third countries are not subject to any quantitative restriction, subject to the exceptions provided for in this Regulation and without prejudice to such measures as Member States may take in conformity with the Treaty.
(5) The Commission should be informed if, as a result of unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary.
(6) It is essential that examination should take place at Community level, in particular on the basis of any such information and within an advisory committee, of export terms and conditions, of export trends, of the various aspects of the economic and commercial situation, and of the measures, if any, to be taken.
(7) It may become apparent from this examination that the Community should exercise surveillance over certain exports, or that interim protective measures should be introduced as a safeguard against unforeseen practices. The need for rapid and effective action makes it justifiable for the Commission to be empowered to decide upon such measures, but without prejudice to the subsequent position of the Council, whose responsibility it is to adopt a policy consistent with the interests of the Community.
(8) Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Community should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations.
(9) It is desirable that Member States be empowered, in certain circumstances and provided that their actions are on an interim basis only, to take protective measures individually.
(10) It is desirable that while such protective measures are in operation there should be an opportunity for consultation for the purpose of examining the effects of the measures and of ascertaining whether the conditions for their application are still satisfied.
(11) It is necessary to authorise Member States which are bound by international commitments setting up, in cases of actual or potential supply difficulties, a system for the allocation of oil products between contracting parties to comply with the resulting obligations vis-à-vis third countries, without prejudice to Community provisions adopted to the same end. This authorisation should apply until the adoption by the Council of appropriate measures pursuant to commitments entered into by the Community or all the Member States.
(12) This Regulation should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. Its operation should be complementary to that of the instruments establishing common organisation of agricultural markets, and to that of the special instruments adopted under Article 308 of the Treaty for processed agricultural products. Any overlap between the provisions of this Regulation and the provisions of these instruments, particularly the protective clauses thereof, must however be avoided,","{'header': '7.11.2009 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 291/1', 'title': 'COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1061/2009\nof 19 October 2009\nestablishing common rules for exports\n(codified version)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69 of 20 December 1969 establishing common rules for exports(1)has been substantially amended several times(2).

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Decision 2009/470/EC of 25 May 2009 on expenditure in the veterinary field (1), and in particular Article 23 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on honeybee health (2) gives an overview of the Commission’s actions already undertaken and ongoing as regards honeybee health in the EU. The main subject issue of the Communication is the increased mortality of bees observed worldwide.
(2) In 2009 the EFSA project ‘Bee mortality and bee surveillance in Europe’ (3) concluded that the surveillance systems in the EU are, in general, weak and that there is a lack of data at Member States level and a lack of comparable data at EU level.
(3) In order to improve the availability of data on bee mortality the Commission decided to assist and support certain surveillance studies in Member States on honeybee losses.
(4) Commission Implementing Decision 2012/362/EU (4) granted a financial contribution to the voluntary surveillance study programs on honeybee colony losses implemented by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom for the season 2012–2013.
(5) The studies provide for three field visits in the apiaries to be carried out before winter, after winter and during the productive season.
(6) It is important in this type of study to have comparable data in relation with the losses which are collected in different years. This is particularly valid for surveillance studies on honeybee losses because the climatic conditions alter significantly the results. Therefore, such studies if conducted only for one year can only give partial data which do not offer enough grounds to draw conclusions or trends on such losses.
(7) For the reasons explained above, it is opportune to continue the voluntary surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses in the season starting with the pre-winter control in fall 2013, to be finalised with the post-winter and full productive season controls in 2014.
(8) The studies to be carried out in the season 2013–2014 are based on the document ‘Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses’ (5) produced by the EU reference laboratory (EURL) for bee health listed in Part II of Annex VII to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), which provides guidance to Member States to elaborate their voluntary surveillance studies programs.
(9) The same Member States which took part to the first voluntary surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses in 2012–2013 were invited to send to the Commission their programs for the season 2013–2014 based on the technical document of the EURL for bee health.
(10) Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom have drawn up voluntary surveillance study programs on honeybee colony losses in line with the technical document ‘Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses’ and have requested EU financial support.
(11) A financial contribution should be granted as from 1 July 2013 to the voluntary surveillance study programs on honeybee colony losses implemented by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
(12) Under Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 (7), veterinary measures are to be financed under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund. For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation are to apply.
(13) The payment of the financial contribution should be subject to the condition that the surveillance study programs planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission and to the EURL for bee health.
(14) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '19.10.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 279/67', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION\nof 17 October 2013\nconcerning a financial contribution by the Union to certain Member States to support voluntary surveillance studies on honeybee colony losses for the season 2013–2014\n(notified under document C(2013) 6742)\n(Only the Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish and Swedish texts are authentic)\n(2013/512/EU)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on honeybee health(2)gives an overview of the Commission’s actions already undertaken and ongoing as regards honeybee health in the EU.

For financial control purposes, Articles 9, 36 and 37 of that Regulation are to apply.\n\n((13)) The payment of the financial contribution should be subject to the condition that the surveillance study programs planned have actually been carried out and that the authorities supply all the necessary information to the Commission and to the EURL for bee health.\n\n((14)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Union shall grant Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom financial assistance for their surveillance study programs on honeybee colony losses.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0The financial contribution by the Union\n(a)\nshall be at the rate of 70\xa0% of the eligible costs to be incurred by each Member State referred to in paragraph 1 for the surveillance study programmes on honeybee colony losses and specified in Annex I for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 September 2014;\n(b)\nshall not exceed the following:\n(1)\nEUR 26\xa0837 for Belgium,\n(2)\nEUR 116\xa0417 for Denmark,\n(3)\nEUR 160\xa0445 for Germany,\n(4)\nEUR 64\xa0868 for Estonia,\n(5)\nEUR 78\xa0421 for Greece,\n(6)\nEUR 148\xa0047 for Spain,\n(7)\nEUR 288\xa0801 for France,\n(8)\nEUR 142\xa0212 for Italy,\n(9)\nEUR 86\xa0310 for Latvia,\n(10)\nEUR 70\xa0273 for Lithuania,\n(11)\nEUR 114\xa0209 for Hungary,\n(12)\nEUR 128\xa0015 for Poland,\n(13)\nEUR 29\xa0159 for Portugal,\n(14)\nEUR 92\xa0240 for Slovakia,\n(15)\nEUR 117\xa0416 for Finland,\n(16)\nEUR 74\xa0389 for Sweden,\n(17)\nEUR 109\xa0871 for the United Kingdom,\n(c)\nshall not exceed EUR 348 per visit of an apiary.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The maximum overall contribution authorised by this Decision for the costs incurred for the programmes referred to in Article 1 is set at EUR 1\xa0847\xa0930 to be financed from the General Budget of the European Union.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Expenditure relating to staff costs for performing laboratory tests, sampling or monitoring, and to consumables and overheads dedicated to the surveillance studies shall be eligible in accordance with the rules set out in Annex III.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0The Union’s financial assistance shall be paid following presentation and approval of the reports and supporting documents referred to Article 3(2) and (3).'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n1.\xa0\xa0\xa0The programs shall be carried out in accordance with the technical document ‘Basis for a pilot surveillance project on honey bee colony losses’ and in accordance with the surveillance study programs on honeybee colony losses presented by the Member States.\n2.\xa0\xa0\xa0Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom shall submit to the Commission:\n—\nno later than 1 March 2014 an intermediate technical report on the first visit provided for in the surveillance study program, and\n—\nno later than 31 October 2014 a final technical report on the second and third visits provided for in the surveillance study program,\n—\nthe technical report should be in conformity to a model to be established by the Commission in cooperation with the EU Reference Laboratory for bee health.\n3.\xa0\xa0\xa0Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom shall submit to the Commission:\n—\nno later than 31 December 2014, a paper version and an electronic version of their financial report drawn up in accordance with Annex II,\n—\non request by the Commission, the supporting documents, evidencing all the expenditure referred to in the application for reimbursement.\n4.\xa0\xa0\xa0The outcome of the studies shall be made available to the Commission and the EU Reference Laboratory for bee health.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\nThis Decision is addressed to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Estonia, the Hellenic Republic, the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, Hungary, the Republic of Poland, the Portuguese Republic, the Slovak Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.'}]}"

imposing a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of pentaerythritol originating in Canada and accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Sweden and terminating that proceeding
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 10 and 11 thereof,
After consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In February 1984 the Commission received a supplementary complaint from the European Council of Chemical Manufacturers' Federations (CEFIC) on behalf of the producers representing all Community production of pentaerythritol in which it was requested to extend the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain to include imports of this product originating in Canada and Sweden.
(2) The complaint contained evidence of dumping and material injury therefrom, which was considered sufficient to justify the extension of the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain.
The Commission accordingly announced by a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the extension of the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of pentaerythritol falling within subheading ex 29.04 C I of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE code 29.04-66, to include works originating in Canada and Sweden.
(3) The Commission officially advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(4) All of the known exporters made their views known in writing and have been granted a hearing. With regard to the importers the Commission received information from the following companies:
- Ernst Jaeger, Fabrik Chemischer Rohstoffe GmbH, Duesseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Usvico SpA, Milan, Italy.
(5) Furthermore, submissions were made on behalf of two users of the product concerned in the Community.
(6) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a preliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following companies:
- EEC producers:
- Degussa AG, Frankfurt, Federal Republic of Germany,
- Montedison-Resem, Castellanza, Italy;
- non-EEC exporters:
- Celanese Canada Inc., Canada and its subsidiary Celanese AG, Baar, Switzerland,
- Perstorp Chemicals, Perstorp, Sweden;
- EEC importers:
- KWR Chemicals, London, United Kingdom,
- Chimilux, Paris, France.
(7) The Commission also requested and received information from ICI Ltd, United Kingdom, who had stopped manufacturing the product concerned in the course of 1983.
(8) The investigation of dumping covered the following periods:
- with regard to imports originating in Canada: 1 January 1983 to 31 January 1984,
- with regard to imports originating in Sweden: 1 March 1983 to 29 February 1984.
B. Normal value
(9) Normal value was provisionally determined on the basis of the domestic prices of the Canadian and Swedish producers, who exported to the Community and who provided sufficient evidence concerning their sales to unrelated customers on their domestic market.
C. Export prices
(a) Canada
(10) Since all exports to the Community were made through Celanese AG, Switzerland, who purchased the product concerned from Celanese Canada Inc., its parent company, and who resold it to customers in the Community, the export prices were constructed on the basis of the prices at which the imported product was sold by Celanese AG to independent buyers in the Community.
(b) Sweden
(11) Export prices were determined on the basis of the prices actually paid for the product sold for export to the Community.
D. Comparison
(a) Canada
(12) In comparing normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability resulting from differences in conditions and terms of sale, such as delivery and handling costs in the Community, customs duty, discounts and commissions, insurance, freight, warehousing, palletizing and payment terms.
Account was also taken of a reasonable margin for overheads and profit at Celanese AG.
(13) All comparisons were made at ex-works level.
(b) Sweden
(14) In comparing the normal value with export prices the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences affecting price comparability resulting from differences in conditions and terms of sale, such as discounts and commissions, insurance, freight, customs clearance costs and payment terms.
(15) All comparisons were made at ex-works level.
E. Margin
(16) The above preliminary determination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of the Canadian and Swedish exporters, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community. The weighted average margins amount to 71,9 and 3,6 % respectively.
F. Injury
(17) With regard to the injury caused by the dumped imports the evidence available to the Commission shows that imports of pentaerythritol into the Community from Spain, Canada and Sweden increased from 13 071 tonnes in 1980 to 15 166 tonnes in 1982 which represents an increase of 16,0 % and to 16 785 tonnes in 1983 which represents a further increase of 10,7 %.
(18) The market share held by the product concerned originating in Spain, Canada and Sweden increased from 26,9 % in 1980 to 31,7 % in 1982 and remained almost stable in 1983.
(19) The consequent impact on the Community industry has been a reduction of their sales in the EEC, which decreased from 31 442 tonnes in 1980 to 29 877 tonnes in 1982 representing a decrease of 5 %. In 1983 the total Community sales of the product concerned increased to 33 575 tonnes. Despite this increase in 1983, the market share of the Community producers shows a decrease from 64,6 % in 1980 to 62,8 % in 1983, as opposed to the increased market share held by the dumped imports (see recital 18). Furthermore, production by Community producers, which may also have been affected by the development of consumption in the Community, dropped from 50 931 tonnes in 1980 to 45 247 tonnes in 1983, representing a decrease of 11,2 %. With regard to the capacity utilization of the Community producers, it decreased from 82 % in 1980 to 73 % in 1982; the increase of their capacity utilization to 85 % in 1983 is mainly due to the plant closure of a former Community producer in the same year.
(20) With regard to the development of the sales' prices of the Community producers it has been established that a significant price depression has taken place on their main markets in the Community, particularly in the period 1982 to 1983.
(21) With regard to the development of the profitability of the Community producers, it has been established that the profits realized in 1980 and 1981 by the main Community producer turned into significant losses in 1982 and 1983 and that the profits realized by the other Community producer dropped significantly between 1980 and 1983. (22) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other facts such as the development of consumption in the Community. It has been established that the consumption showed an irregular development, but that the share of the market held by the Community producers dropped, whereas the share of the market held by dumped imports increased (see recitals 18 and 20). Furthermore, one of the exporters concerned disputed strongly that the plant closure of one of the main producers of pentaerythritol in the Community in April 1983 was caused by the dumped imports, but argued that it was due to its outdated technology. Although it may be true that this producer may not have had the most efficient technology, it considered building a new plant, but decided not to do so, because of the depressed market prices of the product concerned. Therefore, the Commission determined that the effect of all the dumped imports of pentaerythritol originating in Spain, Canada and Sweden taken in isolation, have to be considered as constituting material injury to the Community industry concerned.
G. Community interest
(23) In view of the particularly serious difficulties facing the Community industry, the Commission has come to the conclusion that it is in the Community's interests that action be taken.
(24) In order to prevent further injury being caused during the remainder of the proceeding and in view of the high level of the dumping margin with regard to imports of the product concerned originating in Canada (see recital 16), the action should take the form of a provisional anti-dumping duty with regard to imports from Canada.
(25) Since the dumping margin with regard to imports of pentaerythritol originating in Sweden is lower than the dumping margin established with regard to imports originating in Spain in respect of which an undertaking has been accepted (1), it was considered reasonable and appropriate to give the Swedish exporter concerned the opportunity to offer a price undertaking.
H. Undertaking
(26) The Swedish exporter was informed of the main findings of the preliminary investigation and commented on them. Subsequently, he offered a satisfactory price undertaking of which the effect is that the import prices to the Community of pentaerythritol originating in Sweden have been increased.
(27) In these circumstances, the undertaking offered is considered acceptable and the proceeding with regard to imports of pentaerythritol originating in Sweden, therefore, be terminated without the imposition of an anti-dumping duty.
(28) No objection to this course was raised in the Advisory Committee.
I. Rate of duty
(29) Having regard to the extent of injury caused, the rate of the provisional anti-dumping duty with regard to imports of pentaerythritol originating in Canada should be less than the dumping margin provisionally established but adequate to remove the injury caused.
(30) Having taken into account, on the one hand, the selling price necessary to provide an adequate profit to Community producers and, on the other hand, the purchase price of Community importers, the Commission determined the amount of duty necessary to eliminate the injury to be 15 %.
(31) The Canadian exporter was informed of the main findings of the preliminary investigation and commented on them. Furthermore, he was informed of the Commission's intention to impose a provisional anti-dumping duty of 15 %.
(32) A period should be fixed within which the parties concerned may make their views known and request an oral hearing.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 10 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, presented after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for under the above Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88,
Whereas:
A. Procedure
(1) In February 1987 the Commission received a complaint lodged by Euromot (European Committee of Internal Combustion Engine Manufacturers' Association) on behalf of Community producers representing the majority of Community production of the diesel engines concerned. The complaint contained evidence of dumping and of material injury which was considered sufficient to justify the initiation of a proceeding. The Commission accordingly announced by a notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities (2) the initiation of an anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports into the Community of certain diesel engines falling within CN codes ex 8408 10 70, ex 8408 10 80, ex 8408 10 90, ex 8408 90 71, ex 8408 90 75 and ex 8408 90 99, originating in Finland and Sweden and subsequently commenced an investigation.
(2) The Commission officially so advised the exporters and importers known to be concerned, the representatives of the exporting countries and the complainants and gave the parties directly concerned the opportunity to make known their views in writing and to request a hearing.
(3) The majority of the known producers and exporters made their views known in writing. They have requested and have been granted hearings.
(4) No submissions were made on behalf of Community purchasers of the product in question.
(5) The Commission sought and verified all information it deemed to be necessary for the purposes of a perliminary determination and carried out investigations at the premises of the following:
EEC producers
Krupp MaK Maschinenbau GmbH, Germany,
MAN - B&W Diesel AG, Germany,
Motoren-Werke Mannheim AG, Germany,
Stork-Werkspoor Diesel BV, Netherlands,
Fincantieri, Divisione Grande Motori, Italy,
S.E.M.T. Pielstick, France,
CCM Sulzer, France,
Ruston Diesels Ltd, UK,
Mirrlees Blackstone Diesels Ltd, UK,
W.H. Allen Diesels Ltd, UK,
CompaĂąia de Motores Deutz MWM SA, Spain,
Empresa Nacional BazĂĄn, Spain.
Producers in third countries
OY Waertsilae AB, Helsinki, Finland,
Waertsilae Diesel AB, Trollhaettan, Sweden,
hereinafter known as 'the exporters'.
The Commission requested and received detailed written submissions from all the complainant Community producers and the exporters concerned, and verified the information therein to the extent considered necessary.
Because of the complicated technical nature of the product concerned, the extensions of time-limits requested by both the exporters and the complainants - which were granted - and the large number of companies that had to be investigated, the time-limit for completion of the investigation exceeded a 12 month period.
(6) The investigation of dumping covered the period from 1 January 1987 to 31 August 1988.
B. Products
(7) The products concerned by the proceeding are certain diesel engines, used as marine main and auxiliary engines as well as stationary engines for the generation of electricity, of a power exceeding 500 kW with revolutions per minute below 1 200 (medium-speed engines).
Each engine is custom-built to the specific requirements of the customers and includes additional equipment which differs considerably for each order. However, every engine is manufactured to certain specific standards and the components used in the production universally are basically the same. For comparison purposes both Community producers as well as exporters' engines had therefore to be brought back to a so-called 'basic engine'. (Completed engine less additional equipment).
These 'basic engines' that were used for comparison purposes are like products for the following reasons:
they are either alike in all respects or have closely resembling characteristics and performances. Irrespective of whether the engine is used as marine main, auxiliary or stationary they are all interchangeable, and all contain the same basic components. All engines consist of the same technology and even though there are differences in size and output, they all serve the same purpose.
C. Normal Value
(8) As the exporters had no domestic sales to unrelated customers (all engines were produced for internal use in their own shipyard in the investigation period) normal value had to be constructed for every basic engine.
The constructed normal values was determined for every basic engine exported by adding cost of production and a reasonable margin of profit. Cost of production was computed on the basis of all costs, both fixed and variable, in the country or origin, of materials and manufacture, plus a reasonable amount for selling, administrative and other general expenses.
Given that there were no domestic sales in the ordinary course of trade on the domestic market nor any other producers of the like product in the same business sector in the country of origin, the profit margin to be added to the cost of production had to be determined on another reasonable basis in accordance with Article 2 (3) (b) (ii) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The Commission therefore based its calculation on the weighted average profit margin realized by the exporters on their profitable export sales to third countries.
D. Export price
(9) The export price for every basic engine in every export order to independent customers was determined on the basis of the prices actually paid or payable.
E. Comparison
(10) In comparing normal value and export price the Commission took account, where appropriate, of differences in conditions and terms of sale and made the necessary adjustments.
All comparisons were made at the 'ex-works' level and on a transaction-by-transaction basis.
F. Margins
(11) The above preliminary examination of the facts shows the existence of dumping in respect of the Finnish and Swedish exporters, the margin of dumping being equal to the amount by which the normal value as established exceeds the price for export to the Community.
Varying margins of dumping were established depending on the type of engines concerned and the importing Member State. The individual margins fluctuated considerably, the weighted average dumping margins for all exports to the Community were established at 11,3 % and 19,6 % for Finland and Sweden respectively.
G. Injury
(12) The volume of imports of diesel engines from Finland and Sweden in the period 1984-87 has increased considerably. Calculated on the basis of number of engines (units) there has been an increase of ( . . . ) (1) whereas the increase on the basis of output (kW) has been ( . . . ) in the same period.
(13) The corresponding market share of the exporters (Finland and Sweden) in the EEC market for medium-speed engines based on total Community consumption increased during the period 1984-87 from ( . . . ) to ( . . . ) (units) and from ( . . . ) to ( . . . ) (kW) respectively.
(14) The Commission established price undercutting by comparing the exporters' prices and those of the Community manufacturers, for every transaction carried out by the exporters from Finland and Sweden during the investigation period.
For this exercise it was first necessary to identify the products which were sold by the Community producers. Subsequently the corresponding ones of the Finnish and Swedish exporters had to be chosen. This was done on the basis of size and output of the various engines as supplied by the exporters. The calculations were made by comparing the average sales prices of every EEC producer to those of the exporters for every type of basic engine. The analysis indicates that the prices at which the dumped products were sold in the Community undercut the prices of Community producers to a varying degree, the weighted average margin of price undercutting being significant and exceeding the dumping margins found.
(15) There has been an overall decrease in sales of Community producers of ( . . . ) on the basis of engines (units) and of ( . . . ) on the basis of output (kW) during the period 1984-87.
(16) Community producers market share during the period 1984-87 decreased from ( . . . ) to ( . . . ) (units) and from ( . . . ) to ( . . . ) (kW) respectively.
(17) With regard to the profit and loss situation of the EC diesel engine producers, it has been established that they suffered heavy financial losses during the period 1984-88.
(18) The Commission has considered whether injury has been caused by other factors such as a decline in demand and low-priced imports from other sources.
For this purpose the Commission took into account that in the wake of the shipbuilding crisis the market for marine diesel engines had witnessed a considerable decline leading to sustained world-wide competition and a decline in sales and prices. Faced with a shrinking market for several years the Community industry implemented stiff restructuring measures which are still proceeding and have led to a certain improvement in capacity utilization. Although the industry is still making considerable losses the streamlining efforts have started to show some positive effects and a reduction of losses seems to be under way. The process was however significantly jeopardized by the increasing presence of low-priced dumped imports from Sweden and Finland.
(19) For the purpose of determination of injury, exports from Finland and Sweden have been cumulated because the engines under consideration were of the same type and the exporters concerned belong to the same holding company, The Finnish and Swedish EEC market shares increased considerably to the detriment of the Community industry; no other serious third-country competitors producing medium-speed diesel engines where found to be selling in the Community during the investigation period. The exporters in Finland and Sweden account for practically all of the total imports of medium-speed engines from non-EEC countries, the market share of other third-country competitors being negligible.
(20) The increased level of dumped imports and in particular their low prices that undercut the already loss-making prices of Community producers contributed significantly to the sharp decrease of sales of Community producers and their considerable loss of market share. The necessity to align their prices also caused heavy additional financial losses to Community producers. The Commission therefore considers that given the already difficult situation of the Community industry, the dumped imports of medium-speed diesel engines from Finland and Sweden taken in isolation are causing material injury to the Community industry.
H. Community interest
(21) In assessing whether it is in the interest of the Community to take measures against dumped imports, the Commission considers that because of the heavy losses suffered by the Community producers the continued existence of this industry is at risk. The production of diesel engines is of social, technological and economic importance for the Community. The European diesel engine industry is an important employer both directly and indirectly through a large number of suppliers of semi-finished and finished products. The number of employees in this segment amounts to ( . . . ), with a turnover of ( . . . ) ecu. The disappearence of this industry would involve considerable social costs for the Community.
The production of diesel engines is also an important factor to the technological development of the diesel industry in general. This technology is continually advancing and progressing. Further plant closures and reductions of diesel engine production would undoubtedly lead to a loss of the technology and know-how involved.
The European importers and users of the products concerned did not make their views known nor raise objections with regard to defensive actions against imports of diesel engines from Finland and Sweden during this anti-dumping proceeding.
In conclusion it is therefore considered that the interests of the Community call for intervention.
I. Undertaking
(22) Following the completion of the preliminary investigation the exporters concerned offered an undertaking concerning export of diesel engines.
The Commission regards this undertaking as acceptable, considering that the effect of this undertaking will be to increase the prices of the products concerned to an extent sufficient to eliminate the margin of dumping found for these exporters. It appears that correct operation of the undertaking can be effecitvely monitored.
In these circumstances, the undertaking offered is considered accpetable and the investigation, therefore, terminated without imposition of anti-dumping duties.","{'title': '90/138/EEC: Commission Decision of 16 March 1990 accepting an undertaking given in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of certain diesel engines originating in Finland and Sweden, and terminating the investigation', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe undertaking offered by OY Waertsilae AB, Helsinki, Finland (acting on behalf of Waertsilae Diesel AB, Trollhaettan, Sweden as well) in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding concerning imports of diesel engines falling under CN codes ex 8408 10 70, ex 8408 10 80, ex 8408 10 90, ex 8408 90 71, ex 8408 90 75, ex 8408 90 99, originating in Sweden and Finland is hereby accepted.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThe investigation in connection with the anti-dumping proceeding referred to in Article 1 is hereby terminated.\n\nDone at Brussels, 16 March 1990.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFrans ANDRIESSEN\n\nVice-President\n\n(1) OJ No L 209, 2. 8. 1988, p. 1.\n\n(2) OJ No C 251, 27. 9. 1988, p. 3.\n\n(1) With regard to injury caused to the Community industry the Commission has received confidential information from the firms involved, which, if published, even in a summarized form, would be likely to have a significantly adverse effect upon these firms.'}]}"

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 of 28 June 2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 1601/92 (Poseican)(1), as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1195/2002(2), and in particular Article 3(6) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 introduces specific supply arrangements for a certain number of agricultural products which are essential in the Canary Islands for human consumption, processing or as agricultural inputs. Among the products intended for feed are lucerne meal and pellets.
(2) Lucerne meal and pellets represent a significant component of Canary Islands livestock feed. However, they are not sufficient to meet in full the protein and fibre requirements in the feed of ruminants, especially in a competitive situation where major efforts are made to produce quality meat and dairy products.
(3) It is appropriate therefore to broaden the scope of the Canary Islands' specific supply arrangements to include long fibre lucerne, which could be incorporated into the protein and fibre diet of Canary Islands ruminants.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(5) Following on from the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001, Part 1 of Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 of 28 December 2001 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions under Council Regulations (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001 and (EC) No 1454/2001(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1365/2002(4), should be amended to include lucerne other than in the form of meal or pellets.
(6) In order to better meet supply needs, soya oilcake, lucerne pellets and other forms of lucerne should be placed in one single group without changing the total quantity.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 should therefore also be amended accordingly.
(8) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the joint meeting of the Management Committees for Dried Fodder, Hops and Oils and Fats,","{'title': 'Commission Regulation (EC) No 1922/2002 of 28 October 2002 amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001 introducing specific measures for certain agricultural products for the Canary Islands and Council Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 establishing the supply balances and Community aid for the outermost regions', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nIn Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1454/2001, the following line is added after the last line but one:\n\n"">TABLE>"".'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nAnnex III to Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 is amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 28 October 2002.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nFranz Fischler\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 198, 21.7.2001, p. 45.\n\n(2) OJ L 174, 4.7.2002, p. 11.\n\n(3) OJ L 8, 11.1.2002, p. 15.\n\n(4) OJ L 198, 27.7.2002, p. 27.\n\nANNEX\n\nPart 1 of Annex III, Canary Islands, to Regulation (EC) No 21/2002 is replaced by the following: ""Part 1\n\nCereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feed; oilseeds, protein crops, dried fodder\n\nForecast supply balance and Community aid for the supply of Community products per calendar year\n\n>TABLE>""'}]}"

Whereas, in accordance with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90, maximum residue limits must be established progressively for all pharmacologically active substances which are used within the Community in veterinary medicinal products intended for administration to food-producing animals;
Whereas maximum residue limits should be established only after the examination within the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products of all the relevant information concerning the safety of residues of the substance concerned for the consumer of foodstuffs of animal origin and the impact of residues on the industrial processing of foodstuffs;
Whereas, in establishing maximum residue limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin, it is necessary to specify the animal species in which residues may be present, the levels which may be present in each of the relevant meat tissues obtained from the treated animal (target tissue) and the nature of the residue which is relevant for the monitoring of residues (marker residue);
Whereas, for the control of residues, as provided for in appropriate Community legislation, maximum residue limits should usually be established for the target tissues of liver or kidney; whereas, however, the liver and kidney are frequently removed from carcases moving in international trade, and maximum residue limits should therefore also always be established for muscle or fat tissues;
Whereas, in the case of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in laying birds, lactating animals or honey bees, maximum residue limits must also be established for eggs, milk or honey;
Whereas enrofloxacin and ivermectin should be inserted into Annex I to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas hyperici oleum, eucalypti aetheroleum, sodium 2-methyl-2-phenoxy-propanoate, nonivamide, nicoboxil, methyl nicotinate, mecillinam, 8-hydroxyquinoline and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether should be inserted into Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90;
Whereas, in order to allow for the completion of scientific studies, the duration of the validity of the provisional maximum residue limits previously defined in Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should be extended for enrofloxacin;
Whereas a period of 60 days should be allowed before the entry into force of this Regulation in order to allow Member States to make any adjustment which may be necessary to the authorisations to place the veterinary medicinal products concerned on the market which have been granted in accordance with Council Directive 81/851/EEC (3), as last amended by Directive 93/40/EEC (4), to take account of the provisions of this Regulation;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 43, 75, 84 and 100 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the European Council has on a number of occasions underlined the need to reinforce and develop further the internal market ; whereas increased efforts are needed to reduce to the minimum the formalities and inspection at internal Community frontiers;
Whereas, on 26 March 1981 (4), the Council approved a priority programme under the common transport policy, concerning the period up to the end of 1983, of which to facilitate the crossing of frontiers was one of 10 priorities ; whereas the Council called upon the Commission to submit proposals on this subject;
Whereas, on 12 June 1978, the Council approved a priority programme for air transport, one priority being facilitation;
Whereas waiting times at frontier crossing-points affect the flow of transport between Member States, lead to an increase in transport costs, which is passed on in the end price of the goods carried, and thus have a negative effect on intra-Community trade;
Whereas waiting times at frontiers may have a negative effect on the working conditions of those employed in the transport sector, in particular in road transport and inland waterway transport;
Whereas these waiting times at frontier crossing-points are caused by transport-related factors and other factors;
Whereas waiting times could be reduced by organizing inspections and formalities and inspections, which are justified under Community law, more efficiently;
Whereas, in order to ensure a smoother flow of means of transport engaged in the carriage of goods between Member States, it is desirable to centralize the various  (1) OJ No C 127, 18.5.1982, p. 6.

Whereas it is advisable that, in intra-Community trade, Member States should carry out inspection by means of spot-checks, except in duly justified circumstances;
Whereas the flow of goods traffic between Member States may be improved by application of the principle of recognition of inspections carried out and of documents drawn up by the competent authorities of another Member State which prove that the goods meet the conditions applicable in the Member State of import or transit;
Whereas it is desirable to attain, through cooperation and concerted effort between the various inspection services and the different types of users, better exchange of information on the various problems which arise at certain frontier crossing-points, in order to seek joint solutions likely to improve the situation at the crossing-points in question;
Whereas a minimum of business hours at frontier posts and appropriate organization of the hours during which inspection services operate may reduce waiting times in traffic passing through;
Whereas the establishment of express lanes reserved for means of transport travelling empty or carrying goods under a customs transit procedure is likely to bring about a reduction in waiting times at the frontier;
Whereas it is also necessary to ensure that Member States do not introduce any new inspections or formalities that would render inoperative the measures taken to facilitate the crossing of frontiers,","{'title': 'Council Directive 83/643/EEC of 1 December 1983 on the facilitation of physical inspections and administrative formalities in respect of the carriage of goods between Member States', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1) and in particular Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas,
(1) Council Decision 2003/18/EC of 19 December 2002 concerning the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Romania, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concessions (2) and Council Decision 2003/286/EC of 8 April 2003 concerning the conclusion of a Protocol adjusting the trade aspects of the Europe Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Bulgaria, of the other part, to take account of the outcome of negotiations between the Parties on new mutual agricultural concession (3), provide for the opening of certain tariff quotas each year, namely for 178 000 live bovine animals weighing not more than 80 kilograms (order number 09.4598) and originating in certain third countries including Bulgaria and Romania, subject to certain conditions set out in the Annexes A(b) of the respective Protocols of these Decisions. Detailed rules of application for this tariff quota were adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1128/1999 of 28 May 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for a tariff quota for calves weighing not more than 80 kilograms originating in certain third countries (4).
(2) To take into account the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, beneficiaries of this tariff quota together with Bulgaria and Romania, and the accession of Cyprus, Malta and Slovenia and pending the results of the negotiations of new tariff concessions for Bulgaria and Romania, it is appropriate to lay down in the detailed rules for the management of this tariff quota that for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2005 the available quantity should be staggered over the year in a suitable manner within the meaning of Article 32(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999.
(3) To take into account the traditional trade patterns between the Community and Bulgaria and Romania, quantities should be fixed for three periods taking into account supplies in the reference period 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003 of live animals originating in Bulgaria and Romania. Once the ongoing negotiations on additional protocols to the respective Europe Agreements with these two countries have been finalised and ratified, new management rules will be implemented at the date of entry into force of the new concessions.
(4) In order to provide a more equal access to the quota while ensuring a commercially viable number of animals per application, each application of import licences should respect a minimum and a maximum number of heads.
(5) With a view to preventing speculation, the quantities available within the quota should be made accessible to operators able to show that they are genuinely engaged in import of a significant scale from third countries. In consideration of this and in order to ensure efficient management, the traders concerned should be required to have imported a minimum of 100 animals during the year 2003 given that a consignment of 100 animals may be considered to be a commercial viable consignment. Operators in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia, should be allowed to apply on the basis of imports from countries which for them were third countries during the year 2003.
(6) If such criteria are to be checked, applications must be presented in the Member State where the importer is entered in a VAT register.
(7) In order to prevent speculation, importers no longer involved in trade in live bovine animals at 1 January 2004 should be denied access to the quota and licences should not be transferable.
(8) Provision should be made for quantities for which licence applications may be requested to be allocated after a period of consideration and, where appropriate, once a uniform percentage reduction has been applied.
(9) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by addition of certain provisions of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (5) and of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6).
(10) Experience shows that a proper management of the quota also requires that the titular holder of the licence is a genuine importer. Therefore, such importer should actively participate in the purchase, transport and import of the animals concerned. Presentation of proof of those activities should thus also be a primary requirement with regard to the licence security.
(11) With a view to ensuring a strict statistical control of the animals imported under the quota, the tolerance referred to in Article 8(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 shall not apply.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 1128/99 should be subsequently repealed and replaced by this Regulation.

Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 of 29 September 2003 on the common organisation of the market in rice (2), and in particular Article 14(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 1784/2003 and Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provide that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of those Regulations and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1785/2003 provides that when refunds are being fixed account must be taken of the existing situation and the future trend with regard to prices and availabilities of cereals, rice and broken rice on the Community market on the one hand and prices for cereals, rice, broken rice and cereal products on the world market on the other. The same Articles provide that it is also important to ensure equilibrium and the natural development of prices and trade on the markets in cereals and rice and, furthermore, to take into account the economic aspect of the proposed exports, and the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market.
(3) Article 2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1518/95 (3) on the import and export system for products processed from cereals and from rice defines the specific criteria to be taken into account when the refund on these products is being calculated.
(4) The refund to be granted in respect of certain processed products should be graduated on the basis of the ash, crude fibre, tegument, protein, fat and starch content of the individual product concerned, this content being a particularly good indicator of the quantity of basic product actually incorporated in the processed product.
(5) There is no need at present to fix an export refund for manioc, other tropical roots and tubers or flours obtained therefrom, given the economic aspect of potential exports and in particular the nature and origin of these products. For certain products processed from cereals, the insignificance of Community participation in world trade makes it unnecessary to fix an export refund at the present time.
(6) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for certain products according to destination.
(7) The refund must be fixed once a month. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(8) Certain processed maize products may undergo a heat treatment following which a refund might be granted that does not correspond to the quality of the product; whereas it should therefore be specified that on these products, containing pregelatinised starch, no export refund is to be granted.
(9) The Management Committee for Cereals has not delivered an opinion within the time limit set by its chairman,",{'header': '26.10.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 282/13'}

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 384/96 of 22 December 1995 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community (1) (the ‘basic Regulation’),
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of 10 January 1997 extending the definitive anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 on bicycles originating in the People's Republic of China to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China, and levying the extended duty on such imports registered under Regulation (EC) No 703/96 (2) (the ‘extending Regulation’),
Having regard to Commission Regulation (EC) No 88/97 of 20 January 1997, on the authorisation of the exemption of imports of certain bicycle parts originating in the People's Republic of China from the extension by Council Regulation (EC) No 71/97 of the anti-dumping duty imposed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2474/93 (3) (the ‘exemption Regulation’), and in particular Article 7 thereof,
After consulting the Advisory Committee,
Whereas:
(1) After the entry into force of the exemption Regulation, a number of bicycle assemblers submitted requests pursuant to Article 3 of that Regulation for exemption from the anti-dumping duty as extended to imports of certain bicycle parts from the People's Republic of China by Regulation (EC) No 71/97 (the ‘extended anti-dumping duty’). The Commission has published in the Official Journal successive lists of bicycle assemblers (4) for which the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty in respect of their imports of essential bicycle parts declared for free circulation was suspended pursuant to Article 5(1) of the exemption Regulation.
(2) Following the publication of a list of parties under examination (5), a period of examination has been selected. This period was defined as from 1 January 2007 to 30 June 2008. A questionnaire was sent to all parties under examination, requesting information on the assembly operations conducted during the relevant period of examination.
A.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS PREVIOUSLY GRANTED
1.   Acceptable requests for exemption
(3) The Commission received from the parties listed in table 1 below all the information required for the determination of the admissibility of their requests. These parties received their suspension after this date. The information provided was examined and verified, where necessary, at the premises of the parties concerned. Based on this information, the Commission found that the requests submitted by the parties listed in table 1 below are admissible pursuant to Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation.

(4) The facts as finally ascertained by the Commission show that for all of these applicants' bicycle assembly operations, the value of the parts originating in the People's Republic of China which were used in their assembly operations was lower than 60 % of the total value of the parts used in these assembly operations, and they, therefore, fall outside the scope of Article 13(2) of the basic Regulation.
(5) For this reason, and in accordance with Article 7(1) of the exemption Regulation, the parties listed in the above table should be exempted from the extended anti-dumping duty.
(6) In accordance with Article 7(2) of the exemption Regulation, the exemption of the parties listed in table 1 from the extended anti-dumping duty should take effect as from the date of receipt of their requests. In addition, their customs debt in respect of the extended anti-dumping duty is to be considered void as from the date of receipt of their requests for exemption.
2.   Unacceptable requests for exemption and withdrawals
(7) The party listed in table 2 below also submitted requests for exemption from the extended anti-dumping duty.

Eusa Mart An der Welle 4, 60322 Frankfurt am Main DE A857
(8) The party did not submit a questionnaire reply.
(9) Since the party listed in table 2 failed to meet the criteria for exemption set by Article 6(2) of the exemption Regulation, the Commission has to reject its requests for exemption, in accordance with Article 7(3) of the Regulation. In the light of this, the suspension of the payment of the extended anti-dumping duty referred to in Article 5 of the exemption Regulation must be lifted and the extended anti-dumping duty must be collected as from the date of receipt of the request submitted by this party.
B.   REQUESTS FOR EXEMPTION FOR WHICH SUSPENSION WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY GRANTED
1.   Admissible requests for exemption for which suspension should be granted
(10) Interested parties are hereby informed of the receipt of a further request for exemption, pursuant to Article 3 of the exemption Regulation, from a party listed in table 3.

(12) With regard to these parties, it should be noted that their requests did not meet the admissibility criteria set out in Article 4(1) of the exemption Regulation as all these applicants use essential bicycle parts for the production or assembly of bicycles in quantities below 300 units per type on a monthly basis.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 11 and 12 thereof,
Having regard to the Commission proposal submitted after consultations within the Advisory Committee, as provided for under the abovementioned Regulation,
Whereas:
A. Provisional action
(1) The Commission, by Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 (2), imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of roller chains for cycles originating in the USSR and the People's Republic of China.
B. Subsequent procedure
(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the USSR exporter and certain importers of the product concerned requested and were granted an opportunity to be heard by the Commission and made submissions making known their views on the duty.
(3) The USSR exporter requested and was granted the opportunity to meet representatives of the complainants for the purpose of presenting its opposing views.
C. Dumping
(4) No new evidence on dumping has been received since the imposition of the provisional duty. The findings on dumping as set out in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 are therefore confirmed.
D. Injury
(5) The USSR exporter argued that injury has also been caused by imports originating in other non-member countries not subject to the anti-dumping investigation and that anti-dumping duties imposed solely on imports from the USSR and the People's Republic of China could not be a remedy but would only shift market shares to other low-price exporters.
(6) The Commission had already considered this factor in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 at paragraph 16. As no fresh evidence regarding injury to the Community industry was received, and in particular no evidence was submitted, that imports from other non-member countries have been sold at lower prices than those from the USSR and the People's Republic of China or have been dumped, the conclusions on injury reached in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 are therefore confirmed.
E. Community interest
(7) One party concerned argued that the introduction of protective measures would not be in the Community's interest because it would make the production of certain bicycles in the Community less competitive.
(8) In view of the negligibly low incidence of a price increase of roller chains for cycles on the cost of bicycle production, the conclusions on Community interest in Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 remain, however, unchanged.
F. Undertaking
(9) The USSR exporter having been informed that the main findings of the preliminary investigation would be confirmed, offered an undertaking which the Commission considered would eliminate the injury found and which was, therefore, considered acceptable.
G. Collection of provisional duties
(10) The amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of roller chains for cycles, originating in the USSR, should be collected in full.
H. Extension of provisional duty
(11) A Chinese exporter accounting for a substantial proportion of the exports of this product to the Community has asked that the provisional anti-dumping duty should be extended for a further two months. He explained that owing to communication problems he needed extra time to supply the Commission with the full information needed to defend his interests.","{'title': ""Council Regulation (EEC) No 3521/85 of 12 December 1985 definitively collecting the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of roller chains for cycles, originating in the USSR, and extending the provisional anti-dumping duty imposed on imports of roller chains for cycles, originating in the People' s Republic of China"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nThe amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty on imports of roller chains for cycles, originating in the USSR, pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 shall be collected definitively.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': ""Article 2\n\nThe povisional anti-dumping duty imposed by Regulation (EEC) No 2317/85 on imports of roller chains for cycles, originating in the People's Republic of China, shall be extended for a period not exceeding two months.""}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Commuities.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 12 December 1985.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nR.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 680/2002(2), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 27(5) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that when refunds on white and raw sugar, undenatured and exported in its unaltered state, are being fixed account must be taken of the situation on the Community and world markets in sugar and in particular of the price and cost factors set out in Article 28 of that Regulation. The same Article provides that the economic aspect of the proposed exports should also be taken into account.
(3) The refund on raw sugar must be fixed in respect of the standard quality. The latter is defined in Annex I, point II, to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Furthermore, this refund should be fixed in accordance with Article 28(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001. Candy sugar is defined in Commission Regulation (EC) No 2135/95 of 7 September 1995 laying down detailed rules of application for the grant of export refunds in the sugar sector(3). The refund thus calculated for sugar containing added flavouring or colouring matter must apply to their sucrose content and, accordingly, be fixed per 1 % of the said content.
(4) The world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets may make it necessary to vary the refund for sugar according to destination.
(5) In special cases, the amount of the refund may be fixed by other legal instruments.
(6) The refund must be fixed every two weeks. It may be altered in the intervening period.
(7) It follows from applying the rules set out above to the present situation on the market in sugar and in particular to quotations or prices for sugar within the Community and on the world market that the refund should be as set out in the Annex hereto.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 does not make provision to continue the compensation system for storage costs from 1 July 2001. This should accordingly be taken into account when fixing the refunds granted when the export occurs after 30 September 2001.

Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3951/92 of 29 December 1992 on the arrangements for imports of certain textile products originating in Taiwan (1) established quantitative limits on the import of certain textile products originating in Taiwan;
Whereas, according to Article 2 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the Union is founded, hereinafter referred to as  the Act of Accession, Regulation (EEC) No 3951/92 and, in particular, the limits set out in Annex II to that Regulation shall be applicable in the acceding countries, subject to their accession and on the date of entry into force of the Act of Accession  relative to these acceding countries; whereas, in conformity with Article 30 and Article 169 of the Act of Accession, and Annex II thereto, the Community innitiations should none the less proceed with the necessary adaptation of Community legislation;
Whereas it is therefore appropriate to adjust the quantitative limits contained in Regulation (EEC) No 3951/92 to take into account the probable accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, and to use for this purpose, in order to take into account the  existing trade flows, the total level of imports of the products concerned in each of the acceding countries during 1993, the last year for which complete statistical data are available, as a basis for adjustment;
Whereas, therefore, subject to the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden and from the date of entry into force to the Act of Accession, the quantitative limits for 1995 set out in Annex II to Regulation (EEC) No 3951/92 should be replaced by the  quantitatives limits indicated in Annex I to this Regulation, which represent an increase equivalent to the actual quantities imported into the acceding countries in 1993, including an appropriate growth rate;

Whereas the technical requirements which motor vehicles must satisfy pursuant to national laws relate inter alia to their front fog lamps;
Whereas those requirements differ from one Member State to another ; whereas it is therefore necessary that all Member States adopt the same requirements either in addition to or in place of their existing rules, in order, in particular, to allow the EEC type-approval procedure which was the subject of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (3), to be introduced in respect of each type of vehicle;
Whereas in Directive 76/756/EEC (4), the Council laid down the common requirements for the installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles and their trailers;
Whereas a harmonized type-approval procedure for front fog lamps makes it possible for each Member State to check compliance with the common construction and testing requirements and to inform the other Member States of its findings by sending a copy of the component type-approval certificate completed for each type of front fog lamp ; whereas the placing of an EEC component type-approval mark on all front fog lamps manufactured in conformity with the approved type obviates any need for technical checks on these front fog lamps in the other Member States:
Whereas it is desirable to take into account the technical requirements adopted by the UN Economic Commission for Europe in its Regulation No 19 (""Uniform provisions concerning the approval of motor vehicle fog lights"") (5), which is annexed to the Agreement of 20 March 1958 concerning the adoption of uniform conditions for approval and reciprocal recognition of approval for motor vehicle equipment and parts;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed (1), and in particular Article 7(3) and Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) On 29 July 2005, Syngenta Seeds S.A.S., on behalf of Syngenta Crop Protection AG, submitted to the competent authorities of the United Kingdom an application, in accordance with Articles 5 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the placing on the market of foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize.
(2) That application also covers the placing on the market of other products containing or consisting of GA21 maize for the same uses as any other maize with the exception of cultivation. Therefore, in accordance with the provision of Articles 5(5) and 17(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, it includes the data and information required by Annexes III and IV to Directive 2001/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC (2) and information and conclusions about the risk assessment carried out in accordance with the principles set out in Annex II to Directive 2001/18/EC.
(3) On 17 April 2007, Syngenta Seeds S.A.S., on behalf of Syngenta Crop Protection AG, submitted to the Commission an application, in accordance with Articles 8(4) and 20(4) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, for the authorisation of existing products produced from GA21 maize (food additives, feed materials and feed additives produced from GA21 maize).
(4) On 2 October 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) gave a single comprehensive favourable opinion for both applications in accordance with Articles 6 and 18 of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and concluded that it is unlikely that the placing on the market of the products containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize as described in the applications (the products) will have adverse effects on human or animal health or the environment (3). In its opinion, EFSA considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.
(5) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.
(6) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.
(7) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms (4).
(8) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.
(9) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(10) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(11) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending directive 2001/18/EC (5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs.
(12) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c), of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms (6).
(13) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman. The Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures.
(14) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. The Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded and that the Commission could finalise the decision-making process.

In its opinion, EFSA considered all specific questions and concerns raised by the Member States in the context of the consultation of the national competent authorities provided for by Articles 6(4) and 18(4) of that Regulation.\n\n((5)) In its opinion, EFSA also concluded that the environmental monitoring plan, consisting of a general surveillance plan, submitted by the applicant is in line with the intended use of the products.\n\n((6)) Taking into account those considerations, authorisation should be granted for the products.\n\n((7)) A unique identifier should be assigned to each GMO as provided for in Commission Regulation (EC) No 65/2004 of 14 January 2004 establishing a system for the development and assignment of unique identifiers for genetically modified organisms(4).\n\n((8)) On the basis of the EFSA opinion, no specific labelling requirements other than those provided for in Articles 13(1) and 25(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 appear to be necessary for the foods, food ingredients, and feed containing, consisting of, or produced from GA21 maize. However, in order to ensure the use of the products within the limits of authorisation provided by this Decision, the labelling of feed containing or consisting of the GMO and other products than food and feed containing or consisting of the GMO for which authorisation is requested should be complemented by a clear indication that the products in question must not be used for cultivation.\n\n((9)) Similarly, the EFSA opinion does not justify the imposition of specific conditions or restrictions for the placing on the market and/or specific conditions or restrictions for the use and handling, including post-market monitoring requirements, or of specific conditions for the protection of particular ecosystems/environment and/or geographical areas, as provided for in point (e) of Articles 6(5) and 18(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n\n((10)) All relevant information on the authorisation of the products should be entered in the Community register of genetically modified food and feed as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.\n\n((11)) Article 4(6) of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending directive 2001/18/EC(5), lays down labelling requirements for products consisting of or containing GMOs.\n\n((12)) This Decision is to be notified through the Biosafety Clearing House to the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity, pursuant to Article 9(1) and Article 15(2)(c), of Regulation (EC) No 1946/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2003 on transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms(6).\n\n((13)) The Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health did not deliver an opinion within the time limit laid down by its Chairman. The Commission therefore submitted to the Council a proposal relating to these measures.\n\n((14)) At its meeting on 18 February 2008, the Council was unable to reach a decision by qualified majority either for or against the proposal. The Council indicated that its proceedings on this file were concluded and that the Commission could finalise the decision-making process.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 108(2) thereof,
Having regard to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, and in particular Article 62(1)(a) thereof,
Having called on interested parties to submit their comments pursuant to the those provisions cited above,
Whereas:
I.   PROCEDURE
(1) By Decision C(2007) 6555 of 19 December 2007 (1), the Commission decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) of the Treaty, in respect of a number of financial flows and transfers to and from Olympic Airways Services and Olympic Airlines and to look into possible State aid granted to both companies since the adoption of Decision C(2005) 2706 of 14 September 2005 (2).
(2) By Decision C(2008) 5073 of 17 September 2008 (3) the Commission partially closed case C61/2007 (ex NN 71/07), finding that Greece had through various acts and omissions granted illegal State aid incompatible with the internal market to Olympic Airlines (OAL) and Olympic Airways Services (OAS).
(3) The Commission found that as regards potential State aid to Olympic Airways Services by way of payments made in respect of a number of arbitral awards (4), further detailed examination was required and accordingly excluded this issue from the scope of its decision. This was left to be dealt with at a later stage.
(4) By Decision C(2008) 5074 (5) of 17 September 2008 the Commission authorised the sale of certain OAL and OAS assets. This decision provided that since OAL and OAS had ceased trading and were to be placed into liquidation their remaining assets would be sold by the liquidator through the liquidation procedure. A Monitoring Trustee was appointed.
(5) By letters of 8 October 2010, 26 July 2011, 12 October 2011, 7 March 2012, 16 November 2012, 7 February 2013, 25 June 2013 and 19 December 2013 the Commission enquired as to the details and progress of the liquidation process.
(6) The Greek authorities replied by letters of 8 November 2010, 11 August 2011, 15 December 2011, 10 July 2012, 4 February 2013, 22 April 2013 and 5 August 2013.
II.   DESCRIPTION
(7) Since 2002 three final negative State aid decisions involving various companies of the Olympic group (Olympic Airways, Olympic Aviation, Olympic Airways Services and Olympic Airlines) (6) identified specific measures granting financial resources exclusively to companies within that group.
(8) By letter dated 25 August 2011 the Greek authorities confirmed that the Athens Court of Appeal had entered OAS and OAL into special liquidation in line with Article 14A of Law 3429/2005, as supplemented by Article 40 of Law 3710/2008.
(9) The Greek authorities have also confirmed that all commercial activities and operations of OAS and OAL ceased during 2009 and ‘Ethniki Kefalaiou’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the National Bank of Greece) had been appointed as liquidator.
(10) In line with Commission Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008, the appointed Monitoring Trustee provided its final report in the context of the privatisation process of OAL and OAS.
(11) According to the information provided by the Greek authorities and the Monitoring Trustee, all essential parts of the sale process, including the setting-up of the new companies and their sale to an investor at market price and the cessation of operations of the old companies have been carried out in compliance with Decision C(2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008.
(12) According to the information provided by the Greek authorities, the liquidation of OAL and OAS is ongoing. There are still some assets left which are unlikely to be easily sold. Once the sale has been completed the registration of the recovery claims will take effect.
III.   CONCLUSION
(13) OAL and OAS have been put into a liquidation procedure and certain key assets have been transferred to different purchasers at market price by way of an open, unconditional and non-discriminatory tender procedure, in compliance with Commission Decision C (2008) 5074 of 17 September 2008. Furthermore, most of OAL and OAS assets have been sold and the few remaining are in the process of being sold. As the entities in liquidation are no longer carrying out an economic activity, it is highly improbable that they will ever resume such activity in the future.
(14) Consequently, an investigation under article 108(2) TFEU of potential State aid to Olympic Airways Services by way of payments made in respect of a number of arbitral awards resulting from actions for damages taken by OAS against the Greek State is unnecessary. The Commission shall not investigate this matter further on the grounds that it lacks useful purpose.
(15) As regards the recovery obligation imposed by Decision C(2008) 5073, the Greek authorities confirmed that the recovery will be effected through the registration of the respective claims in the liquidation procedure of the companies of the Olympic group. In a submission of 16 December 2011, the Greek authorities reported that, once the sale of the remaining assets was finalised, the invitation for creditors to register claims would be published (concerning OAL, this invitation took place in March 2013).

","COUNCIL  REGULATION (EEC) No 1119/86
of 17 April 1986
repealing the definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84 of 23 July 1984 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Articles 7 and 14 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal submitted by the Commission after consultations within the Advisory Committee provided for in that Regulation,
Whereas the following is the case:
A. Definitive action
1. Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2902/85 (3), imposed a definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain and falling within subheadings ex 73.18 B I and ex 73.18 B III of the Common Customs Tariff, corresponding to NIMEXE codes 73.18 ex 13, ex 23, ex 27, ex 28, ex 72 and ex 74.
B. Review
2. In connection with the accession of Spain to the European Communities, the Spanish Government has introduced, with effect from 1 January 1986, a new turnover tax system based on value added (Impuesto sobre el Valor AĂąadido), which replaced the former cascade turnover tax system (Impuesto sobre el TrĂĄfico de las Empresas y Recargos Provinciales).
C. Repeal of definitive countervailing duty
3. It is considered that as a result of the application of the new tax mentioned in paragraph 2, the refund of the indirect taxes on export corresponds to the indirect taxes borne by the product when destined for domestic consumption and therefore does not, in accordance with Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2176/84, constitute a subsidy. Under these circumstances, the definitive countervailing duty is no longer appropriate and, consequently, Regulation (EEC) No 3072/80 should be repealed with effect from 1 January 1986.
4. Under Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 1430/79 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 918/83 (5), importers are entitled to a refund of countervailing duties paid on goods released for free circulation in the Community since 1 January 1986,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EEC) No 1119/86 of 17 April 1986 repealing the definitive countervailing duty on imports of certain seamless tubes of non-alloy steels originating in Spain', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nRegulation (EEC) No 3072/80 is hereby repealed.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.\n\nIt shall apply as from 1 January 1986.\n\nThis Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.\n\nDone at Luxembourg, 17 April 1986.\n\nFor the Council\n\nThe President\n\nE.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 88/407/EEC of 14 June 1988 laying down animal health requirements governing trade and imports into the Community of semen of domestic animals of bovine species(1), and in particular Article 17 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 2003/43/EC amending Directive 88/407/EEC provides that as of 1 January 2005, semen of domestic animals of bovine species must be collected, processed and stored according to the new provisions introduced by Directive 2003/43/EC in order to be eligible to intra-Community trade.
(2) However, it is appropriate to authorise the continuing trade of stocks of semen of domestic animals of bovine species in accordance with the provisions of Directive 88/407/EEC, prior to the modification introduced by Directive 2003/43/EC.
(3) Therefore, Article 2 paragraph 2 of Directive 2003/43/EC provides that:
- up until 31 December 2004, Member States shall authorise intra-community trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of bovine species collected, processed, stored before 31 December 2004 and accompanied by a certificate in accordance with the models provided for before the amendments introduced by Directive 20003/43/EC.
- after this date, Member States shall not authorise intra-community trade in and import of semen of domestic animals of bovine species in accordance with the provisions formerly in force unless it was collected, processed and stored before 31 December 2004. However, the model of certificate applicable to intra-Community trade when taking place after that date has been omitted.
(4) Consequently, it is necessary to provide models of certificate for trade in and imports of semen of domestic animals of bovine species collected, processed and stored before 31 December 2004, carried out as of 1 January 2005. Pursuant to Article 11.2 of the Directive, however, the current models of certificates for imports should be updated in a separate instrument.
(5) With regard to intra-Community trade, and in the interest of clarity, it is necessary to amend the Annex D to Directive 88/407/EEC in order to precise the two different models of certificate applicable for intra-Community trade in bovine semen in accordance with the former or the new provisions of the said Directive.
(6) Although the trade in stocks of semen collected before 31 December 2004 should be transitory and progressively phased out, thus rendering the corresponding model of certificate obsolete, the long lasting stocking capabilities for the product concerned make it impossible at present to fix a date for its deletion.
(7) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health.","{'title': '2004/101/EC: Commission Decision of 6 January 2004 amending Annex D to Directive 88/407/EEC as regards health certificates applying to intra-Community trade in semen of domestic animals of bovine species (Text with EEA relevance) (notified under document number C(2003) 5307)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nAnnex D of Directive 88/407/EEC is replaced by the Annex to this Decision.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision shall apply as of 1 January 2005.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Member States.\n\nDone at Brussels, 6 January 2004.\n\nFor the Commission\n\nDavid Byrne\n\nMember of the Commission\n\n(1) OJ L 194, 22.7.1988, p. 10.

laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products
(Codified version)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 of 5 December 1994 laying down standards for spreadable fats (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 of 2 July 1987 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (2), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 577/97 of 1 April 1997 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products (3) has been substantially amended several times (4). In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 provides that the sales descriptions of the products referred to in Article 1 thereof must be those indicated in the Annex thereto. There are exceptions to that rule. The rule does not apply in particular to designations where the exact nature of the product is clear from traditional usage and/or where the designation is clearly used to describe a characteristic quality of the product. Certain detailed rules should be laid down for the application of that provision.
(3) Article 1(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2991/94, which stipulates that that Regulation is to be applied without prejudice in particular to Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87, must be complied with. The aim of the two Regulations is essentially the same, namely to avoid any confusion in the mind of the consumer as to the true nature to the products in question. Therefore, in order to ensure the consistency of Community legislation, the detailed rules for applying Regulations (EC) No 2991/94 and (EEC) No 1898/87 regarding the use of the designation ‘butter’ should be laid down in a single text.
(4) In order to identify clearly the scope of the derogations referred to in Regulation (EC) No 2991/94, an exhaustive list of the designations concerned should be drawn up, together with a description of the products to which they refer.
(5) The first criterion of the derogation provided for in the first indent of the third subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 relates to the traditional character of a designation. Such traditional character may be considered proven where the designation has been used for a period preceding 9 April 1997, at least equal to the duration usually attributed to a human generation. The derogation must be limited to those products for which the designation has actually been used so that such traditional character is not lost.
(6) The second criterion of the that derogation relates to the use of the designations in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 to describe a characteristic feature of the marketed products. In this case, the exception relates logically to products which are not listed as such in that Annex.
(7) That derogation should be restricted to products which were marketed on 9 April 1997. The Member States forwarded to the Commission, before that date, the list of products which they considered as meeting the criteria of that derogation within their territory.
(8) Commission Decision 88/566/EEC of 28 October 1988 listing the products referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 (5) already contains exceptions with regard to the designation ‘butter’. Account should be taken of them.
(9) In the Community list provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2991/94, the designations of the products in question should be listed only in the Community language in which those designations may be used.
(10) The designations on the labelling of foodstuffs containing products as defined in the Annex to Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 or concentrated products as defined in the second indent of the third subparagraph of Article 2(2) of that Regulation may refer to the corresponding designations given in that Annex, provided that Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (6) is complied with. There is therefore no need for the list of the abovementioned exceptions to mention such foodstuffs.
(11) In view of present technical conditions, any obligation to indicate the exact fat content without any tolerance would involve considerable practical difficulties. Therefore, certain special rules should be laid down in that regard.
(12) Regulations (EC) No 2991/94 and (EEC) No 1898/87 cover composite products of which an essential part is butter. Therefore, those products should be dealt with consistently, whilst adhering to the approach employed in Article 2(3) of Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87. The scope of that paragraph should therefore be defined more clearly with regard to composite products of which an essential part is butter, by laying down an objective criterion for determining whether an essential part of the composite products is actually butter and whether the designation ‘butter’ is therefore justified. A minimum milk-fat content of 75 % in the final product seems to be the most appropriate criterion.
(13) The second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 provides that the sales descriptions listed in the Annex thereto are to be reserved for products which meet the criteria set out in that Annex. Therefore, trade marks which employ those designations may continue to be used in the future solely for products which meet those criteria.
(14) Actual market conditions will show whether or not it will be appropriate to lay down measures at a later date with regard to composite products of which the main ingredient is margarine or composite fats.
(15) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committees concerned,","{'header': '24.4.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 106/24', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 445/2007\nof 23 April 2007\nlaying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products\n(Codified version)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Commission Regulation (EC) No 577/97 of 1 April 1997 laying down certain detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 2991/94 laying down standards for spreadable fats and of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1898/87 on the protection of designations used in the marketing of milk and milk products(3)has been substantially amended several times(4).

COUNCIL DECISION
of 30 January 2007
abrogating Decision 2003/487/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in France
(2007/154/EC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 104(12) thereof,
Having regard to the recommendation from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) By Decision 2003/487/EC (1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, it was decided that an excessive deficit existed in France. The Council noted that the general government deficit was 3,1 % of GDP in 2002, above the 3 % of GDP Treaty reference value, and projected both by the French authorities and the Commission services to be above 3 % in 2003, while the general government gross debt stood at 58,2 % of GDP, and was very likely to breach the 60 % Treaty reference value in 2003.
(2) On 3 June 2003, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (2) (EDP), the Council made a recommendation, based on a recommendation from the Commission, addressed to France with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2004. The recommendation was made public.
(3) In October 2003, the Commission considered that the measures taken by France had been insufficient to comply with the recommendation of 3 June 2003 and recommended that the excessive deficit procedure be stepped up. Instead, on 25 November 2003, the Council adopted conclusions addressing recommendations to France for the correction of the deficit by 2005, which were annulled by the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 July 2004 (3). On 14 December 2004, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council which concluded that 2005 should be considered as the relevant deadline for the correction. It also concluded that actions taken by France until then were broadly consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005, based on an adjustment in cyclically adjusted terms of some 1 % of GDP over 2004 and 2005. On 18 January 2005, the Council concurred with this view.
(4) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.
(5) In accordance with the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (4).
(6) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with Article 8g(1) of Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 following the notification by France before 1 October 2006 and on the Commission services' autumn 2006 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:
— the general government deficit, after rising from 3,2 % of GDP in 2002 to 4,2 % of GDP in 2003, was reduced to 3,7 % of GDP in 2004 and further to 2,9 % of GDP in 2005, which is below the 3 % of GDP deficit reference value,
— over the period 2004 to 2005, the structural adjustment (namely, the improvement in the cyclically adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) reached 1 percentage point of GDP: 0,4 % in 2004 and 0,6 % in 2005. Indeed, although the reduction in the headline deficit in 2005 below the 3 % Treaty reference value benefited from substantial one-off revenues and higher-than-expected tax revenues, the deficit reduction was also driven by a better expenditure control at the State and health-care sector levels. In particular, the annual increase in spending in the health-care sector was drastically reduced compared to previous years as the measures decided as part of the 2004 health-care reform are bearing fruit,
— for 2006, the Commission services' autumn 2006 forecast projects the deficit as being reduced further to 2,7 % of GDP, better than the target set in the January 2006 update of the stability programme (2,9 %). The deficit reduction is expected to be driven by a further fall of the annual spending growth rate in the health-care sector and the continuous expenditure control at State level which is expected to meet its target of zero volume expenditure growth. The recourse to one-offs would be limited to 1/4 % of GDP. The autumn forecast projects for 2007 a further decline in the deficit to 2,6 % of GDP (with a recourse to one-offs limited to 0,05 % of GDP) and 2,2 % of GDP in 2008 (on a no-policy change basis and without one-offs). This indicates that the deficit-to-GDP ratio has been brought below the 3 % of GDP ceiling in a credible and sustainable manner. The improvement in the structural balance (the cyclically adjusted balance net of one-offs) is estimated at 0,5 %, 0,3 % and 0,6 % of GDP in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. This also has to be seen against the progress needed towards the medium-term objective (MTO) of a balanced structural position as set by the French authorities,
— after rising from 58,2 % of GDP in 2002 to 66,6 % of GDP in 2005, breaching the 60 % of GDP Treaty reference value in 2003, the debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 65,4 % of GDP in the second quarter of 2006. According to the Commission services' autumn 2006 forecast, the general government gross debt is expected to fall further to 64,7 % of GDP in 2006 and around 63 % of GDP by 2008 (on a no-policy change basis).
(7) In the view of the Council, the excessive deficit in France has been corrected and Decision 2003/487/EC should therefore be abrogated,","{'header': '8.3.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 68/3', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 30 January 2007\nabrogating Decision 2003/487/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in France\n(2007/154/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) By Decision 2003/487/EC(1), following a recommendation from the Commission in accordance with Article 104(6) of the Treaty, it was decided that an excessive deficit existed in France. The Council noted that the general government deficit was 3,1\xa0% of GDP in 2002, above the 3\xa0% of GDP Treaty reference value, and projected both by the French authorities and the Commission services to be above 3\xa0% in 2003, while the general government gross debt stood at 58,2\xa0% of GDP, and was very likely to breach the 60\xa0% Treaty reference value in 2003.\n\n((2)) On 3 June 2003, in accordance with Article 104(7) of the Treaty and Article 3(4) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure(2)(EDP), the Council made a recommendation, based on a recommendation from the Commission, addressed to France with a view to bringing the excessive deficit situation to an end by 2004. The recommendation was made public.\n\n((3)) In October 2003, the Commission considered that the measures taken by France had been insufficient to comply with the recommendation of 3 June 2003 and recommended that the excessive deficit procedure be stepped up. Instead, on 25 November 2003, the Council adopted conclusions addressing recommendations to France for the correction of the deficit by 2005, which were annulled by the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 13 July 2004(3). On 14 December 2004, the Commission adopted a Communication to the Council which concluded that 2005 should be considered as the relevant deadline for the correction. It also concluded that actions taken by France until then were broadly consistent with a correction of the excessive deficit by 2005, based on an adjustment in cyclically adjusted terms of some 1\xa0% of GDP over 2004 and 2005. On 18 January 2005, the Council concurred with this view.\n\n((4)) In accordance with Article 104(12) of the Treaty, a Council Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit is to be abrogated when the excessive deficit in the Member State concerned has, in the view of the Council, been corrected.\n\n((5)) In accordance with the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty, the Commission provides the data for the implementation of the procedure. As part of the application of this Protocol, Member States are to notify data on government deficits and debt and other associated variables twice a year, namely before 1 April and before 1 October, in accordance with Article 4 of Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community(4).\n\n((6)) Based on data provided by the Commission (Eurostat) in\xa0accordance with Article 8g(1) of Regulation (EC) No\xa03605/93 following the notification by France before 1\xa0October 2006 and on the Commission services' autumn 2006 forecast, the following conclusions are warranted:—the general government deficit, after rising from 3,2\xa0% of GDP in 2002 to 4,2\xa0% of GDP in 2003, was reduced to 3,7\xa0% of GDP in 2004 and further to 2,9\xa0% of GDP in 2005, which is below the 3\xa0% of GDP deficit reference value,—over the period 2004 to 2005, the structural adjustment (namely, the improvement in the cyclically adjusted balance net of one-off and other temporary measures) reached 1 percentage point of GDP: 0,4\xa0% in 2004 and 0,6\xa0% in 2005. Indeed, although the reduction in the headline deficit in 2005 below the 3\xa0% Treaty reference value benefited from substantial one-off revenues and higher-than-expected tax revenues, the deficit reduction was also driven by a better expenditure control at the State and health-care sector levels. In particular, the annual increase in spending in the health-care sector was drastically reduced compared to previous years as the measures decided as part of the 2004 health-care reform are bearing fruit,—for 2006, the Commission services' autumn 2006 forecast projects the deficit as being reduced further to 2,7\xa0% of GDP, better than the target set in the January 2006 update of the stability programme (2,9\xa0%). The deficit reduction is expected to be driven by a further fall of the annual spending growth rate in the health-care sector and the continuous expenditure control at State level which is expected to meet its target of zero volume expenditure growth. The recourse to one-offs would be limited to1/4% of GDP. The autumn forecast projects for 2007 a further decline in the deficit to 2,6\xa0% of GDP (with a recourse to one-offs limited to 0,05\xa0% of GDP) and 2,2\xa0% of GDP in 2008 (on a no-policy change basis and without one-offs). This indicates that the deficit-to-GDP ratio has been brought below the 3\xa0% of GDP ceiling in a credible and sustainable manner. The improvement in the structural balance (the cyclically adjusted balance net of one-offs) is estimated at 0,5\xa0%, 0,3\xa0% and 0,6\xa0% of GDP in 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively.

(2) Histamine and heavy metals have been detected in fishery products imported from Indonesia and intended for human consumption. The presence of these substances in food presents a potential risk for human health.
(3) Council Directive 91/493/EEC of 22 July 1991 laying down the health conditions for the production and the placing on the market of fishery products (3) establishes the sampling and analysis procedure for histamine and the authorised levels for the latter.
(4) Commission Regulation (EC) 466/2001 of 8 March 2001 setting maximum levels for certain contaminants in foodstuffs (4) lays down maximum levels of heavy metals that are permitted in fish.
(5) The results of the latest Community inspection visits to Indonesia have revealed serious shortcomings as regards hygiene in the handling of fishery products. Such shortcomings mean that the fish is not as fresh as it should be and spoils quickly, with attendant high levels of histamine in the relevant species. The inspections have also revealed serious shortcomings in the capacity of the Indonesian authorities to carry out reliable checks of fish, in particular to detect histamine and heavy metals in the relevant species.
(6) Member States should carry out the appropriate checks of fishery products from Indonesia on arrival at the Community border in order to prevent products unfit for human consumption from being placed on the market.
(7) Regulation (EC) 178/2002 sets up the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, which should used to implement the mutual information requirement provided for in Article 22(2) of Directive 97/78/EC. In addition the Member States will keep the Commission informed through periodical reports of all analytical results of official controls carried out in respect of consignments of fishery products from Indonesia.

(1) Pursuant to Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001, production refunds may be granted on the products listed in Article 1(1)(a) and (f) of that Regulation, on syrups listed in Article 1(1)(d) thereof and on chemically pure fructose covered by CN code 1702 50 00 as an intermediate product, that are in one of the situations referred to in Article 23(2) of the Treaty and are used in the manufacture of certain products of the chemical industry.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 of 27 June 2001 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 as regards granting the production refund on certain sugar products used in the chemical industry(3) lays down the rules for determining the production refunds and specifies the chemical products the basic products used in the manufacture of which attract a production refund. Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provide that the production refund applying to raw sugar, sucrose syrups and unprocessed isoglucose is to be derived from the refund fixed for white sugar in accordance with a method of calculation specific to each basic product.
(3) Article 9 of Regulation (EC) No 1265/2001 provides that the production refund on white sugar is to be fixed at monthly intervals commencing on the first day of each month. It may be adjusted in the intervening period where there is a significant change in the prices for sugar on the Community and/or world markets. The application of those provisions results in the production refund fixed in Article 1 of this Regulation for the period shown.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (1) (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Financial Regulation’), and in particular Article 75,

Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 lays down general rules for the performance of official controls to verify compliance with rules aiming, in particular, at preventing, eliminating or reducing to acceptable levels risks to humans and animals and guaranteeing fair practices in feed and food trade and protecting consumer interests. Article 51 of that Regulation provides that the Commission may organise training courses for the staff of the competent authorities of Member States responsible for the official controls referred to in that Regulation, which may be opened to participants from third countries, in particular developing countries. Those courses may include in particular training on Community feed and food law and animal health and animal welfare rules.
(2) Article 2(1)(i) of Council Directive 2000/29/EC on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community provides the legal instrument for organising courses in the field of plant health.
(3) The ‘Better training for safer food’ programme has been established by the Commission in order to achieve the aims set out in Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. The Commission Communication COM(2006) 519 final (6) explores options for future organisation of training.
(4) The 2012 work programme for the implementation of ‘Better training for safer food’ Programme should therefore be adopted.
(5) Commission Decision 2008/544/EC (7) of 20 June 2008 transformed the ‘Executive Agency for the Public Health Programme’ into the ‘Executive Agency for Health and Consumers’ (hereafter ‘the Agency’). Commission Decision C(2008) 4943 of 9 September 2008 delegated to the Agency certain management and programme implementation tasks pertaining to the food safety training measures performed pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 and Directive 2000/29/EC. A subsidy should therefore be granted to the Agency in 2012 for financing the operating costs of the activities related to the ‘Better training for safer food’ programme.

(7) The 2012 work programme being a sufficiently detailed framework, the present decision constitutes a financing decision within the meaning of Article 90(2) and (3) of the Implementing Rules.
(8) For the application of this Decision, it is appropriate to define the term ‘substantial change’, within the meaning of Article 90(4) of the Implementing Rules.
(9) Pursuant to Article 83 of the Financial Regulation, the validation, authorisation and payment of expenditure must be completed within the time limits laid down in the implementing rules. Those rules are also to specify the circumstances in which creditors paid late are entitled to receive default interest charged to the line from which the principal was paid.
(10) This Decision should therefore provide rules on the payment of default interest due for late payments related to actions included in the 2012 work programme,",{'header': '4.5.2012 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | C 129/3'}

(2) Directive 87/328/EEC allows the Commission to adopt in addition to blood group analysis other appropriate methods for the genetic identification of pure-bred males of the bovine species accepted for breeding purposes.
(3) Commission Decision 88/124/EEC of 21 January 1988 laying down the specimen pedigree certificates for the semen and embryos of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species and the particulars to be entered in those certificates(4) requires for certification of bovine semen and embryos of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species details about the blood groups of the donor cow and the fertilising bull.
(4) Commission Decision 96/80/EC of 12 January 1996 laying down the specimen pedigree certificates for the ova of breeding animals of the bovine species and the particulars to be entered on those certificates(5) requires for certification of ova of pure-bred breeding animals of the bovine species details about the blood group of the donor cow.
(5) Analysis of blood groups is no longer the preferred method of genetic identification of animals and genome related methods, in particular DNA analysis, are commonly used.
(6) Therefore, provisions must be made to allow for pedigree certification of pure-bred bovine animals for breeding the use of methods of genetic identification providing scientific guarantees equivalent to blood group analysis.

Elhassan held this position as Western Military Area Commander from November 2004 (approximately) until early 2006. The Panel's information is that Elhassan was responsible for violations of paragraph 7 of UNSCR 1591 (2005) as by virtue of this position he requested (from Khartoum), and authorized as from 29\xa0March 2005, the transfer of military equipment into Darfur without the prior approval of the 1591 Committee. Elhassan himself admitted to the Panel of Experts that aircraft, aircraft engines and other military equipment had been brought into Darfur from other parts of Sudan between 29 March 2005 and December 2005. For example, he informed the Panel that 2 Mi-24 attack helicopters were brought unauthorized into Darfur between 18 and 21\xa0September 2005.There are also reasonable grounds to believe that Elhassan was directly responsible, as Western Military Area Commander, for authorizing offensive military flights in the area around Abu Hamra, 23-24 July 2005 and in the Jebel Moon area of Western Darfur, on 19 November 2005. Mi-24 attack helicopters were involved in both operations and reportedly opened fire on both occasions.

On 28 September 2005, 400 Arab militia attacked the villages of Aro Sharrow (including its IDP camp), Acho, and Gozmena in West Darfur. We also believe that Musa Hilal was present during the attack on Aro Sharrow IDP camp: his son had been killed during the SLA attack on Shareia, so he was now involved in a personal blood feud.

After the attack, Government military weapons and ammunition were looted. The Panel of Experts has information establishing that the attack by SLA soldiers took place and was clearly organized; consequently it was well planned. It is therefore reasonable to assume, as the Panel concluded, that Shant, as the confirmed SLA Commander in the area, must have had knowledge of and approved or ordered the attack.

Whereas, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2784/79, a group of experts composed of representatives of all the Member States met on 14 May 1982 within the framework of the Committee on Duty-Free Arrangements to examine the matter;
Whereas this examination showed that the apparatus in question is a photometer; whereas its objective technical characteristics such as the extension of the measuring field and the use to which it is put make it specially suited to scientific research; whereas, moreover, apparatus of the same kind are principally used for scientific activities; whereas it must therefore be considered to be a scientific apparatus;

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 308 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
(1) Whereas the Luxembourg European Council advocated a substantial increase in pre-accession aid so as to include, in addition to the PHARE programme, aid to agriculture and for structural measures;
(2) Whereas Council Regulation (EC) No 622/98 of 16 March 1998 on assistance to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and in particular on the establishment of Accession Partnerships(3) provides that those partnerships are to comprise a single framework for the priority areas and all available resources for pre-accession assistance;
(3) Whereas Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999(4) set up an agricultural instrument for application mainly in areas such as modernising the structure of agricultural holdings, improving processing and distribution structures, developing inspection activities and rural development;
(4) Whereas the structural instrument created by Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999(5), is intended to finance infrastructure in the transport and environment fields;
(5) Whereas the PHARE programme set up by Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89(6), will in future focus on the essential priorities linked to adoption of the acquis communautaire, i.e. building up the administrative and institutional capacities of the applicant countries and financing investments designed to help them comply with Community law as soon as possible;
(6) Whereas it is important to ensure that Community operations under the three pre-accession instruments achieve optimum economic impact;
(7) Whereas paragraph 17 of the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council on 12 and 13 December 1997 provides that financial support to the countries involved in the enlargement process will be based, in the allocation of aid, on the principle of equal treatment, independently of the time of accession, with particular attention being paid to the countries with the greatest need;
(8) Whereas the above instruments should remain distinct but there must be coordination between operations under them as well as with operations funded by the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Community's other financial instruments and the other international financial institutions;
(9) Whereas it is necessary to provide for reciprocal information and cooperation between the Commission and the candidate countries for on the spot control and verification to ensure efficient protection of the financial interests as well as to combat fraud and other irregularities;
(10) Whereas management of pre-accession assistance should gradually be decentralised to the applicant countries themselves, taking account of their management and financial control capacities, so that they can be more closely involved in the pre-accession aid process;
(11) Whereas the Commission should submit regular reports on pre-accession aid to the applicant countries,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 1266/1999 of 21 June 1999 on coordinating aid to the applicant countries in the framework of the pre-accession strategy and amending Regulation (EEC) No 3906/89', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nCoordination and coherence between assistance granted in the framework of the pre-accession strategy under the agricultural and rural development instrument (hereinafter ""the Agricultural Instrument""), the Structural Instrument and PHARE shall be ensured in accordance with this Regulation.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nMeasures to support agriculture and rural development as set out in Article 2 of the Agricultural Instrument set up by Regulation (EC) No 1268/1999 shall be financed in accordance with the provisions of that Regulation.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\n\nInvestment projects in the following areas shall be financed from the pre-accession aid Structural Instrument set up by Regulation (EC) No 1267/1999 and in accordance with the provisions thereof:\n\n- environmental measures enabling the beneficiary countries to comply with the requirements of Community environmental law and with the objectives of the Accession Partnerships,\n\n- transport infrastructure measures which promote sustainable mobility, and in particular those that constitute projects of common interest based on the criteria of Decision No 1692/96/EC(7) and those which enable the beneficiary countries to comply with the objectives of the Accession Partnerships; this includes interconnection and interoperability of national networks as well as with the trans-European networks together with access to such networks.'}, {'id': '4', 'title': 'Article 4', 'text': 'Article 4\n\n1.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the markets in the sugar sector(1), and in particular the second sentence of the second indent of the first subparagraph of Article 27(11) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(5) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that export refunds in the sugar sector may vary according to destination, where the world market situation or the specific requirements of certain markets make this necessary.
(2) Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1290/2003 of 18 July 2003 on a standing invitation to tender to determine levies and/or refunds on exports of white sugar for the 2003/04 marketing year(2) provides for that differentiation by excluding certain destinations. Moreover, the bi-monthly or monthly setting, as the case may be, of export refunds for white sugar, raw sugar without further processing, syrups and other sugar sector products as provided for in Articles 28 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 excludes those destinations.
(3) The first subparagraph of Article 27(11) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 provides that the refund is to be paid upon proof that the products have been exported from the Community and, in the case of a differentiated refund, the products have reached the destination indicated on the licence or another destination for which a refund has been fixed.
(4) Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products(3) lists the various documents that may constitute proof of the completion of customs formalities in a third country where the refund rate is differentiated according to destination. Under that Article the Commission may decide, in certain specific cases to be determined, that the proof referred to in that Article may be deemed to be furnished by a specific document or in any other way.
(5) In the sugar sector export operations are normally governed by contracts defined as fob on the London futures market. As a result, purchasers accept at that fob stage all the contractual obligations, including proof of completion of customs formalities, without being the direct beneficiaries of the refund to which that proof confers the right. Obtaining that proof for all quantities exported may entail considerable administrative difficulties in certain countries, and this may substantially delay or prevent payment of the refund for all the quantities actually exported.
(6) In view of the impact on the market equilibrium which those administrative difficulties may cause, alternative proofs of destination offering the necessary guarantees should be established.
(7) This being a derogation, its period of application should be restricted.
(8) The difficulties encountered have arisen as a result of the suspension of refunds for exports to western Balkan countries as from 8 March 2003. Under those circumstances, in order to respect the principle of non-discrimination between Community operators and to protect the principle of equal treatment, this Regulation should apply to all the situations which have arisen since 8 March 2003.

Whereas eligibility for premiums should be extended to deliveries of raw tobacco corresponding to production quotas acquired by re-assignment from another producer or by re-allocation of supplementary quota by a Member State; whereas therefore the parties to cultivation contracts should be able to augment the quantitities initially specified therein within the limit of the production quota acquired; whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3478/92 (5), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 163/96, should be amended accordingly;

(1) Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article IX of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (‘WTO Agreement’) set out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning the Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1A or 1B or 1C to the WTO Agreement and their annexes.
(2) The United States was granted a waiver of obligations under paragraph 1 of Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (‘GATT 1994’) on 15 February 1985 for the period from 1 January 1984 to 30 September 1995. On 15 November 1995 the United States was granted a renewal of that waiver to 30 September 2005, and again on 29 May 2009 to 31 December 2014, to the extent necessary to permit the United States to provide duty-free treatment for imports of eligible products originating in beneficiary Central American and Caribbean countries and territories (‘beneficiary countries’) designated pursuant to the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 as amended by the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 and by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008 (‘existing waiver’).
(3) Pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the WTO Agreement, the United States submitted a request to extend the existing waiver to 31 December 2019 and expand the scope of the existing waiver of its obligations under paragraph 1 of Article I of the GATT 1994 to the extent necessary to permit the United States to provide duty-free treatment to eligible products originating in beneficiary countries designated pursuant to the provisions of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983 as amended by the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Expansion Act of 1990 and by the United States-Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2006, the Haitian Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008, and the Haitian Economic Lift Program Act of 2010.
(4) The granting of the United States request for a WTO waiver would not affect negatively either the economy of the Union or the trade relations with the beneficiaries of the waiver. Moreover, the Union generally supports actions to combat poverty and promote stability in the beneficiaries' countries.
(5) It is appropriate, therefore, to establish the position to be taken on behalf of the Union within the WTO General Council to support the waiver request by the United States,","{'header': '6.3.2015 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 62/22', 'title': ""COUNCIL DECISION (EU) 2015/362\nof 2 March 2015\nestablishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization on the United States' request for a WTO waiver to extend and expand the scope of the US Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA)"", 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article IX of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organization (‘WTO Agreement’) set out the procedures for the granting of waivers concerning the Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex 1A or 1B or 1C to the WTO Agreement and their annexes.\n\n((2)) The United States was granted a waiver of obligations under paragraph 1 of Article I of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (‘GATT 1994’) on 15 February 1985 for the period from 1 January 1984 to 30\xa0September 1995.

In accordance with Article 5 of the 2005 Act of Accession (8), Bulgaria and Romania have a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.
(5) The European Central Bank (ECB) was established on 1 July 1998. The European Monetary System has been replaced by an exchange rate mechanism, the setting-up of which was agreed by a resolution of the European Council of 16 June 1997 on the establishment of an exchange-rate mechanism in the third stage of economic and monetary union (9). The procedures for an exchange-rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (ERM II) were laid down in the Agreement of 1 September 1998 between the ECB and the national central banks of the Member States outside the euro area laying down the operating procedures for an exchange rate mechanism in stage three of economic and monetary union (10).
(6) Article 122(2) of the Treaty lays down the procedures for abrogation of the derogation of the Member States concerned. According to that Article, at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. On 27 February 2007, Malta submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment.
(7) National legislation in the Member States, including the statutes of national central banks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Statute of the ESCB). The reports of the Commission and the ECB provide a detailed assessment of the compatibility of the legislation of Malta with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB.
(8) According to Article 1 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the Treaty, the criterion on price stability referred to in the first indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has a price performance that is sustainable and an average rate of inflation, observed over a period of one year before the examination, that does not exceed by more than one and a half percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criterion on price stability, inflation is measured by the harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICPs) defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2494/95 (11). In order to assess the price stability criterion a Member State's inflation is measured by the percentage change in the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices relative to the arithmetic average of 12 monthly indices of the previous period. In the one-year period ending in March 2007, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability were Finland, Poland and Sweden, with inflation rates of, respectively 1,3 %, 1,5 % and 1,6 %. A reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the inflation rates of the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability plus 1,5 percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2007 was 3,0 %.
(9) According to Article 2 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the government budgetary position referred to in the second indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that at the time of the examination the Member State is not the subject of a Council Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty that an excessive deficit exists.
(10) According to Article 3 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on participation in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System referred to in the third indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that a Member State has respected the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System without severe tensions for at least the last two years before the examination. In particular, the Member State must not have devalued its currency's bilateral central rate against any other Member State's currency on its own initiative for the same period. Since 1 January 1999 the ERM II has provided the framework for assessing the fulfilment of the exchange rate criterion. In assessing the fulfilment of this criterion in their reports, the Commission and the ECB have examined the two-year period ending 26 April 2007.
(11) According to Article 4 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the criterion on the convergence of interest rates referred to in the fourth indent of Article 121(1) of the Treaty means that, observed over a period of one year before the examination, a Member State has had an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing Member States in terms of price stability. For the purpose of the criteria on the convergence of interest rates, comparable interest rates on 10-year benchmark government bonds were used. In order to assess the fulfilment of the interest-rate criterion, a reference value calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the nominal long-term interest rates of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability plus two percentage points was considered in the reports of the Commission and the ECB. On this basis, the reference value in the one-year period ending in March 2007 was 6,4 %.
(12) In accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol on the convergence criteria, the statistical data used in the current assessment of the fulfilment of the convergence criteria are to be provided by the Commission. The Commission has provided the necessary data for the preparation of this Decision. The Commission has provided it on the basis of reports submitted by the Member States before 1 April 2007 in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (12).
(13) On the basis of reports presented by the Commission and the ECB on the progress made in the fulfilment by Malta of its obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union, the Commission concludes that:
— the average inflation rate in Malta in the year ending March 2007 stood at 2,2 %, which is below the reference value, and is likely to remain below the reference value in the months ahead,
— the budget deficit in Malta has seen a credible and sustainable reduction to below 3 % of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio has been diminishing towards the reference value of 60 %; the Commission therefore recommended the Council to abrogate the Decision on the existence of an excessive deficit for Malta,
— Malta has been a member of ERM II since 2 May 2005; in the two-year period ending 26 April 2007, the Maltese lira (MTL) has not been subject to severe tensions and Malta has not devalued, on its own initiative, the MTL bilateral central rate against the euro,
— in the year ending March 2007, the long-term interest rate in Malta was on average 4,3 %, which is below the reference value.
(14) By its Decision 2007/464/CE (13), the Council, acting on a recommendation from the Commission, abrogated Decision 2005/186/EC on the existence of an excessive deficit in Malta.
(15) According to Article 122(2) of the Treaty the Council, acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, is to decide which Member States with a derogation fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency and abrogate the derogations of the Member States concerned,","{'header': '18.7.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 186/32', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 10 July 2007\nin accordance with Article 122(2) of the Treaty on the adoption by Malta of the single currency on 1 January 2008\n(2007/504/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU) started on 1 January 1999. The Council, meeting in Brussels on 3 May 1998 in the composition of Heads of State or Government, decided that Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 1999(4).\n\n((2)) The Council decided on 19 June 2000 that Greece fulfilled the necessary conditions for adopting the single currency on 1 January 2001(5).

This notification has not been changed. In accordance with paragraph 1 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark annexed to the Treaty and the Decision taken by the Heads of State or Government in Edinburgh in December 1992, Denmark has notified the Council that it will not participate in the third stage of EMU. Denmark has not requested that the procedure referred to in Article 122(2) of the Treaty be initiated.\n\n((4)) By virtue of Decision 98/317/EC, Sweden has a derogation as defined in Article 122 of the Treaty.

According to that Article, at least once every two years, or at the request of a Member State with a derogation, the Commission and the ECB are to report to the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 121(1) of the Treaty. On 27 February 2007, Malta submitted a formal request for a convergence assessment.\n\n((7)) National legislation in the Member States, including the statutes of national central banks, is to be adapted as necessary with a view to ensuring compatibility with Articles 108 and 109 of the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (hereinafter referred to as the Statute of the ESCB).

of 13 December 2013
amending Decision 2007/198/Euratom establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy and conferring advantages upon it
(2013/791/Euratom)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, and in particular the third and fourth paragraphs of Article 47 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
Whereas:
(1) Council Decision 2007/198/Euratom (1) established the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy (the ‘Joint Undertaking’) to provide the contribution of the European Atomic Energy Community (‘Euratom’) to the ITER International Fusion Energy Organisation and the Broader Approach Activities with Japan as well as to prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a demonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.
(2) Decision 2007/198/Euratom provides for a financial reference amount deemed necessary for the Joint Undertaking together with the indicative total contribution of Euratom towards such amount, which should be made available through the Euratom research and training programmes adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty.
(3) The resources deemed necessary for the Joint Undertaking during the ITER construction phase, covering the 2007-2020 period, amounted to EUR 7 200 000 000 (in 2008 value) in March 2010. In July 2010, the Council capped this amount to EUR 6 600 000 000 (in 2008 value).
(4) The European Parliament and the Council set the maximum level of the Euratom commitments for ITER in the Multiannual Financial Framework for the 2014-2020 period at EUR 2 707 000 000 (in 2011 value).
(5) It is necessary to amend Decision 2007/198/Euratom to allow the financing of the activities of the Joint Undertaking for the 2014-2020 period from the general budget of the European Union and not through the Euratom research and training programmes.
(6) Third countries which have concluded a cooperation agreement with Euratom in the field of nuclear energy research, including controlled nuclear fusion, that associate their respective research programmes with the Euratom programmes are to contribute to the financing of the activities of the Joint Undertaking. Their contribution should be determined in the respective cooperation agreement with Euratom.
(7) The 2012 fusion roadmap developed by national fusion laboratories has the ultimate aim of supporting ITER design and construction and demonstrating electricity production by fusion by around the middle of the century. Therefore, in order to fulfil its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should maintain a close working relationship with the European entities implementing this roadmap.
(8) It is also appropriate to update Decision 2007/198/Euratom as regards the provisions on protection of the Union's financial interests.
(9) It is appropriate to inform the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of Decision 2007/198/Euratom on the basis of information provided by the Joint Undertaking.
(10) Decision 2007/198/Euratom should therefore be amended accordingly,","{'header': '21.12.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 349/100', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 13 December 2013\namending Decision 2007/198/Euratom establishing the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy and conferring advantages upon it\n(2013/791/Euratom)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Council Decision 2007/198/Euratom(1)established the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy (the ‘Joint Undertaking’) to provide the contribution of the European Atomic Energy Community (‘Euratom’) to the ITER International Fusion Energy Organisation and the Broader Approach Activities with Japan as well as to prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a demonstration fusion reactor and related facilities.\n\n((2)) Decision 2007/198/Euratom provides for a financial reference amount deemed necessary for the Joint Undertaking together with the indicative total contribution of Euratom towards such amount, which should be made available through the Euratom research and training programmes adopted pursuant to Article 7 of the Euratom Treaty.\n\n((3)) The resources deemed necessary for the Joint Undertaking during the ITER construction phase, covering the 2007-2020 period, amounted to EUR 7\xa0200\xa0000\xa0000 (in 2008 value) in March 2010.

(3) As part of that administrative assistance, specifically in relation to the transport of beef, veal and pigmeat products bound for the Russian Federation, the information which operators must forward to the competent authorities of the Member States and the system for communicating that information between the competent authorities of the Member States, OLAF and the Russian authorities should be laid down.
(4) That information and the system of communication introduced should make it possible to trace exports of the products concerned to the Russian Federation and, where appropriate, detect cases in which a refund is not due and must be recovered.
(5) Application of the provisions of this Regulation will be evaluated after a significant period of operation. The review carried out on that basis may, where appropriate, lead to their extension to exports of other products and involve financial consequences where obligations are or are not met.
(6) Article 16(4) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/1999 of 15 April 1999 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products (5), specifies that the Commission may provide in certain specific cases for proof of import to be furnished by specific documents or in some other way. Consequently, for the exports provided for by this Regulation, the information from the Russian authorities should be considered a new source of proof supplementing the existing sources of proof.

","COMMISSION DECISION  of 18 September 1991  abolishing the support tariffs applied by the Italian railways to the carriage of bulk ores and products produced and processed in Sicily and Sardinia  (Only the Italian text is authentic)  (91/523/EEC)
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 80 thereof,
Whereas Italy introduced a system of rail support tariffs for certain goods produced in Sicily and Sardinia in the last paragraph of Article 19 of Law No 887 of 22 December 1984 (1985 Finance Law) (1). This states that a 30 % reduction on Italian  railway tariffs shall apply to the carriage of bulk ores from Sicily and Sardinia. A 60 % reduction shall apply to products produced and processed in Sicily and Sardinia. The amount of these reductions shall be borne by the Italian Treasury which shall  reimburse the Italian railways any amount due pursuant to Community law;
Whereas this rule, which is of indefinite duration, is, as far as the Commission knows, still in force;
Whereas the application of support tariffs constitutes a form of aid with a direct impact on the selling price of the goods in question; whereas they favour production of these products vis-Ă -vis competitors in other Member States on the Italian and  other Member States' markets;
Whereas the tariff reductions in question are granted for an indefinite period; whereas such aid does not promote structural development or help to improve the situation in the regions in question; whereas these measures cannot be justified on regional  policy grounds and do not serve the needs of less developed regions; whereas they are hence subject to the prohibition laid down in Article 80 (1) of the EEC Treaty and cannot be exempted therefrom;
Whereas the system of support tariffs introduced by Law No 887 of 22 December 1984 concerns the railways only; whereas, consequently, it creates distortions of competition between modes of transport; whereas this may encourage goods from Sicily and  Sardinia to be carried by the railways which offer a combined rail/ferry service with associated ferries;
Whereas this may have a detrimental impact on the significant charge in the competitive position of the other modes of transport; whereas the Commission has taken note of practical examples of such an effect;
Whereas there is a significant imbalance between the volume of freight to and from Sicily and Sardinia; whereas, consequently, under normal conditions of competition, carriers already find it difficult to obtain return loads; whereas these problems will  only be aggravated by support tariffs;
Whereas such distortions in competition between modes of transport is not in the interest of the public or the completion of the internal market and is contrary to the Community's common transport policy strategy; whereas the prohibition placed on such  tariffs by Article 80 (1) of the EEC Treaty therefore also applies in this case;
Whereas, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 80 (2) of the EEC Treaty, the Commission asked the Italian Government for its comments by letter No 52319 of 7 September 1989 and reminder No 53821 of 18 December 1989;
Whereas by its letter No 57302 of 1 August 1990 the Commission tried to organize a meeting as requested by the Italian authorities;
Whereas by letter No 216 of 15 May 1991 the Italian authorities communicated their comments to the Commission; however, these comments do not give a justification of the support tariffs;
Whereas the Commission has no other information in its possession which would justify authorization,","{'title': '91/523/EEC: Commission Decision of 18 September 1991 abolishing the support tariffs applied by the Italian railways to the carriage of bulk ores and products produced and processed in Sicily and Sardinia (Only the Italian text is authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\nItaly shall abolish the system of support tariffs for the carriage of certain types of goods from Sicily and Sardinia introduced by the last paragraph of Article 19 of Law No 887 of 22 December 1984.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\n\nThis Decision is addressed to the Italian Republic.

laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1254/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in beef and veal (1), and in particular the first subparagraph of Article 32(1) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products (2) (hereinafter the Agreement) which was approved on behalf of the Community by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom provides for tariff-free imports of a quantity of 1 200 tonnes per annum for meat of bovine animals, boneless, dried, falling under CN code ex 0210 20 90.
(2) Due to the BSE crisis the parties declared in the Joint Declaration on the meat sector, included in the Final Act to the Agreement (3) that, by way of an exception, an annual autonomous quota should be opened by the Community for 700 tonnes net weight dried beef subject to ad valorem duty and exempt from the specific duty until the lifting of import restrictions imposed by certain Member States on Switzerland. Commission Regulation (EC) No 2424/1999 of 15 November 1999 laying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 2249/1999 (4) opened an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef for imports from Switzerland on a pluriannual basis for an annual volume of 700 tonnes from 1 July to 30 June of the following year.
(3) At its third meeting held in Brussels on 4 December 2003 the Joint Committee on Agriculture concluded that after the adoption of Decision No 2/2003 of the Joint Veterinary Committee set up by the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products of 25 November 2003 amending Appendices 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11 to Annex 11 to the Agreement (5), and the subsequent lifting of the restrictive measures by the Member States on Switzerland, the concessions as provided for in the Agreement should be applied as soon as possible. However, with consideration to the change in rules of origin, it was jointly felt necessary to allow sufficient time for operators to adjust and to take appropriate steps in relation to possible stocks. Consequently, it was agreed to implement the new concessions as of 1 January 2005.
(4) Detailed rules of application should, therefore, be laid down on a pluriannual basis for a tariff-free import quota of a quantity of 1 200 tonnes per annum starting on 1 January 2005 for meat of bovine animals, boneless, dried, falling under CN code ex 0210 20 90 originating in Switzerland.
(5) To be eligible for the benefit of this tariff quota, the products concerned should originate in Switzerland in conformity with the rules referred to in Article 4 of the Agreement. A precise definition of the eligible products should be provided. For reasons of control, imports under that quota should be subject to the presentation of a certificate of authenticity attesting that the meat corresponds exactly to the eligible definition. It is necessary to establish a model for those certificates and lay down detailed rules for their use.
(6) The arrangements should be managed using import licences. To this end, rules should be laid down on the submission of applications and the information to be given on applications and licences, where necessary by derogation from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1291/2000 of 9 June 2000 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences and advance fixing certificates for agricultural products (6) and from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1445/95 of 26 June 1995 on rules of application for import and export licences in the beef and veal sector and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/80 (7).
(7) In order to ensure proper management of the imports of the products concerned, provisions should be made for import licences to be issued subject to verification, in particular of entries on certificates of authenticity.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 2424/1999 should be repealed.
(9) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Beef and Veal,","{'header': '9.12.2004 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 362/4', 'title': 'COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 2092/2004\nof 8 December 2004\nlaying down detailed rules of application for an import tariff quota of dried boneless beef originating in Switzerland', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) The Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on trade in agricultural products(2)(hereinafter the Agreement) which was approved on behalf of the Community by Decision 2002/309/EC, Euratom provides for tariff-free imports of a quantity of 1\xa0200 tonnesper annumfor meat of bovine animals, boneless, dried, falling under CN code ex\xa00210\xa020\xa090.\n\n((2)) Due to the BSE crisis the parties declared in the Joint Declaration on the meat sector, included in the Final Act to the Agreement(3)that, by way of an exception, an annual autonomous quota should be opened by the Community for 700 tonnes net weight dried beef subject toad valoremduty and exempt from the specific duty until the lifting of import restrictions imposed by certain Member States on Switzerland.

The present list is a harmonised list of wastes. It will be periodically reviewed on the basis of new knowledge and, in particular, of research results, and if necessary revised in accordance with Article 18 of Directive 75/442/EEC. However, the inclusion of a material in the list does not mean that the material is a waste in all circumstances. Materials are considered to be waste only where the definition of waste in Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC is met.\n\n2. Wastes included in the list are subject to the provisions of Directive 75/442/EEC except where Article 2(1)(b) of this Directive applies.\n\n3. The different types of wastes in the list are fully defined by the six-digit code for the waste and the respective two-digit and four-digit chapter headings. This implies that the following steps should be taken to identify a waste in the list.\n\n3.1. Identify the source generating the waste in chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20 and identify the appropriate six-digit code of the waste (excluding codes ending with 99 of these chapters). A specific production unit may need to classify its activities in several chapters. For instance, a car manufacturer may find its wastes listed in chapters 12 (wastes from shaping and surface treatment of metals), 11 (inorganic wastes containing metals from metal treatment and the coating of metals) and 08 (wastes from the use of coatings), depending on the different process steps.\n\nNote: separately collected packaging waste (including mixtures of different packaging materials) shall be classified in 15 01, not in 20 01.\n\n3.2. If no appropriate waste code can be found in chapters 01 to 12 or 17 to 20, the chapters 13, 14 and 15 must be examined to identify the waste.\n\n3.3. If none of these waste codes apply, the waste must be identified according to chapter 16.\n\n3.4. If the waste is not in chapter 16 either, the 99 code (wastes not otherwise specified) must be used in the section of the list corresponding to the activity identified in step one.\n\n4. Any waste marked with an asterisk (*) is considered as a hazardous waste pursuant to Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste, and subject to the provisions of that Directive unless Article 1(5) of that Directive applies.\n\n5. For the purpose of this Decision, ""dangerous substance"" means any substance that has been or will be classified as dangerous in Directive 67/548/EEC and its subsequent amendments; ""heavy metal"" means any compound of antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium(VI), copper, lead, mercury, nickel, selenium, tellurium, thallium and tin, as well as these materials in metallic form, as far as these are classified as dangerous substances.\n\n6. If a waste is identified as hazardous by a specific or general reference to dangerous substances, the waste is hazardous only if the concentrations of those substances are such (i.e. percentage by weight) that the waste presents one or more of the properties listed in Annex III to Council Directive 91/689/EEC. As regards H3 to H8, H10 and H11, Article 2 of this Decision shall apply. For the characteristics H1, H2, H9 and H12 to H14 Article 2 of the present Decision does not provide specifications at present.\n\n7. In line with Directive 1999/45/EC, which states in its preamble that the case of alloys has been considered to need further assessment because the characteristics of alloys are such that it may not be possible accurately to determine their properties using currently available conventional methods, the provisions of Article 2 would not apply to pure metal alloys (not contaminated by dangerous substances). This will be so pending further work that the Commission and Member States have taken the commitment to undertake on the specific approach of the classification of alloys. The waste materials which are specifically enumerated in this list, shall remain classified as at present.\n\n8. The following rules for numbering of the items in the list have been used: For those wastes that were not changed, the code numbers from Commission Decision 94/3/EC have been used. The codes for wastes that were changed have been deleted and remain unused in order to avoid confusion after implementation of the new list. Wastes added have been given a code that has not been used in Commission Decision 94/3/EC and Commission Decision 2000/532/EC.\n\nINDEX\n\nChapters of the list\n\n>TABLE>\n\n>TABLE>""'}]}"

Whereas the structural policies implemented by the Community in the aquaculture sector must have development objectives which are compatible with all Community policies and must contribute to the establishment of the common economic area;
Whereas those objectives must ensure more far-reaching economic and social cohesion while allowing market rules to apply;
Whereas it is more important to create the conditions favourable to development than to make provision for specific measures only;
Whereas steps should be taken to coordinate, in a comprehensive and coherent framework, the operations of the financial instruments both in the Community and in the Member States;
Whereas, in areas where it is being developed, aquaculture interacts with the natural environment; whereas, in certain circumstances, aquaculture may in some cases affect the environment positively and in others negatively;
Whereas Council Directives 91/67/EEC (3), 91/492/EEC (4) and 91/493/EEC (5) harmonize the rules governing animal health and public health as applied to fish farms;
Whereas pressure on space and in particular intense competition regarding the use of the coastline are a major constraint on the development of aquaculture; whereas it is essential, therefore, that preference be given to a policy of identifying sites  which are suitable for the development of aquaculture as an integral part of the landscape and to coastline development projects;
Whereas the future of aquaculture will be determined also by the ability of the industry to increase the range of production by operating experimental farms and pilot projects arising from research;
Whereas on 22 April 1991 the Belgian Government forwarded to the Commission a multiannual guidance programme for aquaculture, hereinafter called 'the programme'; whereas on 7 October 1991 it forwarded the latest additional information concerning the  programme;
Whereas the aim of the programme is to develop alternative forms of fish production and to modernize, stimulate and rationalize existing aquaculture production units in Belgium; whereas the Member State considers that approximately ECU 10 million are  necessary for the completion of the programme; whereas the approval of the programme is without prejudice to any later selection of individual investment projects;
Whereas the programme concerns all the structural policies implemented in the aquaculture sector of the Member State concerned;
Whereas the aquaculture sector is developing within a commercial framework, a feature of which is the growth of international competition; whereas the development of the market in aquaculture species could entail the need to adjust the objectives for  the production of certain species;
Whereas flexible planning is required based on routine monitoring of the factors of production and market conditions; whereas a close watch needs to be kept on the programme, therefore, and this can only be done if reliable figures are available which  are regularly updated and which apply to the national territory as a whole;

concerning the authorisation of choline chloride as a feed additive for all animal species
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition (1), and in particular Article 9(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation. Article 10 of that Regulation provides for the re-evaluation of additives authorised pursuant to Council Directive 70/524/EEC (2).
(2) Choline chloride was authorised without a time limit in accordance with Directive 70/524/EEC as a feed additive for use on all animal species as part of the group ‘Vitamins, pro-vitamins and chemically well-defined substances having similar effect’. That product was subsequently entered in the European Union Register of Feed Additives as an existing product, in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(3) In accordance with Article 10(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 in conjunction with Article 7 thereof, an application was submitted for the re-evaluation of choline chloride, as a feed additive for all animal species, requesting that additive to be classified in the additive category ‘nutritional additives’. That application was accompanied by the particulars and documents required under Article 7(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(4) The European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) concluded in its opinion of 6 September 2011 (3) that, under the proposed conditions of use in feed, choline chloride does not have an adverse effect on animal and consumer health, and it is not expected to pose additional risk for the environment. The Authority also concluded that no safety concerns would arise for users provided that appropriate protective measures are taken. The Authority does not consider that there is a need for specific requirements of post-market monitoring. It also verified the report on the method of analysis of the feed additive in feed submitted by the Reference Laboratory set up by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003.
(5) The assessment of choline chloride shows that the conditions for authorisation, as provided for in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, are satisfied. Accordingly, the use of that substance should be authorised as specified in the Annex to this Regulation.
(6) Since safety reasons do not require the immediate application of the modifications to the conditions of authorisation, it is appropriate to allow a transitional period for the disposal of existing stocks of the additive, premixtures and compound feed containing it, as authorised by Directive 70/524/EEC.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health,","{'header': '22.8.2013 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 224/1', 'title': 'COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING REGULATION (EU) No 795/2013\nof 21 August 2013\nconcerning the authorisation of choline chloride as a feed additive for all animal species\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the authorisation of additives for use in animal nutrition and for the grounds and procedures for granting such authorisation.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1463/2004 (3) authorised that additive for 10 years for use for chickens for fattening, linking the authorisation to the person responsible for putting that additive into circulation. That additive was notified as an existing product on the basis of Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003. Since all the information required under that provision was submitted, that additive was entered into the Community Register of Feed Additives.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 provides for the possibility of modifying the authorisation of an additive further to a request from the holder of the authorisation and an opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (the Authority). The holder of the authorisation of the additive salinomycin sodium (Sacox 120 microGranulate) has submitted an application which proposes changing the conditions of the authorisation by introducing a maximum residue limit (MRL) as evaluated by the Authority.
(3) In its opinion adopted on 30 June 2004 (4), the Authority proposed to establish an MRL of 5 μg/kg for the active substance concerned. It may be necessary to review that MRL in the light of the results of a future evaluation of that active substance by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.

Whereas the Council has not, to date, adopted the prices for the 1985/86 marketing year, in accordance with Article 3 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75; whereas the Commission, in compliance with the tasks entrusted to it by the Treaty, is obliged to adopt the precautionary measures essential to ensure continuity of operation of the common agricultural policy in the cereals sector; whereas these measures are taken as a precaution and without prejudice to the Council's price decisions for the 1985/86 marketing year;
Whereas Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 lays down that, in order not to handicap the producers of early corps in certain southern areas in relation to producers in other areas of the Community, the intervention prices fixed for the new marketing year beginning on 1 August shall apply from 16 May in Greece for barley and from 1 June for the other cereals in that country, and for all cereals in Italy and in certain administrative regions in the south of France;
Whereas the retention, even on a provisional basis, of the intervention prices paid during the 1984/85 marketing year would definitely involve the threat of very heavy sales of cereals from the new crop to intervention in the abovementioned areas of the Community in the light of the possible reduction in the prices that will be adopted for the new marketing year; whereas, in order to avoid the management of the cereals sector being disrupted, the buying-in prices fixed for the 1984/85 marketing year should be reduced as a precautionary and interim measure;
Whereas Article 3a of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 provides for a compulsory reduction in the target and intervention prices where the average actual production of the three most recent marketing years exceeds the guarantee thresholds set; whereas an automatic reduction of the prices in accordance with the provisions of that Article, on the basis of the amount by which the said thresholds were exceeded, would lead to a price reduction that would be excessive as a precautionary measure; whereas, accordingly, in the light of the positions adopted in the Council and in line with the Commission's amended proposal, this reduction should be limited to 1,8 %; whereas such a reduction leaves open the possibility of a later adjustment in the event that the prices are fixed at a higher level; whereas such a reduction should not be applied for durum wheat, since the guarantee threshold for this product has not been exceeded; whereas the price arrangements applied during the 1984/85 marketing year should be retained for the purpose of implementing Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 in respect of this last-mentioned product,","{'title': '85/309/EEC: Commission Decision af 20 June 1985 on precautionary measures with regard to the buying in of cereals in Greece, Italy and certain regions of France (Only the French, Greek and Italian texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\n1.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 62(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2),
Whereas:
(1) In order to prepare accession of new Member States, the Community should take into account specific situations, which may occur as a result of the enlargement and set out the relevant legislation in order to avoid future problems in relation with the crossing of the external border.
(2) Council Regulation (EC) No 693/2003(3) establishes a Facilitated Transit Document (FTD) and Facilitated Rail Transit Document (FRTD) for the case of a specific transit by land of third country nationals who must necessarily cross the territory of one or several Member States in order to travel between two parts of their own country which are not geographically contiguous. Uniform formats for these documents should be established.
(3) These uniform formats should contain all the necessary information and meet high technical standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. The formats should also be suited to use by all Member States and bear universally recognisable harmonised security features which are clearly visible to the naked eye.
(4) Powers to adopt such common standards should be conferred on the Commission, which should be assisted by the Committee established by Article 6 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas(4).
(5) To ensure that the information in question is not divulged more widely than is necessary, it is also essential that each Member State issuing the FTD/FRTD designate a single body for printing the uniform format for FTD/FRTD, while retaining the possibility of changing that body, if necessary. For security reasons, each such Member State should communicate the name of the competent body to the Commission and to the other Member States.
(6) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred to the Commission(5).
(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(8) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis(6), which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement(7).
(9) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(8); the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(10) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis(9); Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.

repealing Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1066/2010 concerning the classification of certain goods in the Combined Nomenclature
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff (1), and in particular Article 9(1)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1066/2010 (2), as amended by Implementing Regulation (EU) No 441/2013 (3), classifies a product consisting of an audio-frequency amplifier and a loudspeaker in a single housing under CN code 8518 40 80 as an audio-frequency electric amplifier.
(2) The Harmonized System (HS) Committee approved during its 52nd Session in September 2013 a classification opinion classifying an identical product in HS subheading 8518 22 as multiple loudspeakers, mounted in the same enclosure.
(3) The EU is, by Council Decision 87/369/EEC of 7 April 1987 (4), a contracting party of the International Convention on the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (known as the Harmonized System or HS), drawn up by the Customs Cooperation Council (known as the World Customs Organisation or WCO).
(4) The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has held that, although the WCO opinions classifying goods in the HS do not have legally binding force, they amount, as regards the classification of those goods in the Combined Nomenclature (CN), to indications which are an important aid to the interpretation of the scope of the various tariff headings of the CN, insofar as they are not contrary to the wording of the respective heading (see, inter alia, the rulings of the CJEU in Cases C-206/03 (5), C-15/05 (6) and C-227/11 (7)).

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 520/92 of 27 February 1992, and in particular Article 6 thereof (1),
Whereas:
(1) An Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters between the European Economic Community, of the one part, and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, of the other part, was signed in Brussels on 16 December 1991.
Safeguard measures may be taken under Articles 24 and 27 (3) (d) of this Interim Agreement.
(2) On 29 July and 3 August 1992 respectively, Germany and Italy requested that the Commission adopt forthwith safeguard measures under the Interim Agreement in respect of imports of steel pipes falling within CN codes 7304 and 7306 originating in  Czechoslovakia.
(3) In their requests the German and Italian authorities claimed that the products in question were being imported in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause:
- serious injury to domestic producers of like or directly competing products,
or
- serious disturbances in the sector concerned or difficulties which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a region.
(4) In support of their claim, the German authorities told the Commission that imports from Czechoslovakia of unwelded steel pipes falling within CN code 7304 totalled 37 377 tonnes during the first four months of 1992, compared with 7 226 tonnes in the  same period of 1991, an increase of 420 %. The result has been an increase in the share of German consumption held by piping from Czechoslovakia from 8,3 to 18%. During the same period, imports of welded pipes falling within CN code 7306 increased by  652 %, from 3 125 to 23 500 tonnes.
Prices for these imports undercut Community market prices by 20 to 30 %.
(5) The German authorities argued that the suddenness and magnitude of this increase in imports, the volumes concerned and the prices charged were seriously disturbing the German market in the products in question.
German pipe manufacturers have recorded an appreciable decline in orders and a fall in output. The amount of unwelded-pipe-making capacity in use has fallen below 50 % in Germany, well below the 75 % regarded as the threshold for profitability in the  sector. A similar situation can be found in the industry producing threaded welded pipe, where business has fallen off seriously. The downward trend has led to an overall worsening in the situation of German pipe producers, who have had to introduce  short-time working, close some production lines and prepare to lay off staff. It is also reflected in the financial results of most of the firms involved, which have registered losses. The adverse impact on German producers of the increase in imports  from Czechoslovakia is compounded by the general tailing-off of economic activity.
(6) The German authorities also argued that without protective measures it was highly probable that the very rapid growth of imports originating in Czechoslovakia would continue and perhaps increase even further owing to the increase in Czechoslovakia's  capacity to export to Germany. This is attributable both to the reduction in Czechoslovakia's domestic consumption and the major decline in orders from its traditional clients in other countries of Eastern Europe, and to the fact that the German  market's geographical location makes it a natural outlet for Czechoslovakia's industry. Such a trend would further aggravate the serious injury to German pipe producers.
(7) In the light of the above the Commission considers that the criteria laid down in Articles 24 and 27 (d) of the Interim Agreement have been met and that it is necessary to adopt forthwith protective measures in respect of pipes falling within CN  codes 7304 and 7306 originating in Czechoslovakia in order to counter the injury caused to German pipe producers. The Commission considers that the imports in question should be limited using the level of imports in 1991 as a reference. This  quantitative limit should, however, be increased by 20 % to allow for a reasonable growth in imports.
(8) The Italian authorities have also provided the Commission with information on trends in imports of the products concerned entering the Italian market from Czechoslovakia. The Commission will closely monitor trends in those imports and, in the light  of its findings, re-examine, if necessary, the situation on the Italian market,","{'title': '92/433/EEC: Commission Decision of 14 August 1992 imposing protective measures in respect of certain steel pipes originating in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and imported into the Federal Republic of Germany (Only the German and Italian texts are authentic)', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.

of 22 January 2004
fixing the rates of refunds applicable to certain products from the sugar sector exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 2001 on the common organisation of the market in sugar(1), as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2196/2003(2), and in particular Article 27(5)(a) and (15),
Whereas:
(1) Article 27(1) and (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 provides that the differences between the prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(1)(a), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex V to that Regulation. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000 of 13 July 2000 laying down common implementing rules for granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds(3), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 740/2003(4), specifies the products for which a rate of refund should be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001.
(2) In accordance with Article 4(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1520/2000, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question must be fixed for each month.
(3) Article 27(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1260/2001 and Article 11 of the Agreement on Agriculture concluded under the Uruguay Round lay down that the export refund for a product contained in a good may not exceed the refund applicable to that product when exported without further processing.
(4) The refunds fixed under this Regulation may be fixed in advance as the market situation over the next few months cannot be established at the moment.
(5) The commitments entered into with regard to refunds which may be granted for the export of agricultural products contained in goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty may be jeopardised by the fixing in advance of high refund rates. It is therefore necessary to take precautionary measures in such situations without, however, preventing the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of a specific refund rate for the advance fixing of refunds is a measure which enables these various objectives to be met.
(6) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1039/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Estonia and the exportation of certain agricultural products to Estonia(5), Council Regulation (EC) No 1086/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Slovenia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Slovenia(6), Council Regulation (EC) No 1087/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Latvia and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Latvia(7), Council Regulation (EC) No 1088/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Lithuania and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Lithuania(8), Council Regulation (EC) No 1089/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Slovak Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Slovak Republic(9) and Council Regulation (EC) No 1090/2003 of 18 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in the Czech Republic and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to the Czech Republic(10) with effect from 1 July 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Estonia, Slovenia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia or the Czech Republic are not eligible for export refunds.
(7) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 999/2003 of 2 June 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the import of certain processed agricultural products originating in Hungary and the export of certain processed agricultural products to Hungary(11), with effect from 1 July 2003, the goods referred to in its Article 1(2) which are exported to Hungary shall not be eligible for export refunds.
(8) In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1890/2003 of 27 October 2003 adopting autonomous and transitional measures concerning the importation of certain processed agricultural products originating in Malta and the exportation of certain processed agricultural products to Malta(12) with effect from 1 November 2003, processed agricultural products not listed in Annex I to the Treaty which are exported to Malta, are not eligible for export refunds.
(9) It is necessary to ensure continuity of strict management taking account of expenditure forecasts and funds available in the budget.

Whereas:
(1) The Commission is required to select, in accordance with Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC, one of two procedures for attesting the conformity of a product. That Article prescribes that the Commission should choose the least onerous possible procedure consistent with safety. It is therefore necessary to decide whether, for a given product or family of products, the existence of a factory production control system under the responsibility of the manufacturer is a necessary and sufficient condition for an attestation of conformity, or whether, for reasons related to compliance with the criteria set out in Article 13(4) of that Directive, the intervention of an approved body is required.
(2) Article 13(4) requires that the procedure thus determined shall be indicated in the mandates and in the technical specifications. It is therefore desirable to identify the products or family of products referred to in the technical specifications.
(3) The two procedures provided for in Article 13(3) of Directive 89/106/EEC are described in detail in Annex III to that Directive. It is therefore necessary to specify clearly the methods by which the two procedures shall be implemented, by reference to Annex III, for each product or family of products, since Annex III gives preference to certain systems.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax (1), and in particular Article 395(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas:
(1) In a letter dated 9 October 2006 and registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 11 October 2006, Italy sought authorisation to introduce measures derogating from the provisions of Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (2), which govern a taxable person's right to deduct VAT paid on purchases and those which require tax to be accounted for on business assets used for private purposes.
(2) Directive 77/388/EEC has been replaced with Directive 2006/112/EC.
(3) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission transmitted, by a letter dated 28 February 2007, to the other Member States the request made by Italy. By a letter dated 21 November 2006, the Commission notified Italy that it had all the information that it considered necessary for appraisal of the request.
(4) Article 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC establishes a taxable person's right to deduct VAT charged on supplies of goods and services received by him for use in his taxable transactions. Article 26(1)(a) of the same Directive contains a requirement to account for VAT when a business asset is put to private use.
(5) The private use of vehicles is difficult to identify accurately and even where it is possible, the mechanism for doing so is often burdensome. Under the requested measures, the amount of VAT on expenditure eligible for deduction in respect of vehicles which are not used entirely for business purposes should, with some exceptions, be set at a flat percentage rate. Based on currently available information, the Italian authorities believe that a rate of 40 % is justifiable. At the same time, to avoid double taxation, the requirement of accounting for VAT on the private use of a vehicle should be suspended where it has been subject to this restriction. These measures can be justified by the need to simplify the procedure for charging VAT and to prevent evasion through incorrect record keeping.
(6) These derogating measures should be limited in time to allow for an evaluation of their effectiveness and of the appropriate percentage, since the proposed percentage is based on initial findings on business use.
(7) On 4 November 2004 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC, now 2006/112/EC, as regards the right to deduct VAT (3). The derogating measures should end at the entry into force of the proposed Directive if earlier than the date specified in this Decision,","{'header': '27.6.2007 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 165/33', 'title': 'COUNCIL DECISION\nof 18 June 2007\nauthorising the Italian Republic to apply measures derogating from Articles 26(1)(a) and 168 of Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of value added tax\n(2007/441/EC)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) In a letter dated 9 October 2006 and registered by the Secretariat-General of the Commission on 11 October 2006, Italy sought authorisation to introduce measures derogating from the provisions of Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment(2), which govern a taxable person's right to deduct VAT paid on purchases and those which require tax to be accounted for on business assets used for private purposes.\n\n((2)) Directive 77/388/EEC has been replaced with Directive 2006/112/EC.\n\n((3)) In accordance with Article 395(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC, the Commission transmitted, by a letter dated 28 February 2007, to the other Member States the request made by Italy.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, which for this purpose consulted the Monetary Committee,
Whereas by Council Decision 76/322/EEC of 15 March 1976 concerning a Community loan in favour of the Italian Republic and of Ireland (2), the Commission has been authorized to conclude, on behalf of the Community, a series of borrowing operations which form a package including, in particular, a variable interest rate loan of US dollars 300 million for five years from a syndicate of banks, as provided for by Article 1 (4) ; whereas this borrowing has been made;
Whereas it is in the interests of both the Community and of the Member States benefiting from the said Decision to change the Community loans from variable to fixed rates of interest;

fixing the rates of the refunds applicable to certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products (1), and in particular Article 31(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 31(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides that the difference between prices in international trade for the products listed in Article 1(a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (g) of that Regulation and prices within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 of 30 June 2005 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 as regards the system of granting export refunds on certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, and the criteria for fixing the amount of such refunds (2), specifies the products for which a rate of refund is to be fixed, to be applied where these products are exported in the form of goods listed in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999.
(3) In accordance with the first paragraph of Article 14 of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005, the rate of the refund per 100 kilograms for each of the basic products in question is to be fixed each month.
(4) However, in the case of certain milk products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex I to the Treaty, there is a danger that, if high refund rates are fixed in advance, the commitments entered into in relation to those refunds may be jeopardised. In order to avert that danger, it is therefore necessary to take appropriate precautionary measures, but without precluding the conclusion of long-term contracts. The fixing of specific refund rates for the advance fixing of refunds in respect of those products should enable those two objectives to be met.
(5) Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 provides that, when the rate of the refund is being fixed, account is to be taken, where appropriate, of production refunds, aids or other measures having equivalent effect applicable in all Member States in accordance with the Regulation on the common organisation of the market in the product in question to the basic products listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1043/2005 or to assimilated products.
(6) Article 12(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 provides for the payment of aid for Community-produced skimmed milk processed into casein if such milk and the casein manufactured from it fulfil certain conditions.
(7) Commission Regulation (EC) No 1898/2005 of 9 November 2005 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 1255/1999 as regards measures for the disposal of cream, butter and concentrated butter (3), lays down that butter and cream at reduced prices should be made available to industries which manufacture certain goods.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 28 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas production in the Community of gasoil is currently insufficient; whereas, consequently, Community supplies of a product of this type currently depends to a considerable extent on imports from third countries; whereas the most urgent Community requirements for the product in question should be met immediately on the most favourable terms; whereas a duty-free Community tariff quota should therefore be opened within the limits of a volume of 3 500 000 tonnes for the period 1 May to 31 December 1990;
Whereas it is in the Community's interests that the gas oil consumed should have a sulphur content as low as possible. In particular, with a view to protecting the environment; whereas, as a result, it would seem appropriate to limit the benefit of the said tariff quota to gas oil of a sulphur content not exceeding 0,2 % by weight;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure for all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the said quota and to ensure the uninterrupted application of the rate laid down for the quota to all imports of the product concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up;
Whereas, it is appropriate to take the necessary measures to ensure efficient Community administration of this tariff quota while offering the Member States the opportunity to draw from the quota volumes the necessary quantities corresponding to actual imports; whereas this method of administration requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is used up and inform the Member States accordingly;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee of the Regions (3),
(1) Whereas, for reasons of the competitiveness of Community businesses, security of supply and protection of the environment, energy matters are an important element in the Community's international activities;
(2) Whereas the Community's accession to the Energy Charter Treaty and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change commits it to continue with international cooperation in the energy field;
(3) Whereas the Council conclusions of 18 November 1992 on the guidelines for cooperation with the developing countries for clean and efficient energy technology stressed that an essential objective of energy cooperation with all developing countries was the implementation of effective energy policies;
(4) Whereas, as stressed in the Council resolution of 8 July 1996 on the White Paper 'An energy policy for the European Union` (4), energy developments in the Community are increasingly influenced by external developments and efforts must therefore be made to ensure that the Community develops a coherent and consistent approach to energy matters with third countries;
(5) Whereas the Community is engaged in international energy activities under various programmes; whereas these activities should be coordinated more closely so as to ensure that they are consistent;
(6) Whereas, in order to ensure that Community aid is used efficiently and duplication of work avoided, the Commission is to ensure that projects are subject to thorough prior appraisal; whereas it will systematically monitor and evaluate the progress and results of supported projects;
(7) Whereas coordination of the Community instruments for international action in the energy sector and other similar international programmes should be reinforced;
(8) Whereas, by reason of their wide-ranging nature, the principal objectives of this programme can be attained best at Community level;
(9) Whereas it is necessary to establish a specific legal instrument for the Community's international cooperation activities in the field of energy policy;
(10) Whereas provision should therefore be made within the multiannual framework programme for actions in the energy sector (1998-2002) adopted by Decision 1999/21/EC, Euratom (5) for a specific programme for reinforcement of international cooperation in the energy field; whereas this specific programme would replace Council Regulation (EC) No 701/97 of 14 April 1997 amending a programme to promote international cooperation in the energy sector - Synergy programme (6);
(11) Whereas, according to the resolution of 8 July 1996, political and trade relations are essential components of energy policy and, accordingly, the Community's international energy cooperation measures should be integrated more effectively in its external policy as a whole;
(12) Whereas the objectives of energy cooperation pursuant to this programme should be to improve the competitiveness of Community businesses, to enhance security of supply, to promote sustainable development and to improve energy efficiency; whereas such cooperation may be put into effect by cooperating in, and co-financing, projects;
(13) Whereas such cooperation should be anchored in an indicative programme and may be the subject of agreements with the States concerned or with international networks of study and research centres;
(14) Whereas, since the cooperation in question is external cooperation, it is governed by the special provisions laid down in Title IX of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (7);
(15) Whereas a financial reference amount, within the meaning of point 2 of the Declaration by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission of 6 March 1995 (8), is included in this Decision for the entire duration of this programme, without thereby affecting the powers of the budgetary authority as they are defined by the Treaty; whereas account should be taken of the fact that a new financial perspective will be negotiated during the course of this programme;

Whereas Protocol No 1 of Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council of 25 February 1998 on the trade arrangements for agricultural products (3), provides the new preferential arrangements applied by the Community to imports of agricultural products originating in Turkey; whereas these preferential arrangements provide for community tariff quotas to be opened for certain products; whereas, following the adoption of these new arrangements by the Council in the beginning of 1998, the future concession of 3 % to be applied to unlimited quantities of hazelnuts or filberts originating in Turkey and imported into the Community, cannot enter into force until 1999; whereas it would therefore be suitable to maintain for imports of hazelnuts or filberts in 1998 the current concession of 0 % within the framework of a tariff quota;
Whereas the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Tunisian Republic, of the other part (4), enters into force on 1 March 1998; whereas this agreement provides that certain products originating in Tunisia can benefit from tariff concessions within the framework of community tariff quotas, when imported into the Community; whereas the volumes of the tariff quotas for some products are increased, between 1 January 1997 and 1 January 2000, in four yearly and equal steps, representing 3 % of these volumes; whereas the increases provided by the Agreement for implementation in 1997 could not take place because of the entry into force of the Agreement on 1 March 1998 and, consequently, the volumes of the tariff quotas applicable in 1998 take account of two increases;
Whereas, as a means of implementing the new concessions provided in the abovementioned Agreements, Regulation (EC) No 1981/94 should be amended; whereas this amendment must also take account of the necessary technical adjustments resulting from amendments of the Combined Nomenclature and of TARIC subdivisions; whereas, since Regulation (EC) No 1981/94 has been amended several times, it seems desirable to incorporate its Annexes I to X in a single regulation;

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Directive 89/662/EEC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market (1), and in particular Article 9(3) thereof,
Having regard to Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (2), and in particular Article 10(3) thereof,
Having regard to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals and amending Council Directive 92/65/EEC (3), and in particular the first paragraph of Article 18 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease in birds, including poultry. Infection with avian influenza viruses in domestic poultry causes two main forms of that disease that are distinguished by their virulence. The low pathogenic form generally only causes mild symptoms, while the highly pathogenic form results in very high mortality rates in most poultry species. That disease may have a severe impact on the profitability of poultry farming.
(2) Avian influenza is mainly found in birds, but under certain circumstances infections can also occur in humans even though the risk is generally very low.
(3) In the event of an outbreak of avian influenza, there is a risk that the disease agent might spread to other poultry holdings and to wild birds. As a result it may spread from one Member State to another Member State and to third countries through trade in live birds or their products and by migration of wild birds.
(4) Council Directive 2005/94/EC of 20 December 2005 on Community measures for the control of avian influenza and repealing Directive 92/40/EEC (4) sets out measures for the control of both the low pathogenic and highly pathogenic forms of avian influenza. Article 16 of that Directive provides for the establishment of protection, surveillance and further restricted zones in the event of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza.
(5) Commission Decision 2006/415/EC of 14 June 2006 concerning certain protection measures in relation to highly pathogenic avian influenza of the subtype H5N1 in poultry in the Community and repealing Decision 2006/135/EC (5) lays down additional protection measures to be applied in a Member State affected by the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of the H5N1 subtype in order to prevent the spread of that disease, taking into account the specific epidemiology of that particular virus strain.
(6) Article 4 of Decision 2006/415/EC requires that Member States immediately following a suspected or confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 establish a high risk area consisting of protection and surveillance zones (area A) and a low risk area separating area A from the disease-free parts of the affected Member State (area B). Those areas are listed in the Annex to that Decision.
(7) Germany has notified the Commission of a confirmed outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza of subtype H5N1 on its territory and has taken the appropriate measures as provided for in Decision 2006/415/EC, including the establishment of areas A and B.
(8) The Commission has now examined those protection measures in collaboration with Germany, and is satisfied that the borders of areas A and B established by the competent authority in that Member State are at a sufficient distance to the actual location of the confirmed outbreak.
(9) In order to prevent any unnecessary disturbance to intra-community trade and to avoid the adoption of unjustified barriers to trade by third countries, it is necessary to promptly establish a list of the areas A and B in Germany at Community level.
(10) Accordingly, pending the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, areas A and B in Germany, where the protection measures laid down in Decision 2006/415/EC are to apply, should be listed in the present Decision and the duration of that regionalisation fixed.

Whereas:
(1) Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 of 3 April 2001 on special market support measures in the beef sector(3) lays down in its Article 1 the eligibility criteria to be met for carcasses in order to be accepted under the purchase scheme. The last indent of Article 1(2) provides in particular for the carcasses to be appropriately labelled. As labelling, however, serves no purpose where the meat is intended for destruction after take-over, derogation from this requirement should be provided in such circumstances.
(2) Article 3(1) and (2) of Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 provides for an amount of EUR 14 per 100 kg to be taken into account when fixing the maximum buying-in price. The experience from the application of the Regulation indicates that that amount is insufficient to cover the net slaughter costs as intended, in particular due to a low value of by-products. The amount should therefore be increased to EUR 18 per 100 kg.
(3) Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 690/2001 lays down that the price to be paid to the successful tenderer shall be adjusted where carcasses taken over differ from the classification class O. The application of that provision has led to artificially high prices for meat from Category B animals offered under the scheme. An appropriate amendment should therefore be provided.

Whereas, in view of their climatic conditions, barley production in Finland and Sweden is predominantly of six-row varieties due to their shorter growing period in comparison to two-row varieties; whereas the kernel size of six-row barley in these countries is under 2,2 millimetres; whereas the barley does not therefore meet the intervention quality requirements on kernel size; whereas the immediate application of the Community rules would be likely to lead to a risk of large quantities of barley being excluded from intervention in Finland and Sweden; whereas this would consequently give rise to substantial difficulties for Finnish and Swedish producers; whereas it is therefore necessary temporarily to authorize Finland and Sweden to accept barley with a kernel size of under 2,2 millimetres into intervention; whereas the acceptance of a lower kernel size should not lead to barley of an inferior quality being accepted into intervention; whereas, therefore, the barley concerned should be required to meet a higher specific weight of at least 64 kg/hl;

(1) Under Directive 70/524/EEC the additive canthaxanthin is authorised under certain conditions.
(2) In 1997 the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) concluded the acceptable daily intake (ADI) of canthaxanthin for humans could be set at 0,03 mg/kg of body weight.
(3) In the light of the SCF's revision of the ADI, the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition (SCAN) reviewed levels of canthaxanthin in feed for salmonids, broilers and laying hens to ensure consumer safety. SCAN has stated that consumer safety would be assured by setting maximum canthaxanthin concentrations of 25 mg/kg of feed for salmonids and broilers and at 8 mg/kg of feed for laying hens.

Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) No 528/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2012 concerning the making available on the market and use of biocidal products (1), and in particular Article 90(2) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) The United Kingdom has received on 17 July 2007 an application, in accordance with Article 11(1) of Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (2), for the inclusion of the active substance tralopyril in its Annex I for use in product-type 21, antifouling products, as defined in Annex V to that Directive.
(2) Tralopyril was not on the market on 14 May 2000 as an active substance of a biocidal product.
(3) The United Kingdom submitted the assessment report, together with its recommendations, to the Commission on 1 September 2009 in accordance with Article 11(2) of Directive 98/8/EC.
(4) The opinion of the European Chemicals Agency was formulated on 8 April 2014 by the Biocidal Product Committee, having regard to the conclusions of the evaluating competent authority.
(5) It appears from that opinion that biocidal products used for product-type 21 and containing tralopyril may be expected to satisfy the requirements laid down in Article 5 of Directive 98/8/EC provided that certain specifications and conditions relating to its use are satisfied.
(6) It is therefore appropriate to approve tralopyril for use in biocidal products for product-type 21 subject to compliance with certain specifications and conditions.
(7) Since the evaluations did not address nanomaterials, the approvals should not cover such materials pursuant to Article 4(4) of Regulation (EU) No 528/2012.
(8) A reasonable period should be allowed to elapse before an active substance is approved, in order to permit interested parties to take the preparatory measures necessary to meet the new requirements laid down.

Whereas the growing problems of road and rail saturation, transport safety, environment, energy saving and quality of life of the citizen call, in the public interest, for greater development and better use of the transport potential offered by inland waterway, in particular by improving its competitiveness;
Whereas the difference in national laws on the systems for the commercial operation of inland waterway transport, does not make for the smooth functioning of the internal market in this sector; whereas, therefore, common provisions should be introduced at Community level for the whole of the inland waterways market, in accordance with the Council Resolution of 24 October 1994 on structural improvements in inland waterway transport (4);
Whereas the smooth functioning of the internal market calls for an adjustment in inland waterways transport to the organization of chartering by rotation, so as to move towards greater commercial flexibility and a system of freedom of chartering and pricing;
Whereas, to this end provision should be made for a transitional period, the scope of the rotation system being gradually limited for carriers to adapt to the conditions of a free market and, where appropriate, to set up trade groupings better suited to the logistical needs of shippers;
Whereas, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it is both necessary and adequate to set a uniform timetable at Community level for the gradual liberalization of the market, while leaving with the Member States the responsibility for putting such liberalization into effect;
Whereas provisions must be adopted to allow action to be taken on the transport market in question in the event of a serious disturbance; whereas, to this end, the Commission should be given the power to take appropriate measures, in accordance with the procedure of an advisory committee,","{'title': 'Council Directive 96/75/EC of 19 November 1996 on the systems of chartering and pricing in national and international inland waterway transport in the Community', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': ""Article 1\n\nFor the purposes of this Directive:\n\n(a) 'system of chartering by rotation` shall mean a system which consists of allocating in a charter exchange requests for transport operations, at previously fixed prices and under conditions made known, from customers on the basis of the order in which vessels become available after unloading.

fixing the export refunds on cereal-based compound feedingstuffs
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals(1), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 1666/2000(2), and in particular Article 13(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Article 13 of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 provides that the difference between quotations or prices on the world market for the products listed in Article 1 of that Regulation and prices for those products within the Community may be covered by an export refund.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1517/95 of 29 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 as regards the arrangements for the export and import of compound feedingstuffs based on cereals and amending Regulation (EC) No 1162/95 laying down special detailed rules for the application of the system of import and export licences for cereals and rice(3) in Article 2 lays down general rules for fixing the amount of such refunds.
(3) That calculation must also take account of the cereal products content. In the interest of simplification, the refund should be paid in respect of two categories of ""cereal products"", namely for maize, the most commonly used cereal in exported compound feeds and maize products, and for ""other cereals"", these being eligible cereal products excluding maize and maize products. A refund should be granted in respect of the quantity of cereal products present in the compound feedingstuff.
(4) Furthermore, the amount of the refund must also take into account the possibilities and conditions for the sale of those products on the world market, the need to avoid disturbances on the Community market and the economic aspect of the export.

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN  UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 113  thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 2 of Annex I to the Agreement establishing an association between the European  Community and Malta  (1), as supplemented by the Additional Protocol  (2), the Supplementary  Protocol to the Agreement  (3) and the Protocol extending the first stage of this Agreement  (4),  exempts from duties, subject to tariff ceilings, certain products falling within Chapters 52 to 63  of the combined nomenclature and originating in Malta;
Whereas the Additional Protocols to the Agreements between the European Community, of the one part,  and Cyprus  (5), Egypt  (6), Jordan  (7), Israel  (8), Tunisia  (9), Syria  (10), Malta and Morocco   (11), of the other part, provide for the progressive reduction, subject to reference quantities  and to statistical Community surveillance, of the customs duties applicable to certain agricultural  products originating in those countries according to set timetables;
Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 1134/91 of 29 April 1991 on the tariff arrangements, applicable  to imports into the Community of products originating in the Occupied Territories  (12) provides  for the elimination on 1 January 1993, according to a set timetable, of customs duties on products  listed in Annex II thereto and originating in these territories, and that certain of these products  should be subject to reference quantities;
Whereas, by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1764/92 of 29 June 1992 amending the arrangements for the  import into the Community of certain agricultural products originating in Cyprus, Egypt, Israel,  Jordan, Malta, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia  (13), the Community unilaterally increased the amount of  the above reference quantities in equal tranches of 3  % or 5  % per year starting on 1 January  1992;
Whereas the abovementioned Agreements and Regulation (EEC) No 1134/91 are of indeterminate  duration; whereas the Agreements and the abovementioned Regulation (EEC) No 1764/92 lay down the  rates for the annual increases in the tariff ceilings and reference quantities; whereas, therefore,  the tariff measures in question should likewise be of indeterminate duration; whereas the  application of these measures should be rationalized by grouping them together in a single  regulation;
Whereas the tariff measures provided for in this Regulation should now be opened; whereas the scope  and period of application of each of those measures are set out in the Annexes; whereas, in view of  the negotiations under way for the renewal of some of the agreements in question, the period of  validity of the measures set out in the Annexes to this Regulation should be limited to 31 December  1996;
Whereas amendments to the combined nomenclature and Taric codes, and the extension under the  present Agreements of the tariff measures in question, require no changes of substance; whereas, in  the interests of simplification and without prejudice to the specific procedures laid down by  Council Regulation (EC) No 3448/93 of 6 December 1993 laying down the trade arrangements applicable  to certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products  (14), provision should be  made for the Commission to make the necessary amendments and technical adaptations to this  Regulation after first having obtained the opinion of the Customs Code Committee;
Whereas the decision to establish tariff ceilings and reference quantities should be taken by the  Community; whereas it is also for the Community to establish the relevant surveillance systems for  these two tariff measures;
Whereas customs duties suspended within the limits of tariff ceilings may be re-established once  those limits have been reached at Community level; whereas the application of ceilings calls for a  system of surveillance that enables the Commission to be kept abreast of the trend in imports of  products subject to such measures;
Whereas the administration of the tariff ceilings requires close and particularly rapid cooperation  between the Member States and the Commission, and the latter must in particular be able to follow  the progress of quantities charged against the ceilings and keep the Member States informed;  whereas this cooperation has to be all the more close because the Commission has to be able to take  appropriate action whenever a ceiling is reached; whereas, to ensure the efficiency of this  surveillance system, Member States must charge imports of the products in question agianst the  ceilings as and when the products are entered with customs for free circulation;
Whereas, as regards the products subject to reference quantities, Regulation (EEC) No 451/89  (1)  establishes procedures for modifying the statuts of these products by submitting them, if  necessary, to tariff quotas; whereas Article 3 (2) of the Regulation provides for a system of  surveillance; whereas such surveillance must notably enable the Commission to draw up an annual  trade balance sheet for each of the products concerned,","{'title': 'Council Regulation (EC) No 934/95 of 10 April 1995 establishing tariff ceilings and a Community statistical surveillance in the framework of reference quantities for a certain number of products originating in Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, Tunisia, Syria, Malta, Morocco and the Occupied Territories', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\n\n1.
