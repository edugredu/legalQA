COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/980
of 14 March 2019
supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the format, content, scrutiny and approval of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC (1), and in particular Article 9(14), paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 13, Articles 14(3), 15(2) and 20(11) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 lays down requirements to be complied with when drawing up prospectuses. The requirements concerning the scrutiny, review, approval and filing of the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, the requirements concerning the format of the prospectus, the base prospectus and the final terms, the specific information to be included in a prospectus, the minimum information to be included in the universal registration document, the reduced information to be included under the simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances, the reduced content, the standardised format and the sequence of the EU Growth prospectus, the reduced content and standardised format of the specific summary and the scrutiny and approval of prospectuses all need to be specified.
(2)
The content and the format of a prospectus depend on a variety of factors, such as the type of issuer, type of security, type of issuance as well as the possible involvement of a third party as a guarantor and the question of whether or not there is an admission to trading. It is therefore not appropriate to lay down the same requirements for all types of prospectuses. Specific information requirements should be laid down instead and should be combined depending on those factors and the type of prospectus. This should however not prevent an issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to provide in the prospectus the most comprehensive information available.
(3)
To ensure legal certainty and increase transparency for investors, issuers should state in their universal registration document whether the universal registration document has been approved by the competent authority or merely has been filed and published without prior approval.
(4)
The alleviated information requirements for secondary issuances should reflect the specificities of equity and non-equity securities.
(5)
Collective investment undertakings of the close-end type pursue specific investment objectives and might be subject to specific investment restrictions. The registration documents for those undertakings should therefore be subject to specific information requirements.
(6)
Due to the indirect link between the investor and the underlying shares of depository receipts, it is important that the investor is informed about the issuer of the underlying shares. The prospectus for depository receipts should therefore contain, apart from information about the depositary receipt and the issuer of the depository receipt, information about the underlying shares and the issuer of those underlying shares.
(7)
The information contained in prospectuses for non-equity securities should be adapted to the level of knowledge and expertise of each type of investor. Prospectuses for non-equity securities in which retail investors can invest should therefore be subject to more comprehensive and distinct information requirements than prospectuses for non-equity securities that are reserved to qualified investors.
(8)
The obligation to produce a prospectus applies to non-equity securities issued by third countries and their regional and local authorities in cases where those entities wish to make a public offer of securities in the Union or wish their securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market. Due to the particular nature of those public entities, specific information requirements should be laid down.
(9)
Investors should be able to understand the situation of an issuer with a complex financial history and the expected effects of a transaction involving a significant financial commitment. Those issuers should therefore be required to include additional information in the prospectus to that effect.
(10)
Where securities are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are already admitted to trading on a regulated market, shareholders and investors normally already have the information about the underlying shares of those securities. It is therefore sufficient to add to the prospectus a statement setting out the type of the underlying share and details of where information about the underlying share can be obtained.
(11)
Investors may want to invest in securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are or will be issued by the issuer of those securities or by an entity belonging to that issuer’s group and that have not yet been admitted to trading on a regulated market. Those investors should have the same information about the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue its operations and about its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as investors that have invested in those shares directly. The prospectus should therefore contain a working capital statement as well as a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares.
(12)
Derivative securities entail particular risks for investors because, for instance, the losses might be higher than the investment made and because the underlying is not always admitted to trading on a regulated market and information about that underlying might therefore not be available. Some non-equity securities, such as structured bonds, also incorporate certain elements of a derivative security. Consequently, the securities note should contain additional information about the underlying of a derivative security or about the derivative component of the non-equity security and, where applicable, a statement about the potential losses that investors might face.
(13)
Where a base prospectus is drawn up for securities linked to or backed by an underlying asset, that base prospectus should contain all information about the type of underlying asset where that underlying asset is known at the date of approval of the base prospectus. Market conditions may however change the choice of the underlying asset within a category of underlying assets. Only the final terms of the base prospectus should therefore contain specific details about that underlying asset.
(14)
Guarantees are intended to ensure that the payments related to the security are duly serviced. Given the potential diversity in guarantees, clear information requirements related to the nature and the scope of those guarantees should be laid down.
(15)
The format of the prospectus, base prospectus and final terms should be specified by determining the order in which the required information should be disclosed. However, due to the multipurpose character of the universal registration document, issuers who choose to draw up and publish a universal registration document every financial year should be granted more flexibility as regards the order of information to be provided in the universal registration document.
(16)
Whilst the base prospectus should contain all information available at the time of drawing up that base prospectus, it should be possible to leave blanks as regards specific information that only becomes available at a later stage and is to be found in the final terms, or to include a list of that missing information.
(17)
It is not always required to include a summary into the prospectus. That should however not prevent the insertion of an overview section into the prospectus. To avoid confusion among investors, such overview section should however not be called a summary, unless it complies with all the requirements for summaries.
(18)
The EU growth prospectus is intended to alleviate the administrative burden, in particular for SMEs. It is therefore appropriate to simplify the drafting of EU growth prospectuses by laying down a fixed order in which the information should be presented. However, to ensure that information is presented in a manner that is coherent and consistent with the different business models, flexibility should be allowed as regards the order of information items within each section of the EU growth prospectus.
(19)
To allow for flexibility and to encourage the use of the EU growth prospectus, it should be possible that the EU growth prospectus is composed of separate documents. To avoid the risk of duplicating information, separate detailed information requirements for the specific registration document on the one hand and for the specific securities note on the other should be laid down and adapted to the type of securities concerned, differentiating between equity and non-equity securities.
(20)
The specific summary of the EU Growth prospectus should provide investors with key information needed to decide which offers of securities they want to study further by reviewing the prospectus as a whole. It should therefore convey the essential characteristics of, and risks associated with, the issuer and the securities offered and contain the general terms and conditions of the offer. However, given that the specific summary is only an introduction to the EU Growth prospectus and must be read together with the other parts thereof, the content of the specific summary should be consistent with those other parts. To ensure that the size of the specific summary is tailored to the reduced size of the EU Growth prospectus, the length of the summary should be restricted.
(21)
To ensure that competent authorities apply harmonised standards across the Union when scrutinising prospectuses, and in particular the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the information contained in draft prospectuses, criteria for prospectus scrutiny should be laid down. Those criteria should be applied for the entire draft prospectus and any of its constituent parts, including the universal registration document and any amendments and supplements to the prospectus.
(22)
A high level of investor protection should be ensured. Competent authorities should therefore be allowed to consider, where necessary, additional criteria for the scrutiny of the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of draft prospectuses in order to adapt that scrutiny to the specific characteristics of a prospectus.
(23)
Some issuers are involved into very specific business activities that require a profound knowledge of the activities concerned to have a full understanding of the securities issued by those issuers. That would apply for example in the case of a property company that could be required to disclose a valuation report providing all relevant details in respect of material properties necessary for the purposes of the valuation. Competent authorities should therefore be able to take a proportionate approach and require, where appropriate, that those specialist issuers include in the prospectus specific and adapted information about those activities that goes beyond the information required from non-specialist issuers.
(24)
Due to the rapid evolution of securities markets, there is the possibility that certain types of securities that are not covered by the Annexes to this Regulation will be offered to the public or admitted to trading. In such a case, to enable investors to make an informed investment decision, competent authorities should decide in consultation with the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market which information should be included in the prospectus.
(25)
To drive efficiency in the process of drawing up the prospectus and eliminate unnecessary burdens, it is appropriate to allow the omission of information items set out in the Annexes to this Regulation that are not pertinent to the issuer or to the securities being offered or admitted to trading on a regulated market.
(26)
Scrutiny and approval of prospectuses is an iterative process. As such, the decision of the competent authority to approve the draft prospectus may involve several rounds of analysis of the draft prospectus and ensuing improvements by the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to ensure that the draft prospectus meets the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency. To provide certainty about the approval process, it is necessary to specify which documents should be provided to competent authorities at the different stages of the approval process.
(27)
For reasons of efficiency, competent authorities should be permitted to carry out a lighter scrutiny where a draft prospectus replicates information that has already been scrutinised or reviewed.
(28)
To enable competent authorities to search for specific terms or words in submitted documents and thus to ensure an efficient and timely scrutiny process of the prospectuses, draft prospectuses and accompanying information should be submitted in searchable electronic format and through electronic means acceptable to the competent authority.
(29)
Issuers, offerors or persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market should be able to demonstrate to the competent authority how they addressed issues notified by that authority. Each draft of the prospectus submitted to the competent authority, with the exception of the first draft, should therefore contain both a marked-up version that clearly highlights all changes made to the previously submitted draft, and a clean version where such changes are not highlighted.
(30)
To minimise delays in the scrutiny process, competent authorities should be able to identify quickly information requirements that are not applicable or not relevant. For that purpose, the competent authorities should be informed about the information that has not been included in the draft prospectus.
(31)
To facilitate the drawing up of a prospectus and thus to facilitate the raising of capital by undertakings established in the Union, and to ensure that common standards are applied when scrutinizing and approving prospectuses, all requirements related to the format, content, scrutiny and approval of prospectuses should be laid down in a single Regulation.
(32)
Since this Delegated Regulation replaces Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004 (2), the latter has become obsolete and should therefore be repealed.
(33)
For reasons of coherence, the application of this Regulation should be deferred until the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
SUMMARY OF:
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/979 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on regulatory technical standards on key financial information in the summary of a prospectus, the publication and classification of prospectuses, advertisements for securities, supplements to a prospectus, and the notification portal
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on format, content, scrutiny and approval of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/528 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 on the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, a merger or a division
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the prospectus regulation), as supplemented by Delegated Regulations (EU) 2019/979, 2019/980 and 2019/528, aims to help companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), access different forms of finance in the European Union (EU). It does so by simplifying and streamlining the rules and procedures for drawing up, approving and distributing the prospectus* they publish when offering securities* to the public or admitting securities to trading on a regulated market.
The legislation reduces costly and burdensome red tape for companies and enables investors to make the right investment decision by providing comprehensible, easy to analyse and concise information.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation:
removes the need for a prospectus for any offer of securities to the public, including crowdfunding (raising money from a large group of people, often via the internet) projects, below €1 million (previously the limit was €100,000);
allows EU Member States to be exempt from the need for a prospectus for offers of securities to the public of up to €8 million, provided that they do not require notification (a ‘passport’);
sets out rules to curb the tendency to overload prospectuses with generic risk factors;
strengthens supervisory convergence by harmonising scrutiny and approval of prospectuses (including the applicable timelines) throughout the EU;
enables companies that frequently issue securities to use the universal registration document to secure fast-track approval from supervisors within 5 days;
introduces a European online database, operated free of charge by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), containing all prospectuses approved in the European Economic Area.
The regulation requires a prospectus to enable an investor to make an informed decision. It must include:
assets, liabilities, profits, losses, financial position and prospects for the issuer and any guarantor;
rights attached to the securities;
reasons for issuing the securities and their impact on the issuer;
a clear and accurate seven-page summary (except for the admission to trading of non-equity securities only targeting qualified investors), which provides: an introduction with warnings that the investor could lose all or part of the invested capital,key information on the securities, including the type and class of securities and the rights attached to the securities,information about the issuer,a brief description of the nature and scope of a guarantee.
The regulation establishes a standardised and simplified EU growth prospectus for:
SMEs, defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (the MiFID II directive) (see summary) as companies which meet at least two of the following three criteria: an average number of employees during the financial year of less than 250,a total balance sheet not exceeding €43 million,an annual net turnover not exceeding €50 million;
issuers, other than SMEs, whose securities are traded or to be traded on an SME growth market (a market that offers access to capital for SMEs), with an average market capitalisation (market value of the company’s shares) of below €500 million;
offerors of securities issued by issuers referred to in the two previous points;
non-listed companies (not listed on any stock market) which offer securities to the public of less than €20 million in any given 12 months, provided that they have fewer than 500 employees;
issuers, other than SMEs, that offer shares to the public and at the same time seek admission of those shares to trading on an SME growth market, provided that: such issuers have no shares already admitted to trading on an SME growth market,the combined value of the final offer price (or, if not available, the maximum price) and the total number of shares outstanding immediately after the share offer to the public is less than €200 million.
The abovementioned companies can benefit from this tailored prospectus provided that they have no securities admitted to trading on a regulated market.
The regulation provides for a simplified prospectus for companies listed for at least 18 months on a regulated market or an SME growth market and wishing to issue additional shares or raise debt (secondary issuance).
The regulation harmonises the minimum information content of the document to be published for a prospectus exemption in connection with a takeover by means of an exchange offer, a merger or a division.
Amending regulations
Regulation (EU) 2019/2115 seeks to promote the use of SME growth markets by reducing formalities and administrative burdens on SMEs in terms of disclosure obligations and a simplified prospectus.
Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 introduces a prospectus exemption for offers of securities to the public made by crowdfunding service providers that do not exceed the threshold of €5 million in accordance with the conditions specified in that regulation.
Regulation (EU) 2021/337 introduces a new ‘EU recovery prospectus’ to help companies recover from the COVID-19 crisis. This shorter prospectus, with a maximum length of 30 pages plus a two-page summary, makes it easier for companies to raise capital to meet their funding needs, while ensuring adequate information is provided to investors. The recovery prospectus will be available for capital increases of up to 150% of outstanding capital within a period of 12 months and applies until the end of 2022.

FROM WHEN DO THE REGULATIONS APPLY?
Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 and Delegated Regulations (EU) 2019/979 and (EU) 2019/980 have applied since 21 July 2019.

BACKGROUND
Directive 2003/71/EC was designed to make it easier for companies to raise capital throughout the EU on the basis of approval from just one national supervisor. This gave a ‘passport’ for prospectuses containing cross-border offers. Regulation (EU) 2017/1129, which repeals and replaces Directive 2003/71/EEC, addresses the areas of legal uncertainty and unjustified administrative burdens which had emerged over time. It is considered a major milestone towards a European capital markets union.

last update 22.11.2021","{'header': '21.6.2019 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 166/26', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/980\nof 14 March 2019\nsupplementing Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the format, content, scrutiny and approval of the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market, and repealing Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 lays down requirements to be complied with when drawing up prospectuses. The requirements concerning the scrutiny, review, approval and filing of the universal registration document and any amendments thereto, the requirements concerning the format of the prospectus, the base prospectus and the final terms, the specific information to be included in a prospectus, the minimum information to be included in the universal registration document, the reduced information to be included under the simplified disclosure regime for secondary issuances, the reduced content, the standardised format and the sequence of the EU Growth prospectus, the reduced content and standardised format of the specific summary and the scrutiny and approval of prospectuses all need to be specified.\n\n((2)) The content and the format of a prospectus depend on a variety of factors, such as the type of issuer, type of security, type of issuance as well as the possible involvement of a third party as a guarantor and the question of whether or not there is an admission to trading. It is therefore not appropriate to lay down the same requirements for all types of prospectuses. Specific information requirements should be laid down instead and should be combined depending on those factors and the type of prospectus. This should however not prevent an issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to provide in the prospectus the most comprehensive information available.\n\n((3)) To ensure legal certainty and increase transparency for investors, issuers should state in their universal registration document whether the universal registration document has been approved by the competent authority or merely has been filed and published without prior approval.\n\n((4)) The alleviated information requirements for secondary issuances should reflect the specificities of equity and non-equity securities.\n\n((5)) Collective investment undertakings of the close-end type pursue specific investment objectives and might be subject to specific investment restrictions. The registration documents for those undertakings should therefore be subject to specific information requirements.\n\n((6)) Due to the indirect link between the investor and the underlying shares of depository receipts, it is important that the investor is informed about the issuer of the underlying shares. The prospectus for depository receipts should therefore contain, apart from information about the depositary receipt and the issuer of the depository receipt, information about the underlying shares and the issuer of those underlying shares.\n\n((7)) The information contained in prospectuses for non-equity securities should be adapted to the level of knowledge and expertise of each type of investor. Prospectuses for non-equity securities in which retail investors can invest should therefore be subject to more comprehensive and distinct information requirements than prospectuses for non-equity securities that are reserved to qualified investors.\n\n((8)) The obligation to produce a prospectus applies to non-equity securities issued by third countries and their regional and local authorities in cases where those entities wish to make a public offer of securities in the Union or wish their securities to be admitted to trading on a regulated market. Due to the particular nature of those public entities, specific information requirements should be laid down.\n\n((9)) Investors should be able to understand the situation of an issuer with a complex financial history and the expected effects of a transaction involving a significant financial commitment. Those issuers should therefore be required to include additional information in the prospectus to that effect.\n\n((10)) Where securities are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are already admitted to trading on a regulated market, shareholders and investors normally already have the information about the underlying shares of those securities. It is therefore sufficient to add to the prospectus a statement setting out the type of the underlying share and details of where information about the underlying share can be obtained.\n\n((11)) Investors may want to invest in securities that are exchangeable for or convertible into shares that are or will be issued by the issuer of those securities or by an entity belonging to that issuer’s group and that have not yet been admitted to trading on a regulated market. Those investors should have the same information about the ability of the issuer of the underlying shares to continue its operations and about its indebtedness compared to its capitalisation as investors that have invested in those shares directly. The prospectus should therefore contain a working capital statement as well as a statement of capitalisation and indebtedness of the issuer of the underlying shares.\n\n((12)) Derivative securities entail particular risks for investors because, for instance, the losses might be higher than the investment made and because the underlying is not always admitted to trading on a regulated market and information about that underlying might therefore not be available. Some non-equity securities, such as structured bonds, also incorporate certain elements of a derivative security. Consequently, the securities note should contain additional information about the underlying of a derivative security or about the derivative component of the non-equity security and, where applicable, a statement about the potential losses that investors might face.\n\n((13)) Where a base prospectus is drawn up for securities linked to or backed by an underlying asset, that base prospectus should contain all information about the type of underlying asset where that underlying asset is known at the date of approval of the base prospectus. Market conditions may however change the choice of the underlying asset within a category of underlying assets. Only the final terms of the base prospectus should therefore contain specific details about that underlying asset.\n\n((14)) Guarantees are intended to ensure that the payments related to the security are duly serviced. Given the potential diversity in guarantees, clear information requirements related to the nature and the scope of those guarantees should be laid down.\n\n((15)) The format of the prospectus, base prospectus and final terms should be specified by determining the order in which the required information should be disclosed. However, due to the multipurpose character of the universal registration document, issuers who choose to draw up and publish a universal registration document every financial year should be granted more flexibility as regards the order of information to be provided in the universal registration document.\n\n((16)) Whilst the base prospectus should contain all information available at the time of drawing up that base prospectus, it should be possible to leave blanks as regards specific information that only becomes available at a later stage and is to be found in the final terms, or to include a list of that missing information.\n\n((17)) It is not always required to include a summary into the prospectus. That should however not prevent the insertion of an overview section into the prospectus. To avoid confusion among investors, such overview section should however not be called a summary, unless it complies with all the requirements for summaries.\n\n((18)) The EU growth prospectus is intended to alleviate the administrative burden, in particular for SMEs. It is therefore appropriate to simplify the drafting of EU growth prospectuses by laying down a fixed order in which the information should be presented. However, to ensure that information is presented in a manner that is coherent and consistent with the different business models, flexibility should be allowed as regards the order of information items within each section of the EU growth prospectus.\n\n((19)) To allow for flexibility and to encourage the use of the EU growth prospectus, it should be possible that the EU growth prospectus is composed of separate documents. To avoid the risk of duplicating information, separate detailed information requirements for the specific registration document on the one hand and for the specific securities note on the other should be laid down and adapted to the type of securities concerned, differentiating between equity and non-equity securities.\n\n((20)) The specific summary of the EU Growth prospectus should provide investors with key information needed to decide which offers of securities they want to study further by reviewing the prospectus as a whole. It should therefore convey the essential characteristics of, and risks associated with, the issuer and the securities offered and contain the general terms and conditions of the offer. However, given that the specific summary is only an introduction to the EU Growth prospectus and must be read together with the other parts thereof, the content of the specific summary should be consistent with those other parts. To ensure that the size of the specific summary is tailored to the reduced size of the EU Growth prospectus, the length of the summary should be restricted.\n\n((21)) To ensure that competent authorities apply harmonised standards across the Union when scrutinising prospectuses, and in particular the completeness, comprehensibility and consistency of the information contained in draft prospectuses, criteria for prospectus scrutiny should be laid down. Those criteria should be applied for the entire draft prospectus and any of its constituent parts, including the universal registration document and any amendments and supplements to the prospectus.\n\n((22)) A high level of investor protection should be ensured. Competent authorities should therefore be allowed to consider, where necessary, additional criteria for the scrutiny of the completeness, consistency and comprehensibility of draft prospectuses in order to adapt that scrutiny to the specific characteristics of a prospectus.\n\n((23)) Some issuers are involved into very specific business activities that require a profound knowledge of the activities concerned to have a full understanding of the securities issued by those issuers. That would apply for example in the case of a property company that could be required to disclose a valuation report providing all relevant details in respect of material properties necessary for the purposes of the valuation. Competent authorities should therefore be able to take a proportionate approach and require, where appropriate, that those specialist issuers include in the prospectus specific and adapted information about those activities that goes beyond the information required from non-specialist issuers.\n\n((24)) Due to the rapid evolution of securities markets, there is the possibility that certain types of securities that are not covered by the Annexes to this Regulation will be offered to the public or admitted to trading. In such a case, to enable investors to make an informed investment decision, competent authorities should decide in consultation with the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market which information should be included in the prospectus.\n\n((25)) To drive efficiency in the process of drawing up the prospectus and eliminate unnecessary burdens, it is appropriate to allow the omission of information items set out in the Annexes to this Regulation that are not pertinent to the issuer or to the securities being offered or admitted to trading on a regulated market.\n\n((26)) Scrutiny and approval of prospectuses is an iterative process. As such, the decision of the competent authority to approve the draft prospectus may involve several rounds of analysis of the draft prospectus and ensuing improvements by the issuer, offeror or person asking for admission to trading on a regulated market to ensure that the draft prospectus meets the standards of completeness, comprehensibility and consistency. To provide certainty about the approval process, it is necessary to specify which documents should be provided to competent authorities at the different stages of the approval process.\n\n((27)) For reasons of efficiency, competent authorities should be permitted to carry out a lighter scrutiny where a draft prospectus replicates information that has already been scrutinised or reviewed.\n\n((28)) To enable competent authorities to search for specific terms or words in submitted documents and thus to ensure an efficient and timely scrutiny process of the prospectuses, draft prospectuses and accompanying information should be submitted in searchable electronic format and through electronic means acceptable to the competent authority.\n\n((29)) Issuers, offerors or persons asking for admission to trading on a regulated market should be able to demonstrate to the competent authority how they addressed issues notified by that authority. Each draft of the prospectus submitted to the competent authority, with the exception of the first draft, should therefore contain both a marked-up version that clearly highlights all changes made to the previously submitted draft, and a clean version where such changes are not highlighted.\n\n((30)) To minimise delays in the scrutiny process, competent authorities should be able to identify quickly information requirements that are not applicable or not relevant. For that purpose, the competent authorities should be informed about the information that has not been included in the draft prospectus.\n\n((31)) To facilitate the drawing up of a prospectus and thus to facilitate the raising of capital by undertakings established in the Union, and to ensure that common standards are applied when scrutinizing and approving prospectuses, all requirements related to the format, content, scrutiny and approval of prospectuses should be laid down in a single Regulation.\n\n((32)) Since this Delegated Regulation replaces Commission Regulation (EC) No 809/2004(2), the latter has become obsolete and should therefore be repealed.\n\n((33)) For reasons of coherence, the application of this Regulation should be deferred until the date of application of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Definitions', 'text': 'Article 1\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall

COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2019/785
of 14 May 2019
on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology in the Union and repealing Decision 2007/131/EC
(notified under document C(2019) 3461)
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision) (1), and in particular Article 4(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Commission Decision 2007/131/EC (2) harmonises the technical conditions for spectrum use by radio equipment based on ultra-wideband (‘UWB’) technology in the Union. It ensures that radio spectrum is available across the Union under harmonised conditions, eliminates barriers to the take-up of UWB technology and aims at creating an effective single market for UWB systems with significant economies of scale and benefits to the consumer.
(2)
Although ultra-wideband signals are typically of extremely low power, the possibility of harmful interference with existing radiocommunication services exists and needs to be managed. Therefore, this Decision on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for UWB equipment should avoid harmful interference (including where this might arise from access to the radio spectrum by radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research systems) and balance the incumbent services' interests against the overall policy objective of providing favourable conditions for the introduction of innovative technologies for the benefit of society.
(3)
On 16 March 2017, the Commission issued a permanent mandate, pursuant to Decision No 676/2002/EC, to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (‘CEPT’) to identify the technical conditions for the harmonised introduction of radio applications based on UWB technology in the Union in order to provide updated technical conditions for such applications.
(4)
In response to that permanent mandate, CEPT adopted a report (3) where it proposed four measures. Firstly, the technical conditions should describe material sensing devices in a more neutral way in order to allow for innovative solutions. Secondly, it should be possible to use the conditions for generic UWB usage also for material sensing applications. Thirdly, there should be a – 65 dBm/MHz limit for all material sensing devices including building material analysis (BMA) in the 8,5-10,6 GHz band. Fourthly, the possibility of a trigger-before-transmit mitigation for vehicular access control systems based on UWB technology should be introduced in the 3,8-4,2 GHz and 6-8,5 GHz frequency bands.
(5)
This Decision should support the overall harmonisation of the UWB regulatory framework in order to improve consistency of limits and mitigation techniques between the different UWB regulations and allow for innovative solutions in the field of UWB technology.
(6)
This Decision provides for regulatory limits and identifies mitigation techniques to ensure an efficient usage of spectrum while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users. Technological evolution may provide other solutions that ensure at least an equivalent level of spectrum protection. For this reason, the use of alternative mitigation techniques, such as solutions found in future possible harmonised standards produced by the European Standardisation Organisations, should be allowed provided they ensure at least an equivalent level of performance and spectrum protection and verifiably respect the established technical requirements of this regulatory framework.
(7)
Decision 2007/131/EC has been amended several times. In the interest of legal clarity Decision 2007/131/EC should be repealed.
(8)
The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The purpose of this Decision is to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum by equipment using ultra-wideband technology in the Union.
Article 2
For the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:
(a)
‘equipment using ultra-wideband technology’ means equipment incorporating, as an integral part or as an accessory, technology for short-range radiocommunication, involving the intentional generation and transmission of radio-frequency energy that spreads over a frequency range wider than 50 MHz, which may overlap several frequency bands allocated to radiocommunication services;
(b)
‘non-interference and non-protected basis’ means that no harmful interference may be caused to any radiocommunication service and that no claim may be made for protection of these devices against interference originating from radiocommunication services;
(c)
‘indoors’ means inside buildings or places in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to protect radiocommunication services against harmful interference;
(d)
‘motor vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(11) of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4);
(e)
‘railway vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(1)(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5);
(f)
‘e.i.r.p.’ means equivalent isotropically radiated power, which is the product of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna (absolute or isotropic gain);
(g)
‘maximum mean power spectral density’ means the average power per unit bandwidth (centred on that frequency) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p. of the radio device under test at a particular frequency;
(h)
‘peak power’ means the power contained within a 50 MHz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs, radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p.;
(i)
‘total power spectral density’ means the average of the mean power spectral density values measured over a sphere around the measurement scenario with a resolution of at least 15 degrees;
(j)
‘onboard aircraft’ means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft;
(k)
‘LT1’ means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects that can be put into service on an unlicensed basis.
Article 3
Within six months after this Decision takes effect, Member States shall designate and make available the radio spectrum, on a non-interference and non-protected basis, for equipment using ultra-wideband technology provided that such equipment meets the conditions set out in the Annex and it is used indoors or, if it is used outdoors, it is not attached to a fixed installation, a fixed infrastructure or a fixed outdoor antenna. Equipment using ultra-wideband technology which meets the conditions set out in the Annex shall also be allowed in motor and railway vehicles.
Article 4
Member States shall monitor the use of the bands identified in the Annex by equipment using ultra-wideband technology, in particular to ensure that all the conditions laid down in Article 3 of this Decision continue to be relevant, and report their findings to the Commission.
Article 5
Decision 2007/131/EC is repealed.
Article 6
This Decision is addressed to Member States.

‘Trigger-before-transmit’ mitigation is defined as a UWB transmission that is only initiated when necessary, specifically where the system indicates that UWB devices are nearby. The communication is either triggered by a user or by the vehicle. The subsequent communication can be considered as ‘triggered communication’. The existing LDC mitigation applies (or alternatively TPC in the 6 GHz to 8,5 GHz range). An exterior limit requirement must not be applied when using the trigger-before-transmit mitigation technique for vehicular access systems.
Trigger-before-transmit mitigation techniques that provide an appropriate level of performance in order to comply with the essential requirements of Directive 2014/53/EU shall be used for vehicular access systems. If relevant techniques are described in harmonised standards or parts thereof the references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union under Directive 2014/53/EU, performance at least equivalent to these techniques shall be ensured. These techniques shall respect the technical requirements of this Decision.

5.   MATERIAL SENSING DEVICES USING UWB TECHNOLOGY
5.1.   Introduction
UWB material sensing devices are split into two classes:
—
Contact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when in direct contact with the material under investigation;
—
Non-contact based UWB material sensing devices, for which the UWB transmitter is only switched on when it is near the investigated material and the UWB transmitter is directed towards the material under investigation (for example manually by using a proximity sensor or by mechanical design).
Material sensing devices based on UWB technology shall comply either with the generic UWB regulation based on technical conditions specified in section 1 of this Annex or with the specific limits for material sensing devices as defined in sections 5.2 and 5.3.
The generic UWB regulation excludes fixed outdoor installations. Emissions radiated by a material sensing device must not exceed the limits of the regulation for generic UWB usage specified in section 1. Material sensing devices must fulfil the requirements of mitigation techniques specified for the generic use of UWB in section 1.
The specific limits for material sensing devices including the mitigation techniques are listed in the following tables. Emissions radiating from material sensing devices permitted under this Decision must be kept to a minimum and in any case not exceed the emission limits within the following tables. Compliance with the specific limits must be ensured by the device placed on a representative structure of the investigated material. The specific limits listed in the following tables are applicable in all environments for material sensing devices, except those to which note 5 of these tables, which excludes fixed outdoor installation in certain applicable frequency ranges, applies.

WHAT ARE THE AIMS OF THE DIRECTIVE AND DECISIONS?
The implementing decisions mostly concern harmonisation, while others deal with specific frequency bands for specific purposes, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable. EU countries are responsible for radio spectrum management, and the amendments reflect how European and international harmonisation and technical agreements have evolved.
The ‘DECT’ directive designates the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992 and obliges EU countries to bring into force the necessary national laws, regulations and administrative rules.
KEY POINTS
The decisions
The implementing decisions cover radio equipment devices that are operated through general authorisation or on an unlicensed or shared basis by end-users. This includes radio local access network devices (wi-fi) devices which have shown massive growth in demand for radio spectrum, as acknowledged in the 2018 European Electronic Communications Code.
Many of these acts are harmonisation decisions. Others deal with frequency bands for different purposes, such as a huge variety of short range devices, Internet of Things (IoT) equipment, ultra-wide band equipment, alarms, door openers, medical implants, intelligent transport systems, radio frequency identification devices (RFID), radio determination, ground probing, and new types of machine-to-machine devices, as well as equipment for programme making and special events (PMSE) such as wireless video links or microphones and digital cordless telephones.
A further general authorisation band relates to vehicle safety, in particular to the operation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS).
The various implementing decisions cover the following radio spectrum, in addition to limits on signal strength and harmful interference where applicable:
the 5 GHz frequency band (5 150-5 350 MHz and 5 470-5 725 MHz) for wireless access systems, including radio local area networks (WAS/RLANs — wi-fi broadband);
the 3 400-3 800 MHz frequency band for terrestrial systems for ‘fixed, nomadic and mobile electronic communications networks’;
the 5 875-5 935 MHz frequency band for safety-related applications of Intelligent Transport Systems;
the radio spectrum for use by short-range devices;
the 24 GHz range radio spectrum band for the time-limited use by automotive short-range radar equipment;
radio spectrum use by wireless audio programme-making and special events equipment;
the 2 010-2 025 MHz frequency band for portable or mobile wireless video links and cordless cameras used for programme making and special events;
the 900 MHz and 1 800 MHz frequency bands for terrestrial systems capable of providing electronic communications services in relation to the Internet of Things;
radio spectrum for use by short-range devices within the 874-876 and 915-921 MHz frequency bands;
radio spectrum for equipment using ultra-wideband technology, such as vehicle and aircraft location tracking.
Directive 91/287/EEC
The directive obliges EU countries to designate the 1 880-1 900 MHz frequency band for digital cordless communications by 1 January 1992.

It ensures that radio spectrum is available across the Union under harmonised conditions, eliminates barriers to the take-up of UWB technology and aims at creating an effective single market for UWB systems with significant economies of scale and benefits to the consumer.\n\n((2)) Although ultra-wideband signals are typically of extremely low power, the possibility of harmful interference with existing radiocommunication services exists and needs to be managed. Therefore, this Decision on the harmonisation of radio spectrum for UWB equipment should avoid harmful interference (including where this might arise from access to the radio spectrum by radio astronomy, earth exploration satellite and space research systems) and balance the incumbent services' interests against the overall policy objective of providing favourable conditions for the introduction of innovative technologies for the benefit of society.\n\n((3)) On 16\xa0March 2017, the Commission issued a permanent mandate, pursuant to Decision No 676/2002/EC, to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (‘CEPT’) to identify the technical conditions for the harmonised introduction of radio applications based on UWB technology in the Union in order to provide updated technical conditions for such applications.\n\n((4)) In response to that permanent mandate, CEPT adopted a report(3)where it proposed four measures.\xa0Firstly, the technical conditions should describe material sensing devices in a more neutral way in order to allow for innovative solutions.\xa0Secondly, it should be possible to use the conditions for generic UWB usage also for material sensing applications.\xa0Thirdly, there should be a – 65 dBm/MHz limit for all material sensing devices including building material analysis (BMA) in the 8,5-10,6 GHz band. Fourthly, the possibility of a trigger-before-transmit mitigation for vehicular access control systems based on UWB technology should be introduced in the 3,8-4,2 GHz and 6-8,5 GHz frequency bands.\n\n((5)) This Decision should support the overall harmonisation of the UWB regulatory framework in order to improve consistency of limits and mitigation techniques between the different UWB regulations and allow for innovative solutions in the field of UWB technology.\n\n((6)) This Decision provides for regulatory limits and identifies mitigation techniques to ensure an efficient usage of spectrum while ensuring coexistence with other spectrum users.\xa0Technological evolution may provide other solutions that ensure at least an equivalent level of spectrum protection. For this reason, the use of alternative mitigation techniques, such as solutions found in future possible harmonised standards produced by the European Standardisation Organisations, should be allowed provided they ensure at least an equivalent level of performance and spectrum protection and verifiably respect the established technical requirements of this regulatory framework.\n\n((7)) Decision 2007/131/EC has been amended several times.\xa0In the interest of legal clarity Decision 2007/131/EC should be repealed.\n\n((8)) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Radio Spectrum Committee,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'text': 'Article 1\nThe purpose of this Decision is to harmonise the technical conditions for the availability and efficient use of radio spectrum by equipment using ultra-wideband technology in the Union.'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'text': 'Article 2\nFor the purposes of this Decision, the following definitions shall apply:\n(a)\n‘equipment using ultra-wideband technology’ means equipment incorporating, as an integral part or as an accessory, technology for short-range radiocommunication, involving the intentional generation and transmission of radio-frequency energy that spreads over a frequency range wider than 50 MHz, which may overlap several frequency bands allocated to radiocommunication services;\n(b)\n‘non-interference and non-protected basis’ means that no harmful interference may be caused to any radiocommunication service and that no claim may be made for protection of these devices against interference originating from radiocommunication services;\n(c)\n‘indoors’ means inside buildings or places in which the shielding will typically provide the necessary attenuation to protect radiocommunication services against harmful interference;\n(d)\n‘motor vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(11) of Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(\n4\n)\n;\n(e)\n‘railway vehicle’ has the same meaning as set out in Article 3(1)(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/643 of the European Parliament and of the Council\n(\n5\n)\n;\n(f)\n‘e.i.r.p.’ means equivalent isotropically radiated power, which is the product of the power supplied to the antenna and the antenna gain in a given direction relative to an isotropic antenna (absolute or isotropic gain);\n(g)\n‘maximum mean power spectral density’ means the average power per unit bandwidth (centred on that frequency) radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p.\xa0of the radio device under test at a particular frequency;\n(h)\n‘peak power’ means the power contained within a 50 MHz bandwidth at the frequency at which the highest mean radiated power occurs, radiated in the direction of the maximum level under the specified conditions of measurement and which is specified as e.i.r.p.;\n(i)\n‘total power spectral density’ means the average of the mean power spectral density values measured over a sphere around the measurement scenario with a resolution of at least 15 degrees;\n(j)\n‘onboard aircraft’ means the use of radio links for communications purposes inside an aircraft;\n(k)\n‘LT1’ means systems intended for general location tracking of people and objects that can be put into service on an unlicensed basis.'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'text': 'Article 3\nWithin six months after this Decision takes effect, Member States shall designate and make available the radio spectrum, on a non-interference and non-protected basis, for equipment using ultra-wideband technology provided that such equipment meets the conditions set out in the Annex and it is used indoors or, if it is used outdoors, it is not attached to a fixed installation, a fixed infrastructure or a fixed outdoor antenna.

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/1122
of 12 March 2019
supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the functioning of the Union Registry
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular Article 19(3) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Article 19(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that all allowances issued from 1 January 2012 onwards are held in a Union Registry. Such a Union Registry was initially established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 (2).
(2)
Commission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 (3) repealed Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 to lay down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry for the trading period starting on 1 January 2013 and subsequent periods, concerning the independent transaction log provided for in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, and concerning registries provided for in Article 6 of Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (4).
(3)
The Union Registry ensures the accurate accounting of transactions under the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC. The Union Registry is a standardised and secured electronic database containing common data elements to track the issue, holding, transfer and cancellation, as applicable, of allowances, and to provide for public access and confidentiality, as appropriate. It should ensure that there are no transfers, which are incompatible with the obligations resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC.
(4)
A new period of economy-wide legislation applies from 2021 that is the start of a new period for the EU ETS. It is necessary to ensure that the implementation and the functioning of the registries system comply also with the requirements set for this new period.
(5)
Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council (5) amended substantially Directive 2003/87/EC so as to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, requiring changes to the Union Registry. The provisions introduced by those amendments apply to the periods from 2021.
(6)
Pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2003/87/EC, allowances issued from 1 January 2013 onwards are valid indefinitely. However, from 2021 onwards, the allowances are to include an indication of the trading period of their creation. It is therefore necessary to provide the appropriate functionalities in the Union Registry. The indication showing in which ten-year period the allowances were created should only be visible to account holders where this is needed to distinguish the allowances created in one phase from those created in another phase. This is the case during the transition from the third trading period to the fourth, taking into account the fact that allowances created in the period starting in 2021 are only valid for emissions from 1 January 2021 onwards.
(7)
In addition, restriction to the surrender of allowances should be applied to ensure that allowances can only be used for emissions from the first year of the ten-year period in which they were issued. The rules for the calculation of the compliance status figure are necessary in order to ensure the compliance with this restriction.
(8)
Directive (EU) 2018/410 deleted paragraph 7 of Article 11b of Directive 2003/87/EC. The use of international credits in the EU ETS will therefore no longer be possible in the trading period starting from 1 January 2021. Consequently, no international credits may be held on ETS accounts and international credit entitlements will cease to exist. However, until all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2013 and 2020 are concluded, the use of international credits, and consequently of international credit entitlements, should be maintained. Non-eligible units should be removed from ETS accounts after the end of the continued applicability of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013.
(9)
Following the classification of emission allowances consisting of any units recognised for compliance with the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC as ‘financial instruments’ under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (6), it is appropriate to adapt the rules regulating the Union Registry to align them with the requirements of the financial market legislation to the extent necessary, in particular by ensuring the provision of relevant information allowing the effective enforcement of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (7).
(10)
In accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council (8), financial instruments are to be identified by means of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISIN codes) defined in ISO 6166. In order to facilitate the fulfilment of reporting obligations by the account holders, the ISIN codes for emission allowances should be displayed in the Union Registry.
(11)
The smooth implementation of the auctioning process under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 (9), stemming primarily from the experience gained from the implementation of the auctioning process, and from the fact that from 3 January 2018 spot emission allowances listed in point (11) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU are classified as financial instruments, requires amendments to Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. In particular, this classification means that spot emission allowances come within the scope of Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (10). The amendments are necessary to better align the processes covering the auctions in this Regulation with the requirements of Directive 98/26/EC including their harmonised implementation under national law, where necessary, for the purposes of the auctioning of emission allowances.
(12)
As allowances exist only in dematerialised form and are fungible, the title to an allowance should be established by its existence in the account of the Union Registry in which it is held. Moreover, to reduce the risks associated with the reversal of transactions entered in the Union Registry, and the consequent disruption to the system and to the market that such reversal may cause, it is necessary to ensure that allowances are fully fungible. In particular, transactions can be reversed, revoked or unwound only in accordance with the rules of the Registry, within a period set by those rules. Nothing in this Regulation should prevent an account holder or a third party from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transaction that has entered a system, such as in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction. Furthermore, the acquisition of an allowance in good faith should be protected.
(13)
The central administrator's main responsibilities should be to provide, operate and maintain the Union Registry and the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), to manage central accounts and to perform operations which are carried out centrally. The national administrators' main responsibilities should be to be the contact point with their respective account holders in the Union Registry and perform all operations involving direct contact with them, including the opening, suspension of access to and closure of accounts.
(14)
Where Member States allocate allowances free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC, these allowances should be issued in accordance with Article 10c of that Directive.
(15)
Regulation (EU) 2017/2392 of the European Parliament and of the Council (11) amended Directive 2003/87/EC. That amendment extended the derogation from the EU ETS obligations for flights to and from third countries until 31 December 2023. Accordingly, aircraft operators benefiting from the derogation are to continue to receive free allowances until that date. From 1 January 2021, the number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators is subject to the application of the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
(16)
Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC provides that competent authorities are to transfer, by 28 February of each year, the number of allowances allocated to operators for free for that year. Where that Directive provides for the recalculation of the number of allowances allocated to an operator, the central administrator should ensure that the recalculation of the allocation is made in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC and the required changes are carried out in the Union Registry and the EUTL before the national competent authority may transfer the allowances to the operator concerned.
(17)
Nothing in this Regulation should prevent a competent authority from requiring an operator to transfer a number of allowances, received in excess of its adjusted allocation for the relevant year, to the EU Allocation Account in cases where there has been an over allocation of allowances, including as a result of an error in the original allocation or the operator having failed to correctly or completely submit to the competent authority relevant information provided that the central administrator has carried out a change to the national allocation table of the Member State.
(18)
Allowances issued after an operator has ceased the activities performed in the installation to which those allowances relate, without informing the competent authority beforehand, cannot be classified as emissions allowances within the meaning of Directive 2003/87/EC. This implies that in case the excess allocation results from the operator not reporting the cessation of production, it should be possible to remove from the operator holding account the corresponding number of allowances even without the approval of the operator.
(19)
Adequate and harmonised requirements on opening of accounts, authentication and access rights should be applied to protect the security of information held in the Union Registry and to avoid fraud. The requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be reviewed and updated with the purpose of ensuring their effectiveness while taking into account proportionality. Although the administrators of the Union Registry are not directly subject to requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council (12), requirements and safeguard measures of that Directive are also reflected in the rules governing the opening and maintaining of accounts in the Union Registry, with special regard to information of beneficial owners. The rules in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be revised to allow national administrators to adapt their procedures to the actual risk represented by a particular action.
(20)
If an original document, originating in another Member State, or a certified copy thereof, is submitted as evidence under Annexes IV or VIII, the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 of the European Parliament and of the Council (13) should be applied accordingly.
(21)
National administrators, the central administrator and the Commission are to comply with Union and national legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (14), and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (15), where they are applicable to information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation.
(22)
Records concerning all processes, operators and persons in the registries system should be kept, while personal data contained in them should be deleted after the expiry of the relevant retention period.
(23)
The Commission and the national administrators are joint controllers of the information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation. The Union Registry and the EUTL performs tasks that are carried out in the public interest. In the case of a personal data breach, the relevant notification procedures pursuant to data protection legislation are applicable.
(24)
National administrators, the central administrator and the Commission should ensure that information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation can only be used for the purpose of the functioning of the Union Registry.
(25)
The rules governing the Union Registry should be simplified in order to reduce any administrative burden to the extent possible, without undermining the environmental integrity, security or reliability of the EU ETS. To define the direction and extent of possible simplifications and alleviations, the practical experience of national administrators of the Union Registry was gathered and Member States were consulted. The resulting new rules intend to provide for easier understanding and use of the Union Registry both by its users and administrators.
(26)
Where necessary and for as long as necessary in order to protect the environmental integrity of the EU ETS, aviation operators and other operators in the EU ETS may not use allowances that are issued by a Member State which has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (‘TEU’).
(27)
Linking the EU ETS with other emissions trading systems expands opportunities for emissions reductions, thereby cutting the cost of fighting climate change. The operationalisation of linking agreements pursuant to Article 25 of Directive 2003/87/EC requires a number of adaptations in the Union Registry. Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be amended to, inter alia, ensure the recognition of allowances of third countries for compliance, enable the transfer of such allowances, the creation of accounts, transaction processes and to include the conditions for suspension of the link.
(28)
All operations required in relation to the third trading period of the EU ETS between 2013 and 2020 should be completed in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. As Directive 2003/87/EC allowed for the use of international credits generated pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, that Regulation should continue to apply to those operations. In order to provide clarity about the rules applying to all operations related to the third trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (16), on the one hand, and the rules applying to all operations related to the fourth trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/410, on the other hand, the scope of application of those provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 which continue to apply, after the entry into force of the present Regulation, for the operations related to the third trading period should be limited to that purpose.
(29)

TITLE II
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS FOR THE UNION REGISTRY FOR THE UNION EMISSIONS TRADING SYSTEM
CHAPTER 1
Verified emissions and compliance
Article 31
Verified emissions data for an installation or aircraft operator
1.   Whenever required by national law, each operator and aircraft operator shall select a verifier from the list of verifiers registered with the national administrator administering its account.
2.   The national administrator, the competent authority or, upon decision of the competent authority, the account holder or the verifier shall enter emissions data for the previous year.
3.   Annual emissions data shall be submitted using the format set out in Annex IX.
4.   Upon the satisfactory verification in accordance with Article 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC of an operator's report on the emissions from an installation during a previous year, or of an aircraft operator's report on the emissions from all aviation activities it performed during a previous year, the verifier or the competent authority shall approve the annual emissions data.
5.   The emissions approved in accordance with paragraph 4 shall be marked as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry by the national administrator or the competent authority. The competent authority may decide that instead of the national administrator, the verifier shall be responsible for marking emissions as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry. All approved emissions shall be marked ‘verified’ by 31 March.
6.   The competent authority may instruct the national administrator to correct the annual verified emissions for an installation or an aircraft operator to ensure compliance with Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC, by entering the corrected verified or estimated emissions for that installation or an aircraft operator for a given year in the Union Registry.
7.   Where, on 1 May of each year, no verified emissions figure has been recorded in the Union Registry for an installation or an aircraft operator for a previous year or the verified emissions figure was proven to be incorrect, any substitute emissions figure estimate entered in the Union Registry shall be calculated as closely as possible in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC.
Article 32
Blocking of accounts due to a failure to submit verified emissions
1.   If, on 1 April of each year, the annual emissions of an installation or aircraft operator for the preceding year have not been entered and marked as ‘verified’ in the Union Registry, the central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry sets the corresponding operator holding account or aircraft operator holding account to a blocked status.
2.   When all overdue verified emissions of the installation or aircraft operator for that year have been recorded in the Union Registry, the central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry sets the account to open status.
Article 33
Calculation of compliance status figures
1.   The central administrator shall ensure that on 1 May of each year, the Union Registry indicates the compliance status figure for the preceding year for every installation and aircraft operator with an operator or aircraft operator holding account that is not in a closed status by calculating the sum of all allowances surrendered for the current period less the sum of all verified emissions in the current period up to and including the preceding year, plus a correction factor. The compliance status figure shall not be calculated for accounts that had their previous compliance status figure zero or positive and the year of last emissions was set to a year before the preceding year. The calculation shall not take into account the surrender of allowances issued for a period subsequent to the current compliance period.
The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry calculates the compliance status figure before the closure of the account pursuant to Articles 25 and 26.
2.   For the trading periods 2008-2012 and 2013-2020, the correction factor referred to in paragraph 1 shall be zero if the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period was greater than zero, but shall remain the same as the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period if this figure is less than or equal to zero. For the trading periods starting on 1 January 2021, the correction factor referred to in paragraph 1 shall be the same as the compliance status figure of the last year of the previous period.
3.   The central administrator shall ensure that the Union Registry records the compliance status figure for every installation and aircraft operator for each year.
CHAPTER 2

Article 36
Nature of allowances and finality of transactions
1.   An allowance shall be a fungible, dematerialised instrument that is tradable on the market.
2.   The dematerialized nature of allowances shall imply that the record of the Union Registry shall constitute prima facie and sufficient evidence of title over an allowance, and of any other matter which is by this Regulation directed or authorised to be recorded in the Union Registry.
3.   The fungibility of allowances shall imply that any recovery or restitution obligations that may arise under national law in respect of an allowance shall only apply to the allowance in kind.
Subject to Article 58 and the reconciliation process provided for in Article 73, a transaction shall become final and irrevocable upon its finalisation pursuant to Article 74. Without prejudice to any provision of or remedy under national law that may result in a requirement or order to execute a new transaction in the Union Registry, no law, regulation, rule or practice on the setting aside of contracts or transactions shall lead to the unwinding in the registry of a transaction that has become final and irrevocable under this Regulation.
An account holder or a third party shall not be prevented from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law, including to recovery, restitution or damages, in respect of a transaction that has become final in the Union Registry, for instance in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction in the Union Registry.

ANNEX VII
Information to be provided for opening an aircraft operator holding account
1.
The information set out in Table III-I of Annex III and VII-I of Annex VII.
2.
Under the data provided in accordance with Table III-I, the aircraft operator shall be named as the account holder. The name recorded for the account holder shall be identical to the name in the Monitoring Plan. In case the name in the Monitoring Plan is obsolete, the name in the trading registry or the name used by Eurocontrol shall be used.
3.
If the account holder is part of a group, it shall provide a document clearly identifying the structure of the group. If that document is a copy, this shall be certified as a true copy by a notary public or other similar person specified by the national administrator. If the certified copy is issued outside the Member State requesting a copy, the copy shall be legalised, except otherwise provided for by national law. The date of the certification or legalisation shall not be more than three months prior to the date of application.
4.
The call sign is International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) designator in box 7 of the flight plan or, if not available, the registration marking of the aircraft.
5.
If a legal person requests to open an account, national administrators may ask for the submission of the following additional documents:
(a)
a document proving the registration of the legal entity;
(b)
bank account details;
(c)
a confirmation of VAT registration;
(d)
the name, date of birth and nationality of the legal entity's beneficial owner as defined in Article 3(6) of Directive (EU) 2015/849 including the type of ownership or control they are exercising;
(e)
a copy of the instruments establishing the legal entity;
(f)
a copy of the annual report or of the latest audited financial statements, or if no audited financial statements available, a copy of the financial statements stamped by the tax office or the financial director.
6.
Instead of obtaining paper documents proving information required under this Annex, national administrators may use digital tools to retrieve the relevant information, provided that such tools are authorised under national law to provide that information.

Union registry for emissions trading system allowances
SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/1122 on the functioning of the Union registry
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
It aims to guarantee accurate accounting for all allowances issued under the European Union (EU) emissions trading system.
KEY POINTS
EU registry
The EU registry is a single, centralised online database run by the European Commission that holds accounts for operators of facilities such as power stations and airline operators.
It covers all countries taking part in the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC, which aims to reduce emissions in a cost-effective manner as part of the EU’s policy to tackle climate change.
The registry records: facilities covered by the directive in each EU Member State and any free allowances allocated to those facilities;accounts of companies or individuals with such allowances;transfers of allowances performed by account holders;verified annual CO2 emissions of facilities and airline operators;the annual reconciliation of allowances and verified emissions.
Phase IV
This regulation sets out the general, operational and maintenance requirements for the EU registry for phase IV of the EU ETS from 2021 to 2030.
It replaces Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 (see summary), which covered phase III (2013–2020) of the EU ETS.
Main elements
The regulation covers a number of aspects, including the following.
The registries system, which is operated and maintained by a central administrator. The regulation introduces a EU transaction log (EUTL), which automatically checks, records and authorises all transactions between accounts in the registry. It replaces the Community independent transaction log from phase II.
The status and administration of accounts. The regulation simplifies rules on account management with the aim of reducing the burden on national administrators.
Specific rules for the EU ETS registry covering issues such as: verified emissions and compliance;transactions, including rules on the execution of transfers and the creation, allocation and transfer of allowances;improving links between the EU ETS and other ETS schemes where a linking agreement was concluded (e.g. the Swiss ETS – see summary).
Technical rules and requirements for the registry and EU transaction log, including national helpdesks for account holders and representatives.
Repeal
It repeals and replaces Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. The latter continues to apply until 31 December 2025 to all operations in relation to the 2013–2020 trading period and to the Kyoto accounts until the true-up (the additional period for the completion of commitments) of the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in 2023.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 1 January 2021.

last update 11.01.2022","{'header': '2.7.2019 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 177/3', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/1122\nof 12\xa0March 2019\nsupplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the functioning of the Union Registry\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': ""PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Article 19(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC requires that all allowances issued from 1\xa0January 2012 onwards are held in a Union Registry. Such a Union Registry was initially established by Commission Regulation (EU) No 920/2010(2).\n\n((2)) Commission Regulation (EU) No 389/2013(3)repealed Regulation (EU) No 920/2010 to lay down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry for the trading period starting on 1\xa0January 2013 and subsequent periods, concerning the independent transaction log provided for in Article\xa020(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC, and concerning registries provided for in Article 6 of Decision No 280/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(4).\n\n((3)) The Union Registry ensures the accurate accounting of transactions under the system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union (EU ETS), set up by Directive 2003/87/EC. The Union Registry is a standardised and secured electronic database containing common data elements to track the issue, holding, transfer and cancellation, as applicable, of allowances, and to provide for public access and confidentiality, as appropriate. It should ensure that there are no transfers, which are incompatible with the obligations resulting from Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\n((4)) A new period of economy-wide legislation applies from 2021 that is the start of a new period for the EU ETS.\xa0It is necessary to ensure that the implementation and the functioning of the registries system comply also with the requirements set for this new period.\n\n((5)) Directive (EU) 2018/410 of the European Parliament and of the Council(5)amended substantially Directive 2003/87/EC so as to enhance cost-effective emission reductions and low-carbon investments, requiring changes to the Union Registry. The provisions introduced by those amendments apply to the periods from 2021.\n\n((6)) Pursuant to Article 13 of Directive 2003/87/EC, allowances issued from 1\xa0January 2013 onwards are valid indefinitely. However, from 2021 onwards, the allowances are to include an indication of the trading period of their creation. It is therefore necessary to provide the appropriate functionalities in the Union Registry. The indication showing in which ten-year period the allowances were created should only be visible to account holders where this is needed to distinguish the allowances created in one phase from those created in another phase. This is the case during the transition from the third trading period to the fourth, taking into account the fact that allowances created in the period starting in 2021 are only valid for emissions from 1\xa0January 2021 onwards.\n\n((7)) In addition, restriction to the surrender of allowances should be applied to ensure that allowances can only be used for emissions from the first year of the ten-year period in which they were issued. The rules for the calculation of the compliance status figure are necessary in order to ensure the compliance with this restriction.\n\n((8)) Directive (EU) 2018/410 deleted paragraph 7 of Article 11b of Directive 2003/87/EC. The use of international credits in the EU ETS will therefore no longer be possible in the trading period starting from 1\xa0January 2021. Consequently, no international credits may be held on ETS accounts and international credit entitlements will cease to exist. However, until all operations required in relation to the trading period between 2013 and 2020 are concluded, the use of international credits, and consequently of international credit entitlements, should be maintained. Non-eligible units should be removed from ETS accounts after the end of the continued applicability of the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013.\n\n((9)) Following the classification of emission allowances consisting of any units recognised for compliance with the requirements of Directive 2003/87/EC as ‘financial instruments’ under Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council(6), it is appropriate to adapt the rules regulating the Union Registry to align them with the requirements of the financial market legislation to the extent necessary, in particular by ensuring the provision of relevant information allowing the effective enforcement of Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council(7).\n\n((10)) In accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU and Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council(8), financial instruments are to be identified by means of International Securities Identification Numbers (ISIN codes) defined in ISO 6166. In order to facilitate the fulfilment of reporting obligations by the account holders, the ISIN codes for emission allowances should be displayed in the Union Registry.\n\n((11)) The smooth implementation of the auctioning process under Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010(9), stemming primarily from the experience gained from the implementation of the auctioning process, and from the fact that from 3\xa0January 2018 spot emission allowances listed in point (11) of Section C of Annex I to Directive 2014/65/EU are classified as financial instruments, requires amendments to Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. In particular, this classification means that spot emission allowances come within the scope of Directive 98/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(10). The amendments are necessary to better align the processes covering the auctions in this Regulation with the requirements of Directive 98/26/EC including their harmonised implementation under national law, where necessary, for the purposes of the auctioning of emission allowances.\n\n((12)) As allowances exist only in dematerialised form and are fungible, the title to an allowance should be established by its existence in the account of the Union Registry in which it is held. Moreover, to reduce the risks associated with the reversal of transactions entered in the Union Registry, and the consequent disruption to the system and to the market that such reversal may cause, it is necessary to ensure that allowances are fully fungible. In particular, transactions can be reversed, revoked or unwound only in accordance with the rules of the Registry, within a period set by those rules.\xa0Nothing in this Regulation should prevent an account holder or a third party from exercising any right or claim resulting from the underlying transaction that they may have in law to recovery or restitution in respect of a transaction that has entered a system, such as in case of fraud or technical error, as long as this does not lead to the reversal, revocation or unwinding of the transaction. Furthermore, the acquisition of an allowance in good faith should be protected.\n\n((13)) The central administrator's main responsibilities should be to provide, operate and maintain the Union Registry and the European Union Transaction Log (EUTL), to manage central accounts and to perform operations which are carried out centrally. The national administrators' main responsibilities should be to be the contact point with their respective account holders in the Union Registry and perform all operations involving direct contact with them, including the opening, suspension of access to and closure of accounts.\n\n((14)) Where Member States allocate allowances free of charge on the basis of Article 10c of Directive 2003/87/EC, these allowances should be issued in accordance with Article 10c of that Directive.\n\n((15)) Regulation (EU) 2017/2392 of the European Parliament and of the Council(11)amended Directive 2003/87/EC. That amendment extended the derogation from the EU ETS obligations for flights to and from third countries until 31\xa0December 2023. Accordingly, aircraft operators benefiting from the derogation are to continue to receive free allowances until that date. From 1\xa0January 2021, the number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators is subject to the application of the linear factor referred to in Article 9 of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\n((16)) Article 11 of Directive 2003/87/EC provides that competent authorities are to transfer, by 28 February of each year, the number of allowances allocated to operators for free for that year. Where that Directive provides for the recalculation of the number of allowances allocated to an operator, the central administrator should ensure that the recalculation of the allocation is made in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC and the required changes are carried out in the Union Registry and the EUTL\xa0before the national competent authority may transfer the allowances to the operator concerned.\n\n((17)) Nothing in this Regulation should prevent a competent authority from requiring an operator to transfer a number of allowances, received in excess of its adjusted allocation for the relevant year, to the EU Allocation Account in cases where there has been an over allocation of allowances, including as a result of an error in the original allocation or the operator having failed to correctly or completely submit to the competent authority relevant information provided that the central administrator has carried out a change to the national allocation table of the Member State.\n\n((18)) Allowances issued after an operator has ceased the activities performed in the installation to which those allowances relate, without informing the competent authority beforehand, cannot be classified as emissions allowances within the meaning of Directive 2003/87/EC. This implies that in case the excess allocation results from the operator not reporting the cessation of production, it should be possible to remove from the operator holding account the corresponding number of allowances even without the approval of the operator.\n\n((19)) Adequate and harmonised requirements on opening of accounts, authentication and access rights should be applied to protect the security of information held in the Union Registry and to avoid fraud. The requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be reviewed and updated with the purpose of ensuring their effectiveness while taking into account proportionality. Although the administrators of the Union Registry are not directly subject to requirements laid down in Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and of the Council(12), requirements and safeguard measures of that Directive are also reflected in the rules governing the opening and maintaining of accounts in the Union Registry, with special regard to information of beneficial owners.\xa0The rules in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be revised to allow national administrators to adapt their procedures to the actual risk represented by a particular action.\n\n((20)) If an original document, originating in another Member State, or a certified copy thereof, is submitted as evidence under Annexes IV or VIII, the rules of Regulation (EU) 2016/1191 of the European Parliament and of the Council(13)should be applied accordingly.\n\n((21)) National administrators, the central administrator and the Commission are to comply with Union and national legislation concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council(14), and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council(15), where they are applicable to information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation.\n\n((22)) Records concerning all processes, operators and persons in the registries system should be kept, while personal data contained in them should be deleted after the expiry of the relevant retention period.\n\n((23)) The Commission and the national administrators are joint controllers of the information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation. The Union Registry and the EUTL\xa0performs tasks that are carried out in the public interest. In the case of a personal data breach, the relevant notification procedures pursuant to data protection legislation are applicable.\n\n((24)) National administrators, the central administrator and the Commission should ensure that information held and processed pursuant to this Regulation can only be used for the purpose of the functioning of the Union Registry.\n\n((25)) The rules governing the Union Registry should be simplified in order to reduce any administrative burden to the extent possible, without undermining the environmental integrity, security or reliability of the EU ETS.\xa0To define the direction and extent of possible simplifications and alleviations, the practical experience of national administrators of the Union Registry was gathered and Member States were consulted. The resulting new rules intend to provide for easier understanding and use of the Union Registry both by its users and administrators.\n\n((26)) Where necessary and for as long as necessary in order to protect the environmental integrity of the EU ETS, aviation operators and other operators in the EU ETS may not use allowances that are issued by a Member State which has notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (‘TEU’).\n\n((27)) Linking the EU ETS with other emissions trading systems expands opportunities for emissions reductions, thereby cutting the cost of fighting climate change. The operationalisation of linking agreements pursuant to Article 25 of Directive 2003/87/EC requires a number of adaptations in the Union Registry. Therefore, Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 should be amended to, inter alia, ensure the recognition of allowances of third countries for compliance, enable the transfer of such allowances, the creation of accounts, transaction processes and to include the conditions for suspension of the link.\n\n((28)) All operations required in relation to the third trading period of the EU ETS between 2013 and 2020 should be completed in accordance with the rules laid down in Regulation (EU) No 389/2013. As Directive 2003/87/EC allowed for the use of international credits generated pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol, that Regulation should continue to apply to those operations.\xa0In order to provide clarity about the rules applying to all operations related to the third trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council(16), on the one hand, and the rules applying to all operations related to the fourth trading period in accordance with Directive 2003/87/EC, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/410, on the other hand, the scope of application of those provisions of Regulation (EU) No 389/2013 which continue to apply, after the entry into force of the present Regulation, for the operations related to the third trading period should be limited to that purpose.\n\n((29)) The European Data Protection Supervisor was consulted in accordance with Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and delivered an opinion on 18\xa0October 2018,"", 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter', 'text': 'Article 1\nSubject matter\nThis Regulation lays down general, operational and maintenance requirements concerning the Union Registry and the independent transaction log provided for in Article 20(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC.'}, {'id': '1.tit_1', 'subtitle': 'Subject matter', 'text': 'Subject matter'}, {'id': '2', 'title': 'Article 2', 'subtitle': 'Scope', 'text': 'Article 2\nScope\nThis Regulation applies to allowances created for the purposes of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU\xa0ETS).'}, {'id': '2.tit_1', 'subtitle': 'Scope', 'text': 'Scope'}, {'id': '3', 'title': 'Article 3', 'subtitle': 'Definitions', 'text': 'Article 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the definitions in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 and in Article 3 of Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/331\n(\n17\n)\nshall apply.

COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/856
of 26 February 2019
supplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund
(Text with EEA relevance)
THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC (1), and in particular to the fourth subparagraph of Article 10a(8) thereof,
Whereas:
(1)
Detailed rules on the operation of the Innovation Fund should be established taking into account lessons learnt from the NER300 programme established under Directive 2003/87/EC and implemented on the basis of Commission Decision 2010/670/EU (2); notably the conclusions of the Court of Auditors report (3) should be taken into account.
(2)
In order to cover the lower profitability and the higher technological risks of the eligible projects compared to conventional technologies, a significant part of the Innovation Fund financing should be provided in the form of a grant. Detailed rules on the disbursement of grants should therefore be established.
(3)
As the risks and profitability of eligible projects may differ across sectors and activities of those projects and may also evolve over time, it is appropriate to allow for a part of the Innovation Fund support to be provided through contributions to blending operations under the Union investment support instrument, as well as in other forms provided for in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council (4) (the ‘Financial Regulation’).
(4)
It is appropriate to consider the difference between the total costs of an eligible project and the total costs of an equivalent project using conventional technology as relevant costs for the purposes of financing under the Innovation Fund. However, in order to avoid excessive administrative burden for small-scale projects and address their particular difficulties in obtaining financing, the relevant costs of a small-scale project should be the total capital expenditure cost of such a project.
(5)
With a view to making adequate financial resources timely available to the eligible projects, the disbursement of grants should be based on the achievement of milestones. For all projects, the milestones should include financial close and entry into operation. As some projects might need the support to be disbursed at a different point in time, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to determine additional milestones in the contractual documentation.
(6)
In order to increase the probability of success of the projects, the possibility to disburse a part of the grant prior to the entry into operation of a project should be established. The disbursement of grants should in principle start at the financial close and continue during the development and operation of the project.
(7)
The major part of the Innovation Fund support should depend on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions. Substantial underperformance on planned greenhouse gas emission avoidance should therefore lead to the reduction and recovery of the amount of the support dependant on such avoidance. The reduction and recovery mechanism, however, should be flexible enough to take into account the innovative nature of projects supported by the Innovation Fund.
(8)
Grants under the Innovation Fund should be awarded following a competitive selection process, via calls for proposals. In order to reduce the administrative burden for project proponents, a two-phase application procedure should be established, comprising an expression of interest and the full application.
(9)
Projects applying for the Innovation Fund support should be assessed on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The combination of such criteria should ensure the completeness of the project assessment in terms of its technological and business potential. To ensure fair and merit-based selection, projects should be selected based on the same selection criteria, but be evaluated and ranked first vis-à-vis other projects in the same sector and subsequently vis-à-vis projects across sectors.
(10)
Projects whose planning, business model and financial and legal structure appear insufficiently mature, in particular in light of a possible lack of support by the Member States concerned or of the necessary national permits, should not be selected for Innovation Fund support. However, such projects may be promising. Therefore, the possibility to provide development assistance to such projects should be laid down. Project development assistance should in particular benefit small-scale projects and projects in lower-income Member States to help achieving a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support.
(11)
It is important to achieve a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support. To prevent a situation where some Member States are not sufficiently covered, the possibility should be laid down to establish additional selection criteria aimed at achieving geographical balance in a second or subsequent calls for proposals.
(12)
The Commission should ensure the implementation of the Innovation Fund. The Commission should however be enabled to delegate some of the implementation actions, such as the organisation of the call for proposals, pre-selection of projects or contractual management of grants, to implementing bodies.
(13)
The revenues of the Innovation Fund, including the revenues from the allowances monetised on the Common Auction Platform in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010 (5), should be managed in accordance with the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission should therefore carry out that task itself and be enabled to delegate this task to the European Investment Bank.
(14)
The Commission should apply different rules depending on the mode of the implementation of the Innovation Fund. Where the Innovation Fund is implemented in direct management, the provisions of this Regulation should be fully aligned with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.
(15)
Member States should play an important role in the implementation of the Innovation Fund. In particular, the Commission should consult the Member States on the key implementation decisions, as well as on the development of the Innovation Fund.
(16)
The Innovation Fund should be implemented in accordance with the sound financial management principles as laid down in the Financial Regulation.
(17)
Clear reporting, accountability and financial control arrangements should be laid down in order to ensure that the Commission receives complete and timely information on the progress of projects supported by the Innovation Fund, the entities managing the Innovation Fund apply sound financial management principles, and the Member States are in a timely manner informed about the implementation of the Innovation Fund,

Specific provisions applicable to grants
Article 5
Relevant costs
1.   For the purposes of the fourth sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 10a(8) of Directive 2003/87/EC, the relevant costs shall be the additional costs that are borne by the project proponent as a result of the application of the innovative technology related to the reduction or avoidance of the greenhouse gas emissions. The relevant costs shall be calculated as the difference between the best estimate of the total capital expenditure, the net present value of operating costs and benefits arising during 10 years after the entry into operation of the project compared to the result of the same calculation for a conventional production with the same capacity in terms of effective production of the respective final product.
Where conventional production referred to in the first subparagraph does not exist, the relevant costs shall be the best estimate of the total capital expenditure and the net present value of operating costs and benefits arising during 10 years after the entry into operation of the project.
2.   The relevant costs of a small-scale project shall be the total capital expenditure costs of that project.
Article 6
Disbursement of grants
1.   The Innovation Fund support, in the form of a grant, shall be disbursed upon reaching the pre-determined milestones.
2.   For all projects, the milestones referred to in paragraph 1 shall be based on the project development cycle and shall be at least the following:
(a)
financial close;
(b)
entry into operation.
3.   Taking into account the technology deployed and the specific circumstances of the sector or sectors in which it is being deployed, additional specific milestones may be determined in the contractual documents.
4.   Up to 40 % of the total amount of the Innovation Fund support, including project development assistance, to a specific project shall be disbursed upon financial close or upon reaching a specific milestone preceding financial close where such a milestone has been determined in accordance with paragraph 3.
5.   To the extent that the total amount of the Innovation Fund support to a specific project has not been disbursed pursuant to paragraph 4, that amount shall be disbursed after the financial close. It may be partially disbursed prior to the entry into operation and in annual instalments after the entry into operation.
6.   For the purposes of paragraphs 4 and 5 of this Article, the total amount of the Innovation Fund support provided to a specific project shall include the amount of the Innovation Fund support provided to that project by way of project development assistance in accordance with Article 13.
Article 7
General recovery rules
1.   The Commission shall take appropriate measures to ensure that, where activities financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Innovation Fund are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and, if irregularities are detected, by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, where appropriate, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive administrative and financial penalties.
2.   Recoveries shall be implemented in accordance with the Financial Regulation.
3.   The grounds for recovery as well as the recovery procedures shall be further specified in the contractual documentation.
Article 8
Special recovery rules
1.   The amount of the Innovation Fund support disbursed in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 after the financial close shall be dependent on the avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions verified on the basis of annual reports submitted by the project proponent for a period between 3 to 10 years following the entry into operation. The final annual report submitted by the project proponent shall include the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided during the entire reporting period.
2.   Where the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions avoided during the entire reporting period is lower than 75 % of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions planned to be avoided, the amount paid or to be paid to the project proponent in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 shall be proportionally recovered or reduced.
3.   Where the project fails to enter into operation by the pre-determined time or the project proponent fails to demonstrate any real avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions, the amount paid after the financial close in accordance with paragraph 5 of Article 6 shall be fully recovered.
4.   Where the situations referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 occur due to extraordinary circumstances that are beyond the control of the project proponent and the project proponent demonstrates the project's potential to achieve an avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions beyond the reported amount, or where the project proponent demonstrates that the project can achieve significant low-carbon innovation benefits, the Commission may decide not to apply the recovery mechanisms under paragraphs 2 and 3.
5.   The ground for recovery and recovery procedures shall be further specified in the contractual documentation.
6.   The rules laid down in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article shall be without prejudice to general recovery rules under Article 7.

SUMMARY OF:
Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/856 with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund
WHAT IS THE AIM OF THE REGULATION?
              
The Innovation Fund introduced in Directive 2003/87/EC is designed to support innovative initiatives as part of EU emissions trading system (ETS)*, the EU’s cornerstone policy to tackle climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.This regulation sets out detailed rules about how the fund operates.
KEY POINTS
              
The regulation sets out detailed rules for the Innovation Fund, including
operational objectives;
forms of support provided;
application procedure;
how projects are selected;
how the fund is governed;
reporting, monitoring, evaluation, control, and publicity.
Objectives and forms of support
The fund provides financial support for projects demonstrating highly innovative technologies, processes or products with significant potential to reduce GHG emissions, while attracting additional public and private resources.
Support will be in the form of grants, or combining EU grants with financial instruments under the EU’s unified investment support instrument (InvestEU), which replaces the current European Fund for Strategic Investments for the period 2021-2027. Funding can also take any of the other forms outlined in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 (the ‘Financial Regulation’), in particular prizes, and procurement.
Application and selection
Applicants are invited to apply for financial support for eligible projects following a call for proposals issued by the European Commission after consultation with EU countries. Projects are selected based on criteria including:
the potential to avoid GHG emissions;
degree of innovation of the projects compared to the state of the art;
maturity of planning, business model, financial and legal structure; prospect of concluding the financial close of the project within a pre-defined time period of no more than 4 years;
technical and market potential for widespread application or future cost reductions;
cost efficiency of the project based on a formula balancing costs against GHG emissions avoided, energy generated, or CO2 stored (carbon capture and storage) in the first 10 years of operation.
Governance and administration
The Commission directly manages the Fund’s operation except where implementing bodies are delegated. EU countries are consulted about short-listed projects before any decisions on awards are made.
Entities receiving aid should display on their websites information about projects supported under this regulation, including explicit reference to the Innovation Fund support received, as well as ensuring that coherent, effective and targeted information on the support reaches multiple audiences, including the media and the public.
FROM WHEN DOES THE REGULATION APPLY?
              
It has applied since 17 June 2019.

last update 07.10.2019","{'header': '28.5.2019 | EN | Official Journal of the European Union | L 140/6', 'title': 'COMMISSION DELEGATED REGULATION (EU) 2019/856\nof 26\xa0February 2019\nsupplementing Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to the operation of the Innovation Fund\n(Text with EEA relevance)', 'preamble': 'PREAMBLE\n\nTHE EUROPEAN COMMISSION,\n\nWhereas:\n\nHAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\n\n\nWHEREAS:\n\n((1)) Detailed rules on the operation of the Innovation Fund should be established taking into account lessons learnt from the NER300 programme established under Directive 2003/87/EC and implemented on the basis of Commission Decision 2010/670/EU(2); notably the conclusions of the Court of Auditors report(3)should be taken into account.\n\n((2)) In order to cover the lower profitability and the higher technological risks of the eligible projects compared to conventional technologies, a significant part of the Innovation Fund financing should be provided in the form of a grant. Detailed rules on the disbursement of grants should therefore be established.\n\n((3)) As the risks and profitability of eligible projects may differ across sectors and activities of those projects and may also evolve over time, it is appropriate to allow for a part of the Innovation Fund support to be provided through contributions to blending operations under the Union investment support instrument, as well as in other forms provided for in Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2018/1046 of the European Parliament and of the Council(4)(the ‘Financial Regulation’).\n\n((4)) It is appropriate to consider the difference between the total costs of an eligible project and the total costs of an equivalent project using conventional technology as relevant costs for the purposes of financing under the Innovation Fund. However, in order to avoid excessive administrative burden for small-scale projects and address their particular difficulties in obtaining financing, the relevant costs of a small-scale project should be the total capital expenditure cost of such a project.\n\n((5)) With a view to making adequate financial resources timely available to the eligible projects, the disbursement of grants should be based on the achievement of milestones.\xa0For all projects, the milestones should include financial close and entry into operation. As some projects might need the support to be disbursed at a different point in time, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to determine additional milestones in the contractual documentation.\n\n((6)) In order to increase the probability of success of the projects, the possibility to disburse a part of the grant prior to the entry into operation of a project should be established. The disbursement of grants should in principle start at the financial close and continue during the development and operation of the project.\n\n((7)) The major part of the Innovation Fund support should depend on verified avoidance of greenhouse gas emissions.\xa0Substantial underperformance on planned greenhouse gas emission avoidance should therefore lead to the reduction and recovery of the amount of the support dependant on such avoidance. The reduction and recovery mechanism, however, should be flexible enough to take into account the innovative nature of projects supported by the Innovation Fund.\n\n((8)) Grants under the Innovation Fund should be awarded following a competitive selection process, via calls for proposals.\xa0In order to reduce the administrative burden for project proponents, a two-phase application procedure should be established, comprising an expression of interest and the full application.\n\n((9)) Projects applying for the Innovation Fund support should be assessed on the basis of qualitative and quantitative criteria. The combination of such criteria should ensure the completeness of the project assessment in terms of its technological and business potential. To ensure fair and merit-based selection, projects should be selected based on the same selection criteria, but be evaluated and ranked firstvis-à-visother projects in the same sector and subsequentlyvis-à-visprojects across sectors.\n\n((10)) Projects whose planning, business model and financial and legal structure appear insufficiently mature, in particular in light of a possible lack of support by the Member States concerned or of the necessary national permits, should not be selected for Innovation Fund support. However, such projects may be promising. Therefore, the possibility to provide development assistance to such projects should be laid down. Project development assistance should in particular benefit small-scale projects and projects in lower-income Member States to help achieving a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support.\n\n((11)) It is important to achieve a geographically balanced distribution of the Innovation Fund support. To prevent a situation where some Member States are not sufficiently covered, the possibility should be laid down to establish additional selection criteria aimed at achieving geographical balance in a second or subsequent calls for proposals.\n\n((12)) The Commission should ensure the implementation of the Innovation Fund. The Commission should however be enabled to delegate some of the implementation actions, such as the organisation of the call for proposals, pre-selection of projects or contractual management of grants, to implementing bodies.\n\n((13)) The revenues of the Innovation Fund, including the revenues from the allowances monetised on the Common Auction Platform in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1031/2010(5), should be managed in accordance with the objectives of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Commission should therefore carry out that task itself and be enabled to delegate this task to the European Investment Bank.\n\n((14)) The Commission should apply different rules depending on the mode of the implementation of the Innovation Fund. Where the Innovation Fund is implemented in direct management, the provisions of this Regulation should be fully aligned with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.\n\n((15)) Member States should play an important role in the implementation of the Innovation Fund. In particular, the Commission should consult the Member States on the key implementation decisions, as well as on the development of the Innovation Fund.\n\n((16)) The Innovation Fund should be implemented in accordance with the sound financial management principles as laid down in the Financial Regulation.\n\n((17)) Clear reporting, accountability and financial control arrangements should be laid down in order to ensure that the Commission receives complete and timely information on the progress of projects supported by the Innovation Fund, the entities managing the Innovation Fund apply sound financial management principles, and the Member States are in a timely manner informed about the implementation of the Innovation Fund,', 'articles': [{'id': '1', 'title': 'Article 1',
