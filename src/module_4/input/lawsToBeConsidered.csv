COUNCIL REGULATION (EU) No 216/2013
of 7 March 2013
on the electronic publication of the Official Journal of the European Union
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, and in particular Article 352 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the European Commission,
After transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments,
Having regard to the consent of the European Parliament,
Acting in accordance with a special legislative procedure,
Whereas:
(1) Article 297 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) deals with the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (hereinafter ‘the Official Journal’) and the entry into force of legal acts of the Union.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1/1958 (1), including any subsequent amendments thereto, determines the official languages of the institutions of the European Union.
(3) The printed edition of the Official Journal, available in all official languages of the institutions of the Union, is at present the only legally binding publication, although it is also made available online.
(4) Decision 2009/496/EC, Euratom of the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions of 26 June 2009 on the organisation and operation of the Publications Office of the European Union (2) ensures that the Publications Office enables the institutions to fulfil their obligation to publish legislative texts.
(5) The Court of Justice of the European Union has held, in Case C-161/06 Skoma-Lux sro v Celní ředitelství Olomouc (3), that legal acts of the Union are not enforceable against individuals if they have not been properly published in the Official Journal and that making such acts available online does not equate to valid publication in the Official Journal in the absence of any rules in that regard in Union law.
(6) If publication in the Official Journal in electronic form were to constitute valid publication, access to Union law would be faster and more economical. Citizens should, nevertheless, continue to have the possibility to obtain a printed version of the Official Journal from the Publications Office.
(7) The Commission Communication entitled ‘A Digital Agenda for Europe’ highlights that access to online legal content favours the development of a digital internal market, which leads to economic and social benefits.
(8) Rules ensuring the authenticity, integrity and inalterability of the electronic publication of the Official Journal should therefore be laid down.
(9) This Regulation should also lay down rules applicable in cases where, due to unforeseen and exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to publish and to make available the electronic edition of the Official Journal.
(10) Directive 1999/93/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 1999 on a Community framework for electronic signatures (4) establishes the legal effects of electronic signatures as a means for authentication. For the purposes of ensuring the authenticity, integrity and inalterability of the electronic edition of the Official Journal, an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate and created by a secure-signature-creation device in accordance with that Directive provides sufficient guarantees to the public. It should be possible to verify the electronically signed Official Journal by readily available means.
(11) Access to the EUR-Lex website is to be ensured in compliance with the commitments for the protection of persons with disabilities in accordance with Council Decision 2010/48/EC of 26 November 2009 concerning the conclusion, by the European Community, of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (5).
(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective of enabling all European citizens to rely on the electronic publication of the Official Journal, as its scope is limited to making such publication authentic, in the same way as the printed publication is today.
(13) The TFEU does not provide, for the adoption of this Regulation, powers other than those under Article 352,"

,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
In cooperation with the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas several Community Directives set out general provisions which concern in particular procedures for EEC approval, EEC type examination, EEC verification and other EEC certifications; whereas other specific Directives make reference to these  procedures;
Whereas in the context of the procedures for EEC approval and EEC type examination, a reciprocal system of information between Member States and/or authorized bodies as well as notification to the Commission of the certificates granted are provided for;  whereas an extract of the certificates is also to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;
Whereas the experience gained has shown that publication of extracts of certificates and attestations in the Official Journal does not appreciably improve the transparency of the matter, since this is already assured in a satisfactory manner by other  means; whereas publication is therefore not essential and could be discontinued,"

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications (1), and in particular the second paragraph of Article 11 thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Poland has submitted a reasoned request for amendment to Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC.
(2) Poland has requested an amendment to the content of training for the profession of train dispatcher (‘dyżurny ruchu’), a profession which is already included in Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC. These training programmes fulfil the conditions set out in Article 11 (c)(ii) of Directive 2005/36/EC as they provide training which is equivalent to the level of training provided for under Article 11 (c)(i) of that Directive, provide a comparable professional standard and prepare the trainee for a comparable level of responsibilities and functions, as is apparent from the following legislation: Act on the implementation of the education system reform of 8 January 1999 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 1999 No 12, pos. 96); Railway Transport Act of 28 March 2003 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2003 No 86, pos. 789); Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 16 August 2004 on a list of posts directly associated with railway traffic operation and safety, conditions that should be met by persons filling these posts and driving railway vehicles (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2004 No 212, pos. 2152); Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 18 July 2005 on the general conditions for railway traffic operation and signalisation (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2005 No 172, pos. 1444).
(3) Poland has also requested the addition of the profession of train manager (‘kierownik pociągu’) to Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC. The training programmes for this profession fulfil the conditions set out in Article 11 (c)(ii) of that Directive as they provide training which is equivalent to the level of training provided for under Article 11 (c)(i) of that Directive, provide a comparable professional standard and prepare the trainee for a comparable level of responsibilities and functions, as is apparent from the following legislation: Act on the implementation of the education system reform of 8 January 1999 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 1999 No 12, pos. 96); Railway Transport Act of 28 March 2003 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2003 No 86, pos. 789); Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 16 August 2004 on a list of posts directly associated with railway traffic operation and safety, conditions that should be met by persons filling these posts and driving railway vehicles (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2004 No 212, pos. 2152); Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 18 July 2005 on the general conditions for railway traffic operation and signalisation (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2005 No 172, pos. 1444).
(4) Poland has also requested the addition of the profession of inland navigation engineer (‘mechanik statkowy żeglugi śródlądowej’) to Annex II to Directive 2005/36/EC. The training programmes for this profession fulfil the conditions set out in Article 11 (c)(ii) of that Directive as they provide training which is equivalent to the level of training provided for under Article 11 (c)(i) of that Directive, provide a comparable professional standard and prepare the trainee for a comparable level of responsibilities and functions, as is apparent from the following legislation: Act on the implementation of the education system reform of 8 January 1999 (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 1999 No 12, pos. 96); Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure of 23 January 2003 on the professional qualifications and composition of inland vessel crews (Official Journal of the Republic of Poland of 2003 No 50, pos. 427).
(5) Directive 2005/36/EC should therefore be amended accordingly.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION
,
Having regard to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular Article 4(1)(a) thereof,
Whereas:
(1) Directive 2001/95/EC provides for European standards to be established by the European standardisation bodies. Such standards should ensure that products satisfy the general safety requirement of that Directive.
(2) Under Directive 2001/95/EC, a product is to be presumed safe when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing the European standards, the references of which have been published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(3) Article 4 of Directive 2001/95/EC lays down the procedure for drawing up the European standards. Under that procedure, the Commission is to determine the specific safety requirements which the European standards should satisfy and, subsequently, on the basis of those requirements, to give mandates to the European standardisation bodies to draw up those standards.
(4) The Commission is to publish the references of the European standards adopted in that way in the Official Journal of the European Union. Under the second subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, the references to the European standards which have been adopted by the European standardisation bodies before the entry into force of that Directive may be published in the Official Journal of the European Union even in the absence of a Commission mandate, if those standards ensure compliance with the general safety requirement laid down in that Directive.
(5) By its Decision 2005/718/EC (2) the Commission published the references of seven European standards concerning the safety of gymnastic equipment in the Official Journal of the European Union
(6) The seven European standards on the safety of gymnastic equipment concerned by Decision 2005/718/EC are not supported by a Commission mandate adopted in accordance with Article 4(1) of Directive 2001/95/EC.
(7) One of those standards, EN 913:1996, has been replaced by a new version, EN 913:2008. This new version was adopted after the entry into force of the Directive 2001/95/EC and its reference cannot, as a consequence, be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in the absence of a Commission mandate including specific safety requirements.
(8) In order to assess the conformity of the new version and of any subsequent versions of the European standards for gymnastic equipment with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC, it is necessary to re-establish the procedure laid down in Article 4 of that Directive.
(9) The Commission should therefore determine specific safety requirements for gymnastic equipment with a view to mandating the European standardisation bodies to develop relevant European standards for gymnastic equipment on the basis of those requirements.
(10) Once the relevant standards are available, and provided that the Commission decides to publish their references in the Official Journal of the European Union, according to the procedure laid down in Article 4(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, gymnastic equipment is to be presumed to conform to the general safety requirements of that Directive, as far as the safety requirements covered by the standards are concerned.
(11) The measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee set up under Article 15 of Directive 2001/95/EC,"

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Whereas:
(1) Article 157 of the Treaty establishing the European Community assigns the Community and the Member States the task of ensuring that the conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Community's industry exist. Article 151 provides that the Community shall contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the Member States, while respecting their national and regional diversity and at the same time bringing the common cultural heritage to the fore.
(2) The Communication from the Commission ‘i2010 — A European Information Society for growth and employment’ (1) announced a flagship initiative on digital libraries.
(3) The Communication from the Commission ‘i2010: Digital Libraries’ (2) (hereafter ‘the Communication’) announced the creation of a High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries that will advise the Commission on how to best address the organisational, legal and technical challenges at European level.
(4) The White Paper on a European Communication Policy (3) adopted by the Commission on 1 February 2006 mentions the essential role that digital libraries can play in providing free access to European citizens to information on Europe through information technologies.
(5) The group must contribute to a shared strategic vision for European digital libraries.
(6) The group must be made up of highly qualified experts with competence on digital libraries, appointed in a personal capacity.
(7) The ‘High Level Expert Group on Digital Libraries’ therefore has to be set up and its terms of reference and structure detailed,"

Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular Article 4(2), second and fourth subparagraphs thereof,
After consulting the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on information Society Services (2),
Whereas:
(1) Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/95/EC lays down an obligation on producers to place only safe products on the market.
(2) According to Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC a product shall be presumed safe as far as the risks and risk categories covered by relevant national standards are concerned when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards, the references of which have been published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with Article 4 of that Directive.
(3) According to Article 4(1) of the Directive, European standards should be established by European standardisation bodies under mandate set by the Commission. The Commission will publish the references of such standards.
(4) Article 4(2) of the Directive lays down a procedure for publication of references of standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies before the entry into force of the Directive. If those standards ensure compliance with the general safety requirement, the Commission shall decide to publish their references in the Official Journal of the European Union. In these cases, the Commission shall, on its initiative or at the request of a Member State, decide in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15(2) of that Directive whether the standard in question meets the general safety requirement. The Commission shall decide to publish its references after consulting the Committee established by Article 5 of the Directive 98/34/EC. The Commission shall notify the Member States of its decision.
(5) Some standards have however been adopted by the European standardisation bodies since the entry into force of the Directive without a mandate under Article 4(1) of the Directive. The intention of the legislator was to ensure co-operation with the European standardisation bodies and to recognise suitable safety standards applicable to products falling under the scope of the Directive for which a Commission mandate was not issued in accordance with the relevant provisions referred to in Article 4. It is therefore appropriate to consider the publication of the references of such standards and to that aim to proceed according to the procedure provided for in Article 4(2).
(6) This decision on compliance of the standards listed in the Annex with the general safety requirement is taken at the initiative of the Commission.

Having regard to Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (1), and in particular Article 4(2) thereof,
After consulting the Standing Committee set up in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations and of rules on Information Society services (2),

(2) Under Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/95/EC, a product is presumed to be safe, as far as the risks and risk categories covered by the relevant national standards are concerned, when it conforms to voluntary national standards transposing European standards, the references of which have to be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union, in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Directive.
(3) Pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Directive, European standards should be established by European standardisation bodies under mandates drawn up by the Commission. The Commission shall publish the references of such standards.
(4) Article 4(2) of the Directive lays down a procedure for the publication of references of standards adopted by the European standardisation bodies before the entry into force of the Directive. Where such standards ensure compliance with the general safety requirement, the Commission shall decide to publish their references in the Official Journal of the European Union. In such cases, the Commission, acting on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State, shall decide, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 15(2) of the Directive, whether the standard in question meets the general safety requirement. The Commission shall decide to publish the reference of the standard after consulting the Committee established by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC. The Commission shall notify the Member States of its decision.
(5) In November 2000, the Commission sent Mandate M/309 to CEN (European Committee for Standardisation) to draft European safety standards to address the risks of strangulation, injury and entrapment posed by cords and drawstrings on children’s clothes.
(6) CEN adopted standard EN 14682:2004 in response to the Commission’s Mandate. The Commission published its reference in the Official Journal of the European Union
 (3).
(7) In September 2007, standard EN 14682:2004 was superseded by a new version adopted by CEN. This version clarifies the requirements for cords and drawstrings in children’s garments and includes explanatory drawings. The reference of standard EN 14682:2007 is not published in the Official Journal of the European Union.
(8) Between November 2008 and February 2010, the market surveillance authorities of 11 Member States jointly investigated the compliance of children clothes in their markets with the requirements of EN 14682:2007. The project was co-financed by the Commission (4).
(9) The national market surveillance authorities participating in the project submitted more than 400 RAPEX notifications of garments which did not comply with the requirements of standard EN 14682:2007. These notifications accounted for a significant share of the total of RAPEX notifications received in 2009 (5).
(10) This joint project also promoted a more widespread knowledge and raised awareness of the requirements of standard EN 14682:2007 for economic operators along the supply chain.
(11) The Commission considers that standard EN 14682:2007 fulfils its Mandate M/309, complies with the general safety requirement of Directive 2001/95/EC, and that its reference should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 4(2), first subparagraph.
(12) This Decision on the compliance of standard EN 14682:2007 with the general safety requirement is taken at the initiative of the Commission.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES
,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community,
Having regard to Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 1994 on packaging and packaging waste(1), and in particular the second subparagraph of Article 9(4) thereof,
Having regard to the opinion of the Committee set up by Article 5 of Directive 98/34/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 1998 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations(2), as amended by Directive 98/48/EC(3),
Whereas:
(1) Article 4 of Directive 94/62/EC stipulates that the Commission shall help to promote the prevention of packaging waste formation by encouraging the development of suitable European standards.
(2) Article 10 of Directive 94/62/EC indicates that the Commission shall promote, as appropriate, the preparation of European standards relating to the essential requirements referred to in Annex II thereto.
(3) When packaging is manufactured for a specific product in accordance with a harmonised standard whose references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the packaging is presumed to comply with the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as covered by that harmonised standard.
(4) Article 9 of Directive 94/62/EC stipulates that the Commission shall ensure that the references of the harmonised standards which comply with the essential requirements defined by the Directive are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(5) The Member States are required to publish the references of the national standards transposing the harmonised standards whose references have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(6) In 2000, the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) approved five standards (EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000) in line with the mandate which the Commission issued to this body under Directive 94/62/EC, after consultation with the committee set up under Directive 98/34/EC. These standards were presented to the Commission as harmonised standards.
(7) In 2000, in application of Aricle 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Belgium raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000, EN 13431:2000 and EN 13432:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.
(8) In 2000, in application of Article 9(4) of Directive 94/62/EC, Denmark raised a formal objection in respect of harmonised standards EN 13428:2000, EN 13429:2000, EN 13430:2000 and EN 13431:2000, to the effect that these standards do not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive.
(9) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13428:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, with the exception of the requirements of the third indent of Annex II(1) to the Directive. This harmonised standard must accordingly be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities with a warning stating that it does not cover the requirements of that indent.
(10) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13429:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(2) to the Directive. In particular, this standard does not cover the mandated requirement for a minimum number of trips or rotations in normally predictable conditions of use, or define a test method for checking this minimum number of trips or rotations. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(11) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13430:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3a) to the Directive. In particular, the standard does not cover the essential requirements stipulating that in order to be considered recyclable, packaging must be manufactured in such a way as to enable the recycling of a certain percentage by weight of the materials used, according to the type of material used for the packaging. The standard does not, moreover, cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to cause problems in recovery and sorting prior to recycling, in the recycling process itself or in recycled products. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(12) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13431:2000, the Commission was able to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of the Directive, as specified in Annex II(3b) to Directive 94/62/EC, for a minimum lower calorific value to allow optimisation of energy recovery. Furthermore, the standard does not cover the mandated requirement for objective consideration of the use of substances or materials likely to present problems in recovery and sorting prior to energy recovery, or in the energy recovery process itself. Accordingly, this harmonised standard must not be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(13) After consulting the committee created by Directive 98/34/EC and examining harmonised standard EN 13432:2000, the Commission was unable to ascertain that this standard does not fully meet the essential requirements of Directive 94/62/EC, as specified in Annex II(3c) and (3d). This harmonised standard must, accordingly, be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
(14) The Commission now calls on the CEN to undertake work to improve those standards which either in part or in full do not fulfil the essential requirements defined in the Directive,"
