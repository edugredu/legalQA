In cooperation with the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas several Community Directives set out general provisions which concern in particular procedures for EEC approval, EEC type examination, EEC verification and other EEC certifications; whereas other specific Directives make reference to these  procedures;
Whereas in the context of the procedures for EEC approval and EEC type examination, a reciprocal system of information between Member States and/or authorized bodies as well as notification to the Commission of the certificates granted are provided for;  whereas an extract of the certificates is also to be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;
Whereas the experience gained has shown that publication of extracts of certificates and attestations in the Official Journal does not appreciably improve the transparency of the matter, since this is already assured in a satisfactory manner by other  means; whereas publication is therefore not essential and could be discontinued,
